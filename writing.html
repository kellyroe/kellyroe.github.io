The third copy was to be retained by the Univesrity only given out to a third examiner in the case of 'divergent outcomes'.  The Univesrity misused an official documenting in giving that thesis to my supervisor.  They had no business giving it to her.</li>

YOu can see the lengths they go to to ensure that Dr Leeks and Dr Green and Professor Glue etc etc are the only game in town.  Abuse in State Care.  The NZ Governmetn seems to think that that is actually it's function.  NZ is kept as 'New Manus Island' for Australia.  It is in the Australian Constitution that NZ is a State of Australia but Australia won't supply Federal Voting Papers, Passports, Birth Certificates etc.  Won't enrol in qualifications.  Won't graduate from qualifications.  Won't employ for government jobs etc.  Not even trying to be fair.</li>
