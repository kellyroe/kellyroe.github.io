        <body>

               <p>I am in the process of re-skinning the content of this page into a hyper-linked chronological cv that will be available from the home / index page.  I mean to say this page will divert to there only in future.  </p>

               <p>I have written to the University of Auckland requesting access to anything that I submitted to Turnitin.  They required various things to be submitted to Turnitin.  I want my physiology assignments for the second year laboratories.  I want my first year public health assignments.  The whole point of them being uploaded to that repository was that they would be accessible.  No?</p>

               <p>I think I paid the University for a service.  They paid people (maybe) to write comments on my work to justify them giving numeric or letter grades.  Those were supposed to be justification for letter grades that are now associated with me forever on my transcript.  My equals.  Whatever.  The work given to them was supposed to be the reason for.  I commissioned it.  It was commissioned by me.  I paid the University to pay people to grade it.  I want the grading comments that I commissioned.  I want to make the information publically available.  So that people can decide whether they want their work to be assessed by Universities NZ.  Or if they just want to make the work that they have done available to potential employers directly.  Cut out the middle-men.  They aren't doing their job, properly, of being a broker between people's work capacity and people's employment options.  Anyway...  It's my work.  My intellectual property.  I want access to it.</p>

               <p>They might want to pay their graders better and train them more.  I don't know.  They might want to give their VC a payrise and supply a house with space for a dungeon slave.</p>

               <p>Otago has some nice stuff from me (I think) uploaded to Turnitin, as well.  An essay I wrote on Orthopedics, bone density scanning, don't fall down prescrption.  Well well well just stay home at least we all have access to the internet right right and by the way don't fall down.  I'd like that back.  With the grading comments and the letter grade.  I'd like my CELS191 examination script and the markers schedule and the marked version of my script.  So that people can see they did not mark it properly.  They marked the right answer 'wrong' on a couple occasions -  just enough to write me up as A instead of A+.  The same for Bioanthropology.  I'd like the examination question script, please, my answer script, and the grading rubric.  Because we were asked questions with non answer, you see.  So I want to see how they graded it.  THey supplied a list, allegedly of grades given to students enrolled in the class.  They said various students got over 90 per cent in the test.  But I don't see how that's possible when at least some of the questions were obviously to randomise things.  It's sooooo unlikely.  There's just no way...  Actually, that was pathology.  The anatomy one asked us to name structures on pictures that are not named in any textbook that I've ever seen!  Not named in any of the anatomy textbooks on the surgical trainee reading list!  And that's for grad studnets not for 2nd or 3rd year undergrads!  The complete lack of honesty and integrity.  What do grades mean?  Nothing, apparently.  Nothing at all.  Well then...  Give me my work and the comments you wrote on it.  Then people can see the value of the 'university' with respect or regards to..  Upcycling?  Helping?   Helping the work be better?  Or just beating on their 'students'?</p>

               <p>Evidence documents and filings for the legal cases will become part of my cv.  </p>

               <p>You see, here is the scam...  You have various people without the willingness and / or ability to output any work of their own.  What they do is take work from some and either cross out the authors name and write their own name on it (plagarise, in fact) else re-attribute authorship to their friends (who are maybe only their friends because of the same lack of willingness or ability) or maybe just people who are already on payroll -- so that  nobody else needs to be.  I guess that's the idea, isn't it.  NZ only needs to have one micro-biologist (for example) and all work done by anybody else can be re-attributed to Souxie.  Or maybe they have a team of marketing con-municators who re-skin all the work into some con-municative output of the university and Souxie was actually murdered off however many decades ago..  Maybe CHATGPT writes all the microbiology con-munications and nobody needs be on payroll at all.  Maybe the Twits on Twitter or the Bots on Twitter or the Arses on Farcebook...  There's just nothing there, hey.  What University?</p>

               <p>So everybody sends their work to Oxford University Press.  I suppose.  Or MIT press.  Or wherever.  All the very best work.  So they can delay and confuse and obstruct and hold up and prohibit and prevent.  And, so they can ultimately, reattribute it to someone else.  I suppose.  And all the journals...  Why think they would be any different?  However many people send all their work to journals.  Of course that doesn't need to happen, anymore, because the 'Universities' require students to upload all their work to Turnitin so they can fail out the students whose work they most want to reattribute to others.  Hide their outputs  behind a paywall and block access to the author.  That sounds suitably..  Depraved.  Doesn't it?  Wouldn't you say?  Keep handing your work over to supervisors and 'universities' and journals and publishers who do what with it?  Or just cut out the middle-men and publish it yourself.</p>

               <p>How much work is enough to be payrolled, do you suppose?  What I'm really not sure about is whether these over 65's actually are payrolled... Or if it's like the episode of Shameless where they find some random in an old folks home and pass them off as Auntie whomever so that Frank can keep his payroll coming along...  Like how they will not supply the row information on who is employed in the capacity as 'consultant' or 'clinical doctor' in the hospital they won't / can't supply row information on who is employed in teh capacity as professor in the university.  There's nobody there.  Nobody home.  Where is the research output of Universities NZ?  What is the yearly research output of various people whose primary function is supposed to be research?  Their students output more work than they do every year.  And what do they do when it comes to their students?  Bully them into re re re re re enrolling.  Instruct them to take things out and put things in.  In some instances rewriting the whole f*cking thing.  In some instances putting in words that make the student sound stupid.  Gaslighting.  Outputs of the tortured.  There's really nothing there, hey.   </p>

               <p>I walk along Queen Street and there's increasingly nothing there.  Empty spaces, I mean to say.  After commercial bay was built it seemed that there wasn't enough business to fill out the main street.  One way of handling or managing that is make it look like there are art galleries, or some such.  I find myself wondering what about the outputs of the Elam School of Fine Arts, or similar.  All the students.  The ones enrolled in creative production degrees, and so on.  I wonder why they can't put those creative outputs in an empty space and allow the students to sell their work to tourists.  SO that peple can see the work and a blurb from or about the artist and maybe choose to buy that.  Not just tourists.  Alumni.  These people who are supposed to die, one day, and leave their inheritance to the University.  Only they aren't anymore.  Because there isn't any good that they can see.  There's nothing to invest in.  Hey.  Where are the creative outputs of the studnets enrolled in teh creative degrees?  Bullied into fleeing.  Bullied into ceasing production because they make the only people they would payroll to supposedly allegedly or apparently teach them look dull and unproductive.  Just awful.  NZ.  F*cking aweful, hey.</p>

               <p>And it just doesn't make any sense, at all.  It just doesn't make any sense becuase it would seem that the creative outputs from artists, for example, are actually things that can be brought and sold, and so on.  And supposedly the University is all about wanting concrete things concrete outputs.  So...  Where is the bookshop?  With all of the edited collections of essays?  With all of the theses?  The masters theses that are small books?  The larger doctoral books?  The significantly highly developed books about 8 years or something post-graduation?  Most under-productive economy ever.  Hey.  You would think that making money from the arts would be easy.  But there's literally next to nothing there.  Hey.  What a f*cking joke.</p>

This is the start of their thinking that they are entitled to keep me enrolled and working for them as a graduate research student for the maximum time of enrolment involved in the doctoral programme for the possibility of only MPhil credit.  But I only applied to be enrolled in a 120 point MPhil, you see.  A 120 point programme of study, when worked on full-time, is only 34 weeks of work (including the external examination period).  So says the Tertiariy Education Commission.  The people who decide whether or not the University can invoice the government and the student for fees and loans for the programme.  What progamme?  The one the studnet applied to be enrolled in?  Or the one that gets maximum billings for the University?  What University?  They can't even process an application to enrol.  Note that usually (e.g., for under-grads) the final date they need to finalise their enrolment is a couple weeks after the enrolment start date.  E.g., end of week 2 of the first semester for first semester courses.  Note also that later on they offer me an enrolment start date that is earlier than their offer of enrolment.  They don't seem willing (or able?) to keep accurate enrolment records.<li>

                                    <li><a href="writing/squigley.pdf" target="_self">  Quigley (Vice Chancellor) saying I should complain to the Ombudsman and take them to court.  </a>  You can follow my court filings on the judicial review page and see how the judiciary pulled judges from retirement (in some instances) to not see anything wrong.  Apparently NZ 'Universities' can record that students are enrolled in programmes they never applied to.  They can refuse to examine theses submitted for external examination.  They can examine studnets for qualifications different from the ones they were enrolled in.  They can have graduate level students enrolled under 'zero fees scheme'.  They can invoice the IRD for programmes of study they never applied for.  They can refuse to allow externals to sign off on qualification completions by refusing to get studnets work to externals.  They are not functionoing as universities at all.  The judiciary doesn't see anything wrong with any of this.  The Supreme Court says that it is personal against any complainant and not a matter of public interest.    </li>
