They do say that the skeletons in the Anatomy Museums and the Medical Doctors houses are ones that were purchased from India back when that was lawful.  Else ones where the people have voluntarily donated their bodies for teaching purposes.  But I don't know why we would believe that.  I mean, I understand how saying that that is what they are constitutes the best possible defence for them.  But I don't know what evidence there is (e.g., signed consent forms).  I admit that I was quite shocked that students have access to physical bones before they have a good handle on what can be learned from textbooks.  It is part of desensitisation, though.  You start off keeping animals in conditions of torture (as model of a 'coma patient' or whatever) so that you become desensitised.  You start off poking at and drawing on bones and dead people and unconscious people so that you become desensitised.  You need to appreciate all of the work that goes into training the next generation of wrongful deathbringers and sexual offenders to take over where Dr Leeks left off.  The applications to enrol in Medicine or Psychiatry that he decided to process (and the ones he decided to throw away).  The people he acknowledged as progressing through their training satisfactorily (and the ones he bullied away).  The ones he signed off on completion of training so that they could go on to have institutions of their own.  The lengths that the Australasians went to to protect him.  Apparently he is not fit to stand trial (in the name of psychiatry).  But we have learned what treatment he thinks is appropriate for people (in the name of psychiatry).  What consideration did he give for his victims?  Why is he now worthy of consideration that he did not show his victims? It just shows what a farce Australasia is.  Medicine.  Also Law.

                                <p>My University of Waikato transcript shows that I completed an Honors year in Philosophy and I certain passed that year with a high GPA.  My University of Waikato transcript then shows that subsequently to having completed that Honors year the University recorded me as having been enrolled in a Masters Degree with enrolment dates spanning 2 academic years and 1 summer school period.  Now, there are 2 year (240 point) Masters Degrees.  The first year of a 2 year Masters Degree is comprised of the honors level coursework, however.  That is or means to say that the only difference between a BA(hons) and a BA, MA (240 point MA) is that the second has a one year research project on the end of it (and the students grades might have not been sufficient for enrolment in the Honors programme).  I did not do a 240 point MA, however.  I had done Honors already (passed it with very high grades).  I did a 120 point research only MA and the University recorded my enrolment dates as spanning 2 academic years and 1 summer school period.
                                </p>

                                <p>I strongly suspect that what happened was that the University of Waikato double billed or double invoiced (at least) the New Zealand Government for keeping me enrolled. The numbers don't add up.  The problem is not that I can't do math.  The problem is something different, entirely.

                                    I started my PhD in 2006.  I was offered J1 visa to be visiting scholar at University of North Carolia Chapel Hill for 1 academic year so I could audit courses and teach in the US.  I notified the ANU so that my scholarship payments were put on hold.  My enrolment should have also been suspended while I did this since I was out of the country and there would not be any evidence of anybody from the ANU remotely supervising me over that time.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                    I have asked the ANU to supply me with my student records.  They have not supplied me with my full records.  They have withheld various things including (1) my application for summer research scholarship and any records on my progress as summer research scholar.  This would show my having supplied a writing sample and comments that were supplied by the department, then, in support of my being granted the summer research scholarship.  (2)  my application for PhD starting 2006.  This would have included 2 writing samples from me that were commented on by people in support of my application for PhD.  I have records showing that the department told the administration that my progress was good and fine and they wanted more and more and more money for keeping me enrolled under more and more and more extensions.  I have asserted that they did not provide supervision to me and they did not get my work to external examiners.  They say there is no evidence of this.  I have asked them to supply me with evidence of supervision.  I met with my supervisor less than three times, I would say, in his office.  There should be evidence of my having emailed him work or him having provided comments on my work or him having provided instructions to me to read or make changes.  But there isn't any evidence of him doing any of that because he did not do any of that.  There won't be evidence of him telling me to get my work softbound to go to externals by any date because he never told me to submit my thesis for examination.  I don't know why they kept paying him but they did.  Apparently they still do but he doesn't supervise anybody actually.  I applied to do a PhD to start 2022 to see how they would handle my application to enrol.  They say that they decline me because I did not supply a writing sample. But they have 3 from me on file, already that were assessed by them, already.  I also supplied to them a link to my writing page.  You can see for yourself all the writing samples over there including a book chapter with OUP.  They say that they don't have the capacity to supervise me.  The Australian National University, Australasias Premiere Research University does not have the willingness or ability to employ anybody to supervise research in Philsophy.  Well, now.  Party party party.  Let's have a party.

                            <p>
                            I applied to enrol in a 120 point MPhil research project with the University of Waikato in 2018.  They refused to enrol me in the programme I applied to and instead of that they enrolled me in various programmes I never applied to and invoiced those programmes to my Student Loan without my permission.  I submitted theses for examination on 14 September 2018, 05 October 2018, 05 February 2019, 24 February 2019, 30 June 2019.  They refused to get the theses to externals, they sent theses to be examined for the wrong qualification, they refused to send theses to externals.  They required me make changes that my supervisor (and not externals) required so that externals couldn't sign off on the changes the externals required me to make.  When an external wanted an oral examination the University said I failed to meet requirements and updated my transcript to record that after working for more than 120 points I failed.  I failed various qualifications that I never applied to be enrolled in.  That were charged to my student loan without my permission.
