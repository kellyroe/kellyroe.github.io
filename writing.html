                                  <li>The first of these was sent out for external examination only after more than 3 months had passed since I submitted it for external examination and I had left the country.  The second of these was never sent out for external examination. I am still waiting on my supervisor to provide supervisory comments on it and / or get it to externals if he is unwilling and / or unable to do the job for which he has been paid.  The third of these was (1) not sent out to externals (2) sent out for examination for the wrong qualification (3) not sent out to externals (4) sent out to externals months late  -- so externals could only conclude I had not done the changes they required within 10 weeks.  (5) The university then refused to schedule an oral examination (requested by the only examiner outside Australasia) maintaining that both external examiners were unanimous that I failed to meet the requirements of a 120 point MPhil (since the university refused to get my work out to externals in a timely fashion).</li>

                                  <li>I am not sure what other students needed to do in order to get timely sign off (if they were allowed to complete in a timely fashion).  I don't know what has to happen for the University to get the work out to externals in a timely fashion when the student has provided the work to the university regardless of whether or not the people employed by the university to supervise are willing or able to do their job or not.  It is not fair that the university chooses to employ people who are not willing or able to do the job for which they are paid so that the univesrity can collect up more and more and more money for keeping the student enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled effectively working as slave.
                                  </li>

                                  <li>I exhausted internal complaints resolution at both the University of Waikato and also the Australian National University.  The Australian National University has instructed me to revise and resubmit my complaint to them 4 times, now, and they are still refusing to process or progress the complaint.  The Vice Chancellor has been informed and he is making the exectutive decision.  The University of Waikato instructed me to take them to court if I did not like the result (that they recorded I was re-enrolled in programmes of study I had never applied to be enrolled in and recorded as having failed programmes of study that I had never applied to be enrolled in while they refused to get my work to examiners and / or sent it out to be examined for the wrong qualification before writing on my transcript that I failed to meet requirements for the Degree I applied to because they refused to get my work out to externls in a timely fashion.  Australasia does not appear to have a functioning education system, health system, or judiciary.</li>

                                  <li>It is in the Australian Constitution that NZ is a state of Australia.  Despite this Australia refuses to supply federal voting papers, Australian birth certificates or passports, refuses to process applications for certain ('high value') government jobs, refuses to process applications for government benefits (e.g., retirement).  Australia chooses to regard NZers as second or third class Australians where what little rights it acknowledges for Australian citizens it does not acknowledge for people of the state of NZ and where the public institutions in NZ receive no federal funding.  I don't know what the NZ government does with all the tax money but they surely don't fund social services.  Prison or detention camps up and down the land.  Hostages.

In other words, I am to supply more 'work' to the Univesrity and more money for them as well because they chose to send it out to be examined for the wrong qualification.
