                                <p>My University of Waikato transcript shows that I completed the BA(Hons) (a 4 year programme of study) in 3 full time years (more than 120 points per year) and one part time year (less than 120 points in that year).  I was able to complete the 4 year programme of study in less than 4 years (including one part time year) because of  how I distributed  my workload with 9 papers during the years when I was full time.
                                </p>

                                <p>I then started a 120 point research only masters degree with the Univesrity of Waikato.  They kept me enrolled in that programme of study for 2 full academic years and 1 summer school period.  I was told I needed to submit the thesis by November 30 and I did that.  I remember trying to enrol in the PhD with ANU at the end of February of the following year and they were on the phone to Waikato about whether Waikato wasn't planning on re-enrolling me with Waikato for yet another year.  I mean, how many years could it possibly take to complete a 120 point Masters research project from an Australasian University?  They had it for 3 months and I don't  believe they had even sent it out to external examiners, yet.
                                </p>

                                <p>I remember Benjamin Gibbs resigned from the University of Waikato because they had refused to get a History students PhD out to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit anybody from signing off on completion of the qualification.  The University said that they internally judged it to be a neo-Nazi manifesto.  That means to say when you try and get your to work to external examiners then they accuse you of having written a neo-Nazi manifesto.  So they can keep you enrolled, keep you enrolled, keep you enrolled, or bully you into fleeing without recieving your Degree.  I don't know what you are supposed to do in order to get the Universities of Australasia to do the job for which they are paid.  I really don't know what various people have done in order to get credit for their work.  I don't know what the problem is.  Sterelny said, at one point, that he refuses to acknowledge work (including his own) that was done more than 3 years ago.  I suppose the idea is that work that has not received credit or acknoweledgement for the author within 3 years is regarded by the Universities to be abandonware that they can give to others to pass of as their own.  That is the best explanation that I can come up with as to why the Universities of Australasia are so determined to bully me out and away from the Universities, now.  Now that they have received a lifetime's worth of research.  Right?  So that other people can be on payroll.  So they can take the kiddies scuba diving and so on.

                                <p>My student file notes show that I supplied the table of contents for this document to the University Administration.  They also record Sterelny saying that he received this work.  He claims that it is 50,000 words in length (whereas my word count asserts that it is 2x this).  You will have to check his email outbox for what supervision he provided to me after he received this work from me.  I mean to say, I was, at that time, located in New Zealand. Any supervision contact between him and myself was by email.  Where is the evidence of him telling me what I needed to do to it before it would go out to externals? Where is the evidence of him telling me that he was unwilling or unable to supervise me so if I wanted to complete then I should just submit it and see what the externals have to say?  There is no evidence of him contacting me about that document and there is no evidence of him providing any supervision at all to be in response to his having acknowledged that he received that document.  The University and Sterelny took my work and refused to progress it or allow me to have any credit for it.  Where is my PhD?

                                <p>This is more thesis work that I emailed to Sterelny.  You will be able to find it in his email inbox.  Where is the evidence of supervision and supervisory comments in his email outbox?  I think there will be some supervisory comments because I do seem to be responding his comments in particular in a couple of places.  What is supposed to happen,  here?  Is he going to write it for me, is he?  When is he going to start working, then?    <a href="judicial-review/Kim.pdf" target="_self"> This is what he says to me now.</a>   I see.  Well, thanks for all your supervision Sterelny.  I see why they pay you.  How old are you?  On payroll.  All of the payroll for you.  All of the payroll for you.  All of the money for you.  What do you do, again?  Go off on holiday and get your students housesitting for you and so on.  What a f*cking farce.  Or, in your words: What a f*cking c*nt.  F*cked the dog, mate.  How f*cking eloquent.  Waiting for you to die, Sterelny.  So the rest of us might live.  Hey, I know, I'll be the slave in the 'Evolved Apprentice' -- right?  That's a great job, for me!  I can spend my days publicising your work.  What is it you say 'there are some things slaves won't do'.  Looks at me meaningfully.  Why did Carl Brusse have to do 2x PhD's for only 1x PhD credit?  Hehehehehhehehhehe is he  because Carl Brusse is stupid?  No...  Carl Brusse is not stupid.  But you are a psychopath.  For sure.

                            <p>
                            And now we have a succession of about 5 theses where the University of Waikato refuses to acknowledge that any of them is enough for even Masters Level Credit (a degree that I have already earned).  The only reason why I applied to be enrolled in the 120 point Masters research programme with Waikato (again) was  because the University of Auckland claimed to have the power and authority to deem any qualification earned by a NZ university more than 5 years ago to be obsolete or expired.  This is not something that the Statute allows them to do (they do not have power to deem domestic adults ineligible).  But New Zealand does not appear to even be trying a teeny tiny little bit to be rule  by law.  I suppose if you take a look at the outputs of the Judiciary over on the Judicial review page then you will see for yourselves why that is.  That the law is nothing other than a joke in these garbage lands that have been overtaken by psychopaths collecting up all the money for themselves and wasting everybody else's time.  F*cking psychopaths.
