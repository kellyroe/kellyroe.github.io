How did they get me working for 2 years on a 120 point 1 EFT Masters?  I don't know...  There are some 2 year Masters programmes (that have Honors Year course work for the first year for people who have not done their Honors year).  But they bully most students into taking 2 years to do a 1 year (research only) masters.  Saying that they will fail them if they don't take 2 years to do the research.  Then they tell them they are limited to 50,000 words only and they arrange for the 2 years of research to be examined for masters qualification only.  I know many other people who the Universities have required to take 2 years to do a 1 year research only Masters project.  It is the new normal in these lands.  The effect of it is to force people to take only part-time credit for part-time research since 120 points of research across 2 years of study means that the status is part time over 2 years.  So it doesn't count for your full time GPA.  So it is wrong of them to say that people should do a 1 year masters in order to bring up their GPA since they will refuse to examine the work if you don't agree to take at least 2 years (and likely 2 years and at least 1 summer school if not 2 summer schools) for the possibility of only 120 points Masters credit.

It was also never sent out for external examination.  The University tells me that I cannot prove this.  If there were comments on it they would be found in Kim Sterelny's outbox.  I allege there are no such comments in Kim Sterelny's outbox.  He was on payroll to be my supervisor and he refused to supervise me.  He also refused to get out of the f*cking way, then, and simply get my work out to externals.  He could have said 'you f*cked the dog, mate, when they put me on payroll to be your supervisor.  You will get your qualification over my dead body'.  Oh, wait, he said that last part, actually.

They decided that since I submitted it in time to have 3 months external examination completed within the 1 EFT enrolment time (TEC says that is a minimum of 34 weeks) they would refuse to get it to external examiners.  They never sent it to external examiners. </li>

                                <li><a href="writing/mphil2018-10-03.pdf" target="_self">Disability and Equity in Medicine and Public Health (05 October, 2018).</a> The University sent this out for examination for the wrong qualification (requesting 'doctoral examination' of the masters thesis.  This was to force externals into saying that if it was to be acceptable then it would require doubling in length (aka it would require changes to the substance).  The university believed that if the examiners said it needed changes to the substance they could then require me to renroll for 6 months more labor followed by 3 months more examination followed by up to 10 weeks of changes to typos and the like (and they could invoice me and the government for fees for all of this enrolment -- an enrolment time more than 2x that of the 120 point qualification that I applied to).  </li>
                                </li>

                                 <li><a href="writing/mphil2019a.pdf" target="_self">Disability and Equity in Medicine and Public Health (24 February, 2019).</a>  I maintain these were the changes the examiners asked of me.  The University maintains they were not.  The University refused to get my work to external examiners so that external examiners could decide for themselves whether or not I had done the changes they required for me to have credit for the 120 point MPhil that I had applied to be enrolled in.  They refused to get the work to examiners to hold me as hostage or slave. </li>

                                  <li><a href="writing/mphil2019b.pdf" target="_self">Disability and Equity in Medicine and Public Health (30 June, 2019).</a>The University re-enrolled me for 6 additional months (so they could collect up more and more and more money from the Governmetn for keeping me hostage).  That is to say they enrolled me in courses that I never applied to be enrolled in.  This is charged to my student loan.  I mean to say the IRD is keeping false records about NZ citizens recording levels of debt that are false.  My supervisor instructed me to make changes that were differnet from what changes the examiners asked me to make, in their reports.  The University is not allowing students to work to internationlly accepted standards of scholarship.  They are trying to force students to work to local standards that they believe will be unacceptable to international community.  Stabotage. </li>

                                  <li>The only external examiner outside Australasia said that they wanted an oral defence (to see why the University was failing me) and the University stated both externals were unanimous that I failed to meet the requirements of the 120 point MPhil Degree and they updated my transcript to keep false records of my being enrolled and then failed for programmes I had never applied to be enrolled in. 
                                    </li>

                                  <li>Australasia does not appear to have Universities.  They are functioning as slave or hostage or detention camps.  They collect up more and more and more money from the Government (and often the student as well) for more and more and more student fees and they are not doing their job of employing people willing and able to supervise research and they are not even doing their job of getting work the student has submitted for external examination out to external examiners so that it can be examined on it's academic merits.  
                                  </li>

                                  <li>I was instructed to follow internal complaints resolution at both the University of Waikato and also the Australian National University by the Vice Chancellor's of both Universities.  They then used their internal complaints resolution policy to try and gaslight me into believing that I hadn't complained.  The used the policy to delay and obstruct justice only.  Waikato instructed me to file with the courts if I was not happy with how they had treated me.  They chose to spend tens of thousands of taxpayers dollars employing external council (a private firm in Hamilton) to defend their being able to enrol students in programmes of their choosing (e.g., ones the student never applied to be enrolled in), their being able to double and triple bill for keeping students enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled, their  being able to simply refuse to get work to externals until more and more and more money had been paid and more and more and more time had passed.  The High Court of NZ had a judge pulled out of retirement for the occasion (also the occasion of the 'unexplained' death of Mason Pendrous at the University of Canterbury) to find that he couldn't see anything wrong.  Presently the court of appeal has deemed the proceedings abandoned since I was unable to pay them more than $14,000 security for costs they demanded of me to appeal both the substantive and costs judgment of the High Court.  The Social Security Tribunal is now ruling on whether I am to receive 'advance benefit payment' to allow the High Court proceedings.  I informed Una Jagose, David Parker, Chris Hipkins, Jacinda Ardern, Judith Collins (leader of the opposition at the time), David Seymour (opposition) that Crown Law needed to prosecute the University for keeping false enrolment records (e.g., double billing) and false transcripts (recording that I failed when they refused to get my work to examiners in order to prevent them signing off that I passed).  They all refused to use discretion they have (discretion they choose to use in other cases) to order people employed by the Government to DO THEIR JOB.   </li>

                                  </li> The Australian National University has instructed me to revise and resubmit my complaint to them 4 times, now, and, after I gave them 3 revised and resubmitted complaints, they are still refusing to process or progress the complaint.  The Vice Chancellor has been informed and he is making / he is responsible for the exectutive decision.  THey say I have no evidence that my supervisor failed to supervise me.  I have pointed out the f*cking obvious.  I can't provide evidence for something that is not there.  Any evidence he has of him supervising me will be in his official email outbox,  however.  I maintained that he provided no written comments on my written work and no instructions to me as to what I was to do working under his supervision.  THe University kept me as a hostage (collecting up more and more and more money from the Governmetn for keeping me enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled) while doing none of the things they were supposed to do (supervise me, get my work out to external examiners in a timely fashion).   Australasia does not appear to have a functioning education system, health system, or judiciary.</li>

                                  <li>Apparently it is because it is sooooo competitive.  The likes of Kim Sterelny want all the research funding for themselves so they don't want other people to apply for research funding. They don't want other people to be granted research funding.  They want to be the only applicant for it.  They want to be the only game in town.  They want to be obviously or clearly the best applicant for it.  That means they have a psychopathic interest in undermining and stabotaging anybody who they perceive to be an alternative or a competitor.  Kim Sterelny seems to think he has successfully eliminated or removed most of the Philosophy of Mind from Australasia.  Most of the Philsophy of Psychology.  Now there is just Philosophy of Biology and aspects of History that his wife does.  So nobody else is allowed to function, then, or have their thesis signed off on or apply for funding or receive funding or whatever.  Because he's such a friendly guy who is really very professional (not).
                                </li>

                                  <li>It is in the Australian Constitution that NZ is a state of Australia.  That is what the document says.  Despite this, Australia refuses to supply federal voting papers, Australian birth certificates or passports, refuses to process applications for certain ('high value') government jobs and also for training programmes (e.g, HECS supported Medicine), refuses to process applications for government benefits (e.g., retirement).  Australia chooses to regard NZers as second or third class Australians where what little rights it acknowledges for Australian citizens it does not acknowledge for people of the state of NZ and where the public institutions in NZ receive no federal funding.  I don't know what the NZ government does with all the tax money but they surely don't fund social services.  Prison or detention camps up and down the land.  Hostages.
                                </li>

                                <li>How much work are you supposed to do for PhD credit?  How about for a 1 year Masters?  How about for a lifetime of Academics?  Australasia cannot claim to be part of the developed world, at all.  They don't have functioning Universities.  They do not have an education and training system, at all.  They have a system of slave or detention or prison camps only.  WHen I was Sterelny's studnet he wrote 'the Evolved Apprentice' which was supposed to be about the things that go into an Education and Training Programme.  He then chooses to use me as an example of how Australasia does not have Education and Training Programmes.  They refuse to train me.  They refuse to get out of the f*cking way and get my f*cking work that I gave them to external examiners.  Allllllll of the funding for them.  Allllllll of the funding for them.  Lllllll of the funding for them to keep slaves.
