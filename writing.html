                                <p>I think it is important that the enrolment dates on this involve 2 academic years and 1 summer school period.  That way, if a prospective studnet is wondering if they want to do a MA and they peruse the MA theses they can get a handle on what kind of project happens over what length of time.

                                    I started my PhD in 2006 and I had 1 academic year off from being enrolled in my PhD.  I was careful not to work on my PhD during the year off.  So, this represents 5 years work.  It does seem to me to be something of a monstrosity that could be crafted into two PhD theses, perhaps.  I guess that's because nobody bundled my work that was done in the first 2 years and helped me unpack that so as to complete a 3 year thesis in 3 years (given the examination period).  What does the Australian Government pay the University for?  Supervision?  Whose job is it to do what,  now?

                                        I have recently requested my records.  I am not sure how much NZ thinks it is supposed to be following Canberra, is my concern.  Since I left my PhD from Australia New Zealand has been treating me like I'm intellectually handicapped.  So maybe I need to sort things out from here: <a href="judicial-review/ANU.pdf" target="_self"> Letter  </a> explaining that they will get back to me in 'weeks' (which I interpreted to mean within 1 month). <a href="judicial-review/anu-time.pdf" target="_self">They subsequently informed me they intended to reply on or about June 15.</a>

                                <p>This is more thesis work that I sent to Sterelny.  Unsolicited, to be fair.  There is also a very recent statement of non-support so you can see how Sterelny talks to me.  It is hard for me to know how to interpret it.  Maybe it helps other people within the ANU look at it and go 'hey, this doesn't seem fair'.  I don't know.  He has always said there would never be a job for me. But his boys were the real apple of his eye.  And there were not jobs, in New Zealand, for his boys.  So... <a href="judicial-review/Kim.pdf" target="_self"> Statement of non-support</a>.  I suppose...  I don't know what power I think he has around Medical Admissions.  I know that various ANU PhD grads went on to study Medicine from completing their ANU PhD.  But they were all Australian Citizens.  I did not think that that was an option that was available to me.  I thought I needed to return to NZ and then NZ said they wouldn't acknowledge an ANU PhD anyway, and I needed to complete a NZ Degree in the 'minimum normal or standard time' which is problematic since nobody is allowed to complete a graduate research qualification from a NZ University in the minimum, normal, or standard time, so far as I can see...

                            I applied to enrol in a 120 point MPhil research project with the University of Waikato in 2018.  They refused to enrol me in the programme I applied to and instead of that they enrolled me in various programmes I never applied to and invoiced those programmes to my Student Loan without my permission.  I submitted theses for examination on 14 September 2018, 05 October 2018, 05 February 2019, 24 February 2019, 30 June 2019.  They refused to get the theses to externals, they sent theses to be examined for the wrong qualification, they refused to send theses to externals.  They required me make changes that my supervisor (and not externals) required so that externals couldn't sign off on the changes the externals required me to make.  When an external wanted an oral examination the University said I failed to meet requirements and updated my transcript to record that after working for more than 120 points I failed.  I failed various qualifications that I never applied to be enrolled in.  That were charged to my student loan without my permission.
