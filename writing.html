Apparently NZ 'Universities' can record that students are enrolled in programmes they never applied to.  They can refuse to examine theses submitted for external examination.  They can examine studnets for qualifications different from the ones they were enrolled in.  They can have graduate level students enrolled under 'zero fees scheme'.  They can invoice the IRD for programmes of study they never applied for.  They can refuse to allow externals to sign off on qualification completions by refusing to get studnets work to externals.  They are not functionoing as universities at all.  The judiciary doesn't see anything wrong with any of this.  The Supreme Court says that it is personal against any complainant and not a matter of public interest.    </li>
