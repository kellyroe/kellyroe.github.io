<p>This is something of a construction site.  My writing is currently available via my CV that you can find top of the index page.  </p>

<p>I am working on my cv so that there will be links to my entire life's work -- that, of course, you don't pay me for.  Right, Sterelny?  They don't pay you for the work you are going to do -- they pay you for the work that you have already done.  Really? When?  When do they f*cking pay me, Sterelny?  How old are you?  Past retirement age?  But they pay you.  They pay you.  THey pay you.  They pay you?  Or maybe it's like Shameless and you are f*cking well dead, already.  So your salary gets diverted to your children, or something.  F*cking psychopath.  </p>

<p>Aw.  I can't do anything else.  They won't let me.  THey don't pay me they don't pay me they don't pay me they don't pay me.  Are they f*cking well dead yet?  They don't pay me.  Hurry up and die you f*cking c*nts (as Sterelny would say).  F*cking hurry up.  Is it dead yet?</p>

<p>  Apparently they pay Jacinda  She gets  3 fellowships without having applied for 1.  Who writes her a reference for that, then? She supposedly gets payrolled because she is going to write a book -- and not because she f*cking well wrote a book for every year she was kept enrolled.  What enrolments?  Can't even / won't even process the f*cking enrolments properly.  The employments.</p>

<p>What a f*cking joke, hey.  Shame about the health system.  Not even trying to have one.  Can't even / won't even process an application to enrol.  Can't even / won't even graduate people when (and only when) they've done the work for their qualifications </p>

<p>Nobody from the Australian National University had an oral defence.  I didn't see anybody with reports from external examiners.  Did anybody actually graduate from that institution?  Various people from there claim to have been given academic jobs both in Australia and overseas, including the US.  How does that happen when the 'University' won't get their work out to externals and won't schedule an oral defence?  When the people on payroll won't write references?  What a f*cking scam, hey.  How do they get visas etc?  What a f*cking joke.</p>

<p>This page will be permanently retired in the new year.</p>

This is the start of their thinking that they are entitled to keep me enrolled and working for them as a graduate research student for the maximum time of enrolment involved in the doctoral programme for the possibility of only MPhil credit.  But I only applied to be enrolled in a 120 point MPhil, you see.  A 120 point programme of study, when worked on full-time, is only 34 weeks of work (including the external examination period).  So says the Tertiariy Education Commission.  The people who decide whether or not the University can invoice the government and the student for fees and loans for the programme.  What progamme?  The one the studnet applied to be enrolled in?  Or the one that gets maximum billings for the University?  What University?  They can't even process an application to enrol.  Note that usually (e.g., for under-grads) the final date they need to finalise their enrolment is a couple weeks after the enrolment start date.  E.g., end of week 2 of the first semester for first semester courses.  Note also that later on they offer me an enrolment start date that is earlier than their offer of enrolment.  They don't seem willing (or able?) to keep accurate enrolment records.<li>

Apparently NZ 'Universities' can record that students are enrolled in programmes they never applied to.  They can refuse to examine theses submitted for external examination.  They can examine studnets for qualifications different from the ones they were enrolled in.  They can have graduate level students enrolled under 'zero fees scheme'.  They can invoice the IRD for programmes of study they never applied for.  They can refuse to allow externals to sign off on qualification completions by refusing to get studnets work to externals.  They are not functionoing as universities at all.  The judiciary doesn't see anything wrong with any of this.  The Supreme Court says that it is personal against any complainant and not a matter of public interest.    </li>
