                                  <li>Most of these theses were hoarded by my supervisor/s and / or the University so that they could collect up more and more and more money for keeping me enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled.  One of them was sent out to be externally examined for the wrong qualification.  Apprently my only formal qualification is that I completed a MA in 2006.  Since that qualification is more than 5 years old it is no longer acknowledged by New Zealand Universities.</li>

                                  <li>I initiated Judicial review of administrative action for the University of Waikato keeping an unlawful detention or slave camp rather than a University.  The courts, thus far, refused to uphold justice.  The courts award more and more and more and more costs against me the more and more more they instruct me to revise and resubmit my filings, you see.  New Zealand does not appear to have a functioning judiciary, health system, education system.  The Australian National Univesrity (therefore Australia) does not seem to be faring any better in that respect.  It is actually in the Australian Constitution that NZ is a State of Australia but they refuse to supply voting papers and they refuse to process or progress applications to enrol etc from NZ citizens when it suits them.  Also refusing to process applications for government employment and also government benefits etc.  There is no federal funding for NZ public institutions.</li>
