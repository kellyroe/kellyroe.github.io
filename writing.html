I was required to accept "Limited Full Time Status" so the University would be paid for at least 14 months of enrolment (which was what they predicted in my 6 monthly review would happen, then to be followed by at least 3 months of external examination).  This 14 months of minimum enrolment was then to to followed by an indefinite period of detention through an indeterminately long examination process.  Firstly, up to 3 months of external examination that may then be followed by an oral examination and another round of up to 3 months external examination.  There may also be up to 10 weeks (2 1/2 months) of substantive changes...  And apparently the University decides whether or not it is 'appropriate' for them to get the students work to external examiners or whether they are not done with you, yet. This is how all the Universities of New Zealand keep their graduate research students working indefinitely, or working until such time as their visas expire or they pay the bribe or...  It eventually becomes embarrassing for the University that they forced you to slave for so long and then they just want to see the back of you.  You are expected to leave with your head down and your tail between your legs believing that there is something wrong with you.  Would you like to do business with the New Zealand government?  It is quite disabling.  Where does the money go?</li>
