I lodged 2 hard copies of the completed thesis with the University.  1 was to be kept in the library.  1 was to be kept in the Philosophy Department.  Where are they?  The Auckland hospital is drugging people and gaslighting them and recording them as delusional so it can keep them detained.  Because not enough people are presenting for health services, one can only suppose.  So they need to unlawfully detain people in conditions the UN would likely say amount to torture.  They don't want to help people with delusion to get better.  They want to record more and more and more people have delusion so they can keep them locked up in punative conditions.  Like Janet Frame.  Right?  All of the literary output for none of the pay.  So that the people paid to do literary output can either steal others work and pass it off as their own else simply take the money for doing none of the work.  Like all the people employed by the University to research who produce less research work every year than their first year students do.  There is really nothing here.  Nasty nation of slavers.

The University administration was also informed that I had written a document with 100,000 ++ word count and they never provided instructions to me on what I needed to do to get them to get it to externals.  I mean to say that the person on payroll to supervise me and the people on payroll to administrate refused to get work out to externals.  The prevention and prohibition of research output seems to be the purpose goal or point.

Still the University refuses to forward it to external examiners.  They say I voluntarily withdrew my thesis submission.  Who does that?  Who does a bunch of work and then says 'you know what, just call me a volunteer.  I don't actually want to be paid'?  Who walks away from a PhD programme after having written more than 100,000 words so that they can be regarded as 'failed' when the University simply will not get the work out to external examiners.  What University?</li>

                                <li><a href="writing/mphil2018-10-03.pdf" target="_self">Disability and Equity in Medicine and Public Health (05 October, 2018).</a> The University sent this under 50,000 word Masters thesis out with instructions for it to be examined with respect to acceptability as a 'doctoral thesis'.  Carolyn Mason from the University of Canterbury wrote one of the 'doctoral reports' of my under 50,000 words masters thesis submission.  She provided enough comments for me to turn it into a 100,000 words PhD.  Only trouble was I wasn't enrolled in that programme of study.  My word limit on the Masters was 50,000 words only.  Doesn't she have her own research to be getting on with?  Why waste so much time writing so much in response to a 1 year Masters Research thesis?  How much work is supposed to be enough for a Masters research thesis to be acknowledged?  I had more than 70 references ffs but still she thinks I need to do more reading.  It's a 1 year research project ffs.  A 120 point 1 EFT programme of study with 3 months of external examination.  So it needs to go out for external examination after around 6 months work.  How much research did she do in around 6 months?  How much research does she do every year?  More or less than 5,000 words do you suppose?  I guess they don't pay her to be a research academic at all.  What do they pay her to do?  To bully everybody else into leaving because there will be qualifications and jobs for them only over her dead body one can only suppose. </li>
                                </li>

                                 <li><a href="writing/mphil2019a.pdf" target="_self">Disability and Equity in Medicine and Public Health (24 February, 2019).</a>  I maintain that these were the changes the examiners asked of me that were doable within the 50,000 word Masters thesis limit.  I provided it to the University to get to examiners within 10 weeks so I could complete the 120 point MPhil without re-enrolment being required.  Because I applied to be enrolled in a 120 point programme of study only.  And the University only did everything they could to try and bully me out of completing it on time.  Refusing to get my work to examiners.  Telling me it was garbage, not good enough. I needed to take 2x the standard time.  I must be forced to be a slow worker.  To work more slowly than them.  The people on payroll to not output any research at all.  </li>

                                  <li><a href="writing/mphil2019b.pdf" target="_self">Disability and Equity in Medicine and Public Health (30 June, 2019).</a>  This was the 6 months additional labor version of the 120 point ++ Masters thesis that was changed in ways the University of Waikato required of me rather than in ways the external examiners required since they told me it was at their discretion whether or not they awarded me the Degree.  The University then said they choose to fail me and if I don't like how they treated me I can file and refile and refile and refile and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay legal fees and legal costs and file and refile and pay and pay and pay the courts. </li>

                                  <p>I wrote to Carolyn Mason (email) and explained to her that the University was not getting the external examiners my work that I was supplying to them for external examination.  I informed her that I had in fact written the external examiners extensive commentary explaining that I could not make all the 'doctoral' changes they instructed me to make since I was limited to only 50,000 words of content only for the Masters Degree.  I explained why I made the changes I did and why I didn't make some of the changes (I responded to the critique).  Carolyn Mason knew I was the author of the work.  That is or means to say it certainly was not the research output of Justine Kingbury.  But there was no point in having an oral defense, she says, because I didn't follow instructions to keep slaving indefinately on a 34 week programme of study therefore no 120 point MPhil credit for me.  NZ does not have Universities.  </p>
