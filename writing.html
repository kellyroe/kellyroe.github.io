                                <p>This was not submitted for examination until I had completed 2 academic years of enrolment.  Since it was a 120 point research only MA that means I was working with only part-time status and the grade does not count towards my full-time GPA.  Fortunately, I wasn't doing the MA in order to improve my GPA.  So my full-time GPA is derived from my undergraduate and honors year - where I completed more than 120 points per year for most of those years.

                                    Over on the Seminars page you will find a few articles that I wrote that I presented as seminars.  I can't locate much of my past PhD work but I did find this monstrosity that, I believe, was the state of my thesis in 2012.  It is quite the monstrosity since I'd been working on it with very little supervisory input for 5 years.  It is almost 2 whole PhD's packed into 1 document!

                                        I have requested the ANU provide me with their records of what supervision I received and what progress my supervisors said that I was making towards submission of my thesis for external examination.  Here is a link to a <a href="judicial-review/ANU.pdf" target="_self"> letter  </a> explaining that they will get back to me in 'weeks' (which I interpreted to mean within 1 month). The people on pay-roll then required <a href="judicial-review/anu-time.pdf" target="_self">extra-time until 'on or about June 15'.</a>

                            <p>
                            I applied to enrol in a 120 point MPhil research project with the University of Waikato in 2018.  They refused to enrol me in the programme I applied to and instead of that they enrolled me in various programmes I never applied to and invoiced those programmes to my Student Loan without my permission.  I submitted theses for examination on 14 September 2018, 05 October 2018, 05 February 2019, 24 February 2019, 30 June 2019.  They refused to get the theses to externals, they sent theses to be examined for the wrong qualification, they refused to send theses to externals.  They required me make changes that my supervisor (and not externals) required so that externals couldn't sign off on the changes the externals required me to make.  When an external wanted an oral examination the University said I failed to meet requirements and updated my transcript to record that after working for more than 120 points I failed.  I failed various qualifications that I never applied to be enrolled in.  That were charged to my student loan without my permission.
