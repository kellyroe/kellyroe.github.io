They tried to say my submission 'didn't count'  because I track and traced delivery of it to the Dean of the School of Research, University of Waikato, and they said that I addressed it incorrectly because I never should have sent it to the person who was responsible for getting it out to external examiners.  Apparently I was supposed to hand it in in person (so there wouldn't be a written record of when I submitted it). </li>

                                <li><a href="writing/mphil2018-10-03.pdf" target="_self">Disability and Equity in Medicine and Public Health (05 October, 2018). </a>  They sent the 1 EFT 1 year 120 point under 50,000 word Masters Thesis out with instructions for externals to examine it with respect to acceptability as a 'doctoral thesis'.  A doctoral thesis (PhD is a 3 EFT 3 year 360 point under 100,000 word) project.  They sent it out to be externally examined for the wrong qualification!  Best I can figure they did this so that the external examiners would be required to say that insofar as the thesis was acceptable (as a doctoral thesis -- since they'd been asked to examine the under 50,000 word Masters thesis and write 'doctoral reports of it') it would require changes to the substance (another 50,000 words to be added, in fact, it to be doubled in length) and more enrolment.  THey sent it out to be externally examined for the wrong qualification!  </li>
                                </li>

                                 <li><a href="writing/mphil2019a.pdf" target="_self">Disability and Equity in Medicine and Public Health (24 February, 2019).</a>  The University Calendar Regulations list the outcomes of external examination that were available to the examiners.  The outcome is supposed to be based on reports of 2 external examiners.  The Calendar Regulations state that 'substantive changes' (changes to the substance) can be either (1) completed within 10 weeks without re-enrolment being needed else (2) the student is to be re-enrolled for 6 additional months followed by another 3 months extenral examination period (that's another 9 months which would mean requiring the student to repeat the year or take 2x the standard time).  The University Calendar says that when re-enrolment is required the examiners will 'return the thesis to the candidate'.  Both of the external examiners kept my thesis, however.  They kept my intellectual property.  The Univesrity had my supervisor write to them and ask them to return the copies they had been sent to the University so the University could get the thesis back to me and neither of the external examiners returned the thesis to me or to the Univesrity.  The Univesrity refused to accept that the external examiners had chosen to keep my thesis rather than returning it to me.  THe external examiners made that decision after reading the Calendar Regulations and reading my Masters thesis that they had been instructed to examine as a doctoral thesis or PhD.  They supplied comments to me suggesting how I could change the substance so as to add another 50,000 words to the f*cking thing so that it would be of doctoral length.  But I wasn't enrolled in the PhD with the Univesrity of Waikato, I never applied to that programme, they had no right to send my thesis out for external examination for the wrong qualification to try and get more and more and more and more money for me as a full fee paying doctoral student.  I got the external examiners this updated version within 10 weeks.  It was the best I could do to do the changes they said while keeping it within the under 50,000 word limit that there was on the qualification that I was enrolled in.  I also wrote an extensive commentary to the NZ examiner because I felt badly for her that the Univerity had asked her to examine my thesis for the wrong qualification and she wrote such a lengthy commentary and analysis and so on of a project tha was just supposed to be a 120 point 1 year of work under 50,000 words project.  Completed in 1 academic year.  1 year of research.  That was what I applied to be enrolled in and what I did.  This was the version where I updated everything within the 10 weeks AND THE UNIVERSITY REFUSED TO GET IT TO EXTERNALS BECAUSE THEY GET MORE AND MORE AND MORE MONEY FOR HAVING ME REENROLLED AND NOBODY IS ALLOWED TO COMPLETE 1 YEAR OF RESEARCH IN 1 YEAR.  The 'Univesrity' of Waikato is not a University.  It is not possible to do research work there.  They don't do any of the things that they are supposed to do.  The University administration will not allow it.   </li>

I spent another 6 months doing everything my supervisor told me to do to the theis.  They sent out the thesis that I updated on the basis of her instructions.  The NZ examiner wrote that they accepted that the Univesrity of Waikato failed me.  The overseas examiner requested oral defence.  The Calendar Regulations say when the examiners are divergent the third copy is to go out to a third examiner.  Instead of sending the third copy out to a third examiner (so they can write about whether I've done enough work over 2 years for credit for an under 50,000 word Masters Degree) the Univesrity says that the external examiners agreed that it wasn't passed so they updated my transcript to record that I failed.  My transcript records that I was enrolled in an MPhil with the University in 2019 (a programme of study I never applied to be enrolled in) and the University recorded that I was failed for that Degree.  They sent a bill to the Inland Revenue for course fees that they say I owe them for my being enrolled in the programme of study that I never applied to be enrolled in.   </li>
