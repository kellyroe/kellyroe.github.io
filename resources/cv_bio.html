		<h1>  Biography </h1>

		<p>
			I attended Hamilton Christian School (4-6 years), Melville Primary, Melville Intermediate, Melville High, Fraser College, and obtained University Entrance by way of B Bursary from Fairfield College, of Hamilton, New Zealand. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I enrolled in my local University, the University of Waikato, and studied Philosophy, Psychology, English Literature, and Education.  I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts, First Division, First Class Honors in 2004.
		</p>

		<p>Summer of 2003/2004 I obtained a Summer Research Scholarship to the Australian National University.  I was supervised by Professor Martin Davies and I worked on his Australian Research Council funded project of delusions.</p>

		<p>2004 I was awarded a Masters Research Scholarship from the University of Waikato. I was supervised by Dr David Lumsden. 
		</p>

		<p>2006 I was granted an Australian Post-Graduate Award Scholarship to study for my Doctorate in Philosophy (PhD) from the Australian National University.  My supervisors were Professor Kim Sterelny and Professor David Chalmers.  Professor Daniel Stoljar was the third member and chair of my supervision panel.</p>

		<p>2008 I was awarded an Australian National University Vice-Chancellor's Travel Scholarship to assist me with expenses towards my being a visiting scholar to the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, for the 2008-2009 Northern Hemisphere Academic Year.
		</p>

		<p>2012 I returned to New Zealand with the intention of studying Medicine and training to be a Psychiatrist. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The University of Auckland instructed me to complete a new qualification from a NZ University for purposes of &#8220;eligibility&#8221; even though the Education and Training Act states that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible to be enrolled in the programme they have applied to, by Statute.  It was on their advice that I applied to be enrolled in a 1 year MPhil Degree with the University of Waikato in 2018.  
		</p>

		<p>
			The University of Auckland said that my GPA was not high enough for entry to Medicine.  When I pointed out that they had miscalculated my GPA according to their published algorithm they said that they didn't need to enter anything at all because I was &#8220;ineligible to have applied&#8221;. 
		</p>

		<p>The University of Waikato would not get my thesis submission of 14 September 2018 out for external examination.  I submitted it in time for 3 month external examination to be completed in the 2018 academic year, but they would not get it out to externals.  The first text revised version (05 October, 2018) was then sent out by the University with instructions for external examiners to write &#8220;doctoral reports&#8221; of the under 50,000 words thesis so that the externals would be required to say that changes needed to be made to the content (more words added to the content, extra time spent working on the content).  They sent it out to be externally examined for the wrong Degree!
		</p>

		<p>The University of Waikato would not get the 2nd and 3rd text revised versions back to external examiners.  They sent me a letter saying I had one month to comply with demands of the letter to re-enrol and pay more fees to the University in 2019 else I would never qualify to complete the qualification.  The 4th text revised version of June 30, 2019 (more than 12 calendar months after the University recorded that I started working on the 120 point 1 EFT 34 weeks including the external examination period MPhil qualification that I had applied to be enrolled in) was sent out for Masters examination.  The New Zealand based external examiner (Carolyn Mason of the University of Canterbury) wrote that she would be &#8220;embarrassed to be associated with it now&#8221; and she accepted that the University had failed me for the qualification.  The only examiner based outside Australasia wrote that he wanted there to be an oral defence.  The University updated my transcript to record that I was re-enrolled for extra time and then failed for the qualification. </p>

		<p>The entire time I was at the ANU nobody had a publically scheduled oral defence of their thesis.  I did not see anybody with reports from external examiners.  I did my work (I have uploaded it here).  Why are various others on payroll and not me? </p>

		<p>Ashley Bloomfield never applied to do a PhD.  He did not do the work for one.  He doesn't have any doctoral level research outupt.  We are supposed to believe that he was the most qualified applicant for the position of Professor of Public Health with the University of Auckland.  We are supposed to believe that they didn't have any applications from people with a PhD.  They didn't have any applications (for the position of Professor) from anyone with any research output.  Nobody was more qualified to be Professor than Ashley Bloomfield.  How many hundreds of thousands of dollars per year do they pay him?  While they keep me on unemployment (less than minimum wage).  All of the research output that I have done.  F*cking psychopaths.  </p>

		<p>We are supposed to believe that nobody was more qualified than Jacinda Ardern for the position of Professor at Harvard!  She never applied to do Honors and she doesn't have the equivalent of a US college degree!  She never applied to do a doctorate, she never did doctoral level research, she doesn't have any research output.  How did she (how did Ashley) get it into their heads to be applying for employment as paid Professors when they never even applied to do a PhD?  What education and training system?  Well, pay Sterelny to write a slavery maifesto, then.  How many decades of enrolment is associated with a PhD at the ANU?  No reports from external examiners (they won't send the work out) no publically scheduled oral examinations or defences.  There's nothing there, hey. </p>

		<p>Was I a paid post-doctoral fellow for Martin Davies ARC grant?  No, that would be Andy Egan.  How did I do compared to Andy?  Our research output on Delusions.  Andy was paid -- how much?  And he did enough work to get a postion at Rutgets after the post-doc.  Where was his research output on delusions?  How did it compare to mine, then?  When I wa a paid summer scholarship recipient?  Did I do enough for a nice reference from Martin Davies, then?  Did I do enough to START my PhD?  I started my PhD in 2006.  End 2007 it should have gone out to externals.  Compare the state of my research work with the other students of my cohort:  Weng Hong, JC, Aiden, Drew, Katrina, Hatha.  Send it to externals.  Ding ding ding ding.  Time is up.  And then you pay your workers.  No?  Pay Sterelny to write a slavery mainfesto.  Is it dead yet? </p>

		<p>The New Zealand examiner said she'd be embarrassed to be associated with my thesis now.  Really.  It's a f*cking embarrassment who academia chooses to have on payroll, alright.  Ashley is the most qualified person for the position of Professor of Public Health but I haven't done enough for a post-doctoral fellowship.  I haven't done enough to pass a first year university essay in public health.  I haven't done enough for entry to medicine (an undergrad level degree) in NZ.  Ashley has done enough to be Professor!  The Ombudsman needs to go becuase he's too old (if he doesn't like it can complain to the UN) and not because he didn't see anything wrong with how various people were kept in our hospital.  Have various people done enough to be appointed head of the psychiatric ward?  Have they done enough to be appointed surgeon?  </p>

		<p>New Zealand and Australia have never paid me minimum wage for employment.  Look at the various other people they choose to employ instead of me.  Look how much money they choose to pay Sterelny to write his slavery manifesto so that he could refuse to get my work out for external examination.  He has no supervisoin comments etc for me.  Why do they pay him?  What do they pay him for?</p>

		<p>The Ombudsman has declared how he feels it is appropriate to keep people.  Do unto others.  He has declared how he wishes and chooses for himself to be kept.  In his hospital or his aged care institution.  He doesn't see anything wrong with various things.  Do unto others.  He has declared how it is appropriate for others to keep him.  Look at the world that he made.</p>

		<p>Martin Davies etc won't write me references to say that I did my work.  I upload my work here.  They did not help me with it.  How much were they paid to supervise me?  Did they do the work for which they were paid?  </p>
