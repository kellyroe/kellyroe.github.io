		<h1>  Biography </h1>


		<p>Professor Martin Davies picked me to be a summer research scholar of the ANU.  Apparently that was a competitive thing.  Professor Laurie Paul told me that she had read my writing sample and recommended they offer the scholarship to me on the basis of that.  That I should read David Lewis on Personal Identity rather than focusing on the nature of the self.
		</p>

		<p>Andy Egan was a post-doctoral fellow and Tim Bayne were also there, over the summer, when I was working on Martin Davies ARC funded project on delusions.  He gave me pre-print material from the PPP journal and set me weekly writing tasks.  He met with me weekly.  He had no problems with my work over the summer to the best of my knowledge.  All the work that I did.  I referenced him.  I referenced the people he gave me for the purposes of my referencing them.  I did the work.</p>

		<p>Where is my acknowledgement for the work that I did?</p>

		<p>I returned to the Australian National University.  Martin Davies says he's off to Oxford but make my application as generally appealing as possible, or similar.  Tamar Gendlar says 'sorry that Cornell didn't bother to let you know your application to study your PhD was unsuccessful.  Just writing you a note from Harvard to say that (as a person named as potential supervisor) your application was processed but unsuccessful.  We meant to send you a rejection letter but guess you never got it.</p>

		<p>Dave Chalmers, Kim Sterelny, and Daniel Stoljar were named supervisors on my panel.  I don't think I chose them or chose that specifically or particularly but that was the composition of my panel.  I wrote `some thoughts on pain' for Dave Chalmers.  He gave me the Tye and Dennett articles and told me to write on that.  I gave the seminar presentation to a consciousness at the beach workshop where there were people there from Brown, MIT etc etc.  They listen to me talk.  They ask some questions.  I handed over my writing.  I got no comments from Dave.  No `good good keep going' or `read this next' or `you need to change these bits because they are wrong.  Nothing.  So I moved to working on other things. Thanks for nothing.  Supervisor.  I see why they pay you hundreds of thousands of dollars to supervise me.  Thanks for nothing.</p>

		<p>When should I get my work to Philosophers Index, Dave, so it can be published?  Maybe your problem is that you don't know how to get things published in a timely fashion that you don't think your job as my paid supervisor is to teach me.</p>

		<p>Kim Sterelny gives me Dominic Murphy's book manuscript.  So I read it.  He suggests that I write a book review of it.  I can't do that.  Why?  Because it's all over the place.  It's not a coherent book.  It's many chapters about all kinds of different things.  I guess it's the tortured outputs that you get when you force people to work for however many years overtime without them being acknowledged in a timely fashion and being allowed to move on to working on other things, or...  I don't know...  But I don't feel good about writing a book review of it.  I'm not particularly convinced by it's methodology etc.  I'm still trying to parse it...</p>

		<p>I write a bunch of stuff.  Referencing Dominic Murphy.  Referencing Paul Griffiths.  Let me tell you a story about Paul Griffiths.  It goes like this..  Martin Davies tells me to make my application broadly applicable and email Daniel Stoljar as Department Chair about supervision and supervisory panel and all that.  Daniel Stoljar tells me that Paul Griffiths might be a potential external supervisor on my panel.  I read his book on emotions and write to him and say that I found it interesting etc.  He asks me to apply to Univesrity of Queensland where he was employed.  I said that I looked at the deadline and it was a couple days back.  He said to apply anyway and he'd help it along.  I did that.  I got offered a PhD scholarship, modern office, pentium 4 computer.  I declined.  Paul emails me from University of Sydney to ask me to write a letter on why I declined.  I was supposed to say because Paul had moved to Sydney.  But it was becuase I never should have been offered the position because my application was recieved late.</p>

		<p>Martin Davies tells me not to apply to the USA and to Australia to do a PhD in the same year.  If I was offered a place at the ANU and I accepted and then USA offers me a place and I accept that and don't go to Australia then the way the funding rounds work means that the ANU missed out on having a Philosopher.  So I didn't apply to both in the same year.  Because I was trying to do right by the ANU.  When did Martin Davies or the ANU try to do right by me?</p>

		<p>Kim Sterelny is the editor of a Journal.  Other studnets have feature articles published in it.  Why don't I get my work published in it?  Whose job is it to do what, now?  Kim Sterelny didn't give me written comments.  He didn't meet with me.  No supervisory meetings.</p>

		<p>I had precisely one supervisory meeting with Daniel Stoljar.  He told me to get him writing in advance, which I did.  When I turn up to the meeting he pulls it out of the printer (not having read it in advance) and says he's going to have to stop me at the end of the first sentance to ask why I mean by first key word.  He launches into a big lecture about 4 things I might mean etc etc.  The second sentance (which he hadn't read yet) answered that.  Said specifically what I meant.  </p>

		<p>Old white guy says old white guy says old white guy says.</p>

		<p>When do I get to speak?</p>

		<p>Hi Patrick Forber.  I understand I'm supposed to be enamoured by you, you being the new Daniel Dennett and all. When do I get to speak?</p>

		<p>I see the fact that I referenced Dennett so much got other people angry and upset that I wasn't (as they saw it) fan boy-ing over them.  Then Wakefield was a relatively convenient person for me to launch my stuff.  People got upset over that, too.</p>

		<p>I think the safest thing for me is probably to stick to people who are dead.  Plato.  Locke.  Berkeley.  Hume.  Descarted.  Early modern philosophy.  That's a nice area for a student to work in or on.  You don't have to worry about people getting upset that you aren't fawning over them.</p>

		<p>Dave and Kim were editors of major journals or whatever.  When do they tell me to get work to them so I can be published?  When does my thesis go out for external examination?  When do I get to speak?  Old white guy says old white guy says old white guy says.  I was good enough to be picked to do it before the imposters moved in.  I mean to say that John Matthewson (or Oliver, or whatever his name is) never studied Philosophy as an undergraduate.  How could he possibly have met requirements for enrolment in the Doctoral programme?  What the hell was he doing in the Philosophy Programme of the ANU?  How could he possibly be the most qualified person to teach Philosophy to undergraduates at University of Massey, Albany?  It defies credibility.  Old white guy, hey.  Old white guy says.</p>

		<p>I think that quite a few things that were atrributed to some were never authored by them.  The scummy scam goes that Sterelny says that things are abandonware 5 years post.  That means to say that people who aren't on payroll send their work to him and he waits 5 years till they've been bullied away entirely and then he reattributes the work to other people.  I don't think that Brett and John co-auhored various things they claimed to have etc.  </p>

		<p>I guess the same thing happens now where people apply for jobs by handing over teaching curriculum contents etc.  So that the people already on payroll can simply take it and teach from it directly.  It's just a scummy hoax of a scummy scam.  It defies credibility.</p>

		<p>It's soooooo competitive that there's actually nothing there in fact.  When it's time to get my thesis out for external examination it won't.  So, of the various others...  Did any of them have theses go out for external examination?  David Bourget is IT person who builds Philosophers Index etc -- right?  Does he neven write Philsoophy?  Or take from others and reattribute to himself?  It defies credibility.  Brett Calcot.  Talk to him for 5 minutes about his academics.  John Matthewson didn't even have entry criterion for doctoral.  Did anybody have their work go out for external examination?  Anybody have reports from externals?  Nobody had a publically scheduled oral examination or defence.  THere's nothing there, hey.  What a f*cking hoax of a f*cking scammy scummy scam.  What university?</p>

		<p>What a f*cking farce of a f*cking joke.</p>

		<p>I do teaching work.  Where are my references?  Where are my references for having done a couple years teaching for the ANU?  I was paid to do a 3-4 year doctoral thesis.  Where is credit.  Acknowledgement.  Recognition.  </p>

		<p>Well close it down then.  No reasearch school of social science.  No philosophy programme.  There is nothing there.  Garbage dump of a waste land.</p>

		<p>Karen Riley invites me to her Australian Citizenship ceremony.  Why invite me (who can't do that since they changed the laws to prevent New Zealanders) and not her Australian friends?</p>

		<p>Thanks for nothing.</p>
