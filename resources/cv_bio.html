		<h1>  Biography </h1>

		<p>

			I attended Hamilton Christian School (4-6 years), Melville Primary, Melville Intermediate, Melville High, Fraser College, and obtained University Entrance by way of B Bursary from Fairfield College, of Hamilton, New Zealand. 

		</p>

		<p>
			I enrolled in my local University, the University of Waikato, and studied Philosophy, Psychology, English Literature, and Education.  I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts, First Division, First Class Honors in 2004.
		</p>

		<p>Summer of 2003/2004 I obtained a Summer Research Scholarship to the Australian National University.  I was supervised by Professor Martin Davies and I worked on his Australian Research Council funded project of delusions.</p>

		<p>2004 I was awarded a Masters Research Scholarship from the University of Waikato. I was supervised by Dr David Lumsden. 
		</p>

		<p>2006 I was granted an Australian Post-Graduate Award Scholarship to study for my Doctorate in Philosophy (PhD) from the Australian National University.  My supervisors were Professor Kim Sterelny and Professor David Chalmers.  Professor Daniel Stoljar was the third member and chair of my supervision panel.</p>

		<p>2008 I was awarded an Australian National University Vice-Chancellor's Travel Scholarship to assist me with expenses towards my being a visiting scholar to the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, for the 2008-2009 Northern Hemisphere Academic Year.
		</p>

		<p>2012 I returned to New Zealand with the intention of studying Medicine and training to be a Psychiatrist. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The University of Auckland instructed me to complete a new qualification from a NZ University for purposes of "eligibility" even though the Education and Training Act states that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible to be enrolled in the programme they have applied to, by statute.  
		</p>

		<p>
			The University of Auckland would not enter my GPA into their published  algorithm for selection and offer me a place if and only if my rank order score was high enough.  First they informed me that it was not high enough (by miscalculating my GPA as 8.0) and then they simply refused to enter a GPA for me, at all, saying I was "ineligible to have applied for enrolment". 
		</p>

		<p>
			 New Zealand is presently working through issues of apologising to survivors of past abuses in Psychiatry.  New Zealand is not presently engaging in a fair and transparent academic merits based selection process for people to enrol in Medical Degrees.  They seem to be interested to enrol people who will work to continue on abuses and / or work to cover up abuses only.  There does not appear to be any psychiatry in New Zealand.  Else the nature of psychiatry is more along the lines of Szasz critique of it as a mechansim for social control.  The problem of evil, indeed.
		</p>

		<p>The University of Waikato would not get my thesis submission of 14 September 2018 out for external examination.  I submitted it in time for 3 month external examination to be completed in the 2018 academic year, but they would not get it out to externals.  The first text revised version (05 October, 2018) was then sent out by the University with instructions for external examiners to write "doctoral reports" of the under 50,000 words thesis so that the externals would be required to say that changes needed to be made to the content (more words added to the content, extra time spent working on the content).  They sent it out to be externally examined for the wrong Degree!
		</p>

		<p>The University of Waikato would not get the 2nd and 3rd text revised versions back to external examiners.  They sent me a letter saying I had one month to comply with demands of the letter to re-enrol and pay more fees to the University in 2019 else I would never qualify to complete the qualification.  The 4th text revised version of June 30, 2019 (more than 12 calendar months after the University recorded that I started working on the 120 point 1 EFT 34 weeks including the external examination period MPhil qualification that I had applied to be enrolled in) was sent out for Masters examination.  The New Zealand based external examiner (Carolyn Mason of the University of Canterbury) wrote that she would be "embarrassed to be associated with it now" and she accepted that the University had failed me for the qualification.  The only examiner based outside Australasia wrote that he wanted there to be an oral defence.  The University updated my transcript to record that I was re-enrolled for extra time and then failed for the qualification. </p>

		<p>I have presently been making inquiries of the Australian National University as to what I need to do in order to have formal acknowledgement from them that I have a conferred doctoral qualification.  I supplied a document more than 100,000 words in length to my supervisor Professor Kim Sterelny in 2011 before I left Australia.  That document was never sent out for external examination.</p>

		<p>The entire time I was at the Australian National University (as a summer research scholar and then as a doctoral candidate) I never saw any doctoral candidate with a publically scheduled oral defence or oral examination.  I heard various people say that they had been informed that external examiners did not require them to make any changes to their thesis.  I wonder, however, whether their theses were ever actually sent out for external examination at all.  No examiners ever turned up and questioned the candidates to ensure that the thesis that they had submitted was actually their own work, for example.  I don't know how anybody graduated with doctorates from the Australian National University or why anybody would think that I didn't do comparable work during the 3-4 years of enrolment that is supposed to comprise the length of a PhD from Australasia.</p>

		<p><a href="https://newsroom.co.nz/2024/02/22/psychiatrists-apology-to-lake-alice-victims-should-take-one-more-vital-step/">The Royal Australasian College of Psychiatry.</a>  That is Psychiatry, in Australasia.  That is to say, there isn't any.  The Medical Schools are not processing applications according to their published algorithms and people are Registered with Professional Practice Organisations in order to bully, abuse, and commit atrocities, or cover up the atroctities of others.  There is no helping Psychiatry Develop or Developing Psychiatry.  There isn't any Psychiatry.  Wakefield and other theorists might well be right about the state of Psychiatry in New York.  They are not right about the state of Psychiatry in Australasia.  There is nothing here.  There isn't any Medicine when there isn't any informed consent.  There's nothing here.
