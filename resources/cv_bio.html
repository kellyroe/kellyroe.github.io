		<h1>  Biography </h1>


		<p>If you read through my academic work you will see me referencing my supervisors etc appropriately.  They do not acknowledge my contribution.  Old white guy says etc etc etc.  As such I work in `Early Modern Philosophy', or similar,  now.  I mean to say that I don't read or reference the work of anybody who is currently living.  Why?  Because the male ego won't allow me to reference one without another one going postal.  So I don't reference any of them any more.  Check out the work I did for Professor Martin Davies.  Where is my acknowledgement?  Check out the work I did for Dominic Murphy and Paul Griffiths.  Where is my acknowledgement?  I did work for Dave Chalmers.  Where is my acknowledgement?  My supervisors did not have supervisory meetings with me.  They did not comment on my written academic work.  They did not instruct me.  They are editors of major journals etc.  Dave Chalmers does the Philosophers Index.  When is my work going up there, Dave?  Thanks for nothing.  My life is so very very very much worse for all of these old white guys who were paid how much again to supervise me?  Alllll of the money for them and nothing for me.  F*cking psychos.  Indeed.  Old white guy says old white guy says how f*cking tedious.  Freud wants to have sex with his daughter and kill of his wife.  Counter-transference much?  How many hundreds of  hours did he spend trying to persuade his daughter that her fantasy was to give him a male child?  What a f*cking farce.  Old white guy says old white guy says old white guy says.  Are the old white guys dead yet?  So other people can have a life, for a change?  All the women and children voluntarily suicided so they didn't have to listen to old white guy says any f*cking more.  F*cking psychos.  Where is my money hey???  Hello?   F*cking psychos.  Thanks for f*cking nothing.</p>
