		<h1>  Biography </h1>

		<p>
			I attended Hamilton Christian School (4-6 years), Melville Primary, Melville Intermediate, Melville High, Fraser College, and obtained University Entrance by way of B Bursary from Fairfield College, of Hamilton, New Zealand. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I enrolled in my local University, the University of Waikato, and studied Philosophy, Psychology, English Literature, and Education.  I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts, First Division, First Class Honors in 2004.
		</p>

		<p>Summer of 2003/2004 I obtained a Summer Research Scholarship to the Australian National University.  I was supervised by Professor Martin Davies and I worked on his Australian Research Council funded project of delusions.</p>

		<p>2004 I was awarded a Masters Research Scholarship from the University of Waikato. I was supervised by Dr David Lumsden. 
		</p>

		<p>2006 I was granted an Australian Post-Graduate Award Scholarship to study for my Doctorate in Philosophy (PhD) from the Australian National University.  My supervisors were Professor Kim Sterelny and Professor David Chalmers.  Professor Daniel Stoljar was the third member and chair of my supervision panel.</p>

		<p>2008 I was awarded an Australian National University Vice-Chancellor's Travel Scholarship to assist me with expenses towards my being a visiting scholar to the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, for the 2008-2009 Northern Hemisphere Academic Year.
		</p>

		<p>2012 I returned to New Zealand with the intention of studying Medicine and training to be a Psychiatrist. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The University of Auckland instructed me to complete a new qualification from a NZ University for purposes of &#8220;eligibility&#8221; even though the Education and Training Act states that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible to be enrolled in the programme they have applied to, by Statute.  It was on their advice that I applied to be enrolled in a 1 year MPhil Degree with the University of Waikato in 2018.  
		</p>

		<p>
			The University of Auckland said that my GPA was not high enough for entry to Medicine.  When I pointed out that they had miscalculated my GPA according to their published algorithm they said that they didn't need to enter anything at all because I was &#8220;ineligible to have applied&#8221;. 
		</p>

		<p>The University of Waikato would not get my thesis submission of 14 September 2018 out for external examination.  I submitted it in time for 3 month external examination to be completed in the 2018 academic year, but they would not get it out to externals.  The first text revised version (05 October, 2018) was then sent out by the University with instructions for external examiners to write &#8220;doctoral reports&#8221; of the under 50,000 words thesis so that the externals would be required to say that changes needed to be made to the content (more words added to the content, extra time spent working on the content).  They sent it out to be externally examined for the wrong Degree!
		</p>

		<p>The University of Waikato would not get the 2nd and 3rd text revised versions back to external examiners.  They sent me a letter saying I had one month to comply with demands of the letter to re-enrol and pay more fees to the University in 2019 else I would never qualify to complete the qualification.  The 4th text revised version of June 30, 2019 (more than 12 calendar months after the University recorded that I started working on the 120 point 1 EFT 34 weeks including the external examination period MPhil qualification that I had applied to be enrolled in) was sent out for Masters examination.  The New Zealand based external examiner (Carolyn Mason of the University of Canterbury) wrote that she would be &#8220;embarrassed to be associated with it now&#8221; and she accepted that the University had failed me for the qualification.  The only examiner based outside Australasia wrote that he wanted there to be an oral defence.  The University of Waikato refused to schedule an oral examination or defence.  They updated my transcript to record that I was re-enrolled for extra time and then failed for the qualification.  The judiciary does not see anything wrong with this.  All the way up to the Supreme Court.  Well then, appoint Ashley Bloomfield Professor of Public Health.  He never applied to do a PhD.  Did not do the work for one.  Does not have any research output. </p>
