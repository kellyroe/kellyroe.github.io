		<h1> Current Work </h1>

		<p>I am unemployed, there is no work in progress.</p>

		<p>I was the last Philosophy research scholar the Australian National University had before they decided to close it down.  I wrote work for Martin Davies every week on the basis of readings he set me.  They'd be in his email inbox.  And then a talk that I wrote.  That was given to Andy Egan (his post-doctoral fellow).  Then I went back to the University of Waikato and they kept me enrolled for 2 years to do the 1 year Masters qualification.  As they do.  Not getting the work out to external examiners when they are supposed to.  I wrote 2 articles and a 50,000 word masters length thesis (it was required to be under 50,000 words so it would be unacceptable as a doctoral thesis even though 2 years is the minimum enrolment time on doctoral qualification).  They force everything to run over time because they get more and more and more and more money for keeping researh hostages slaves underpaid.
		</p>

		<p>Martin Davies and Andy Egan were paid how much to work on the ARC grant on delusions?  I think Daniel Stoljar claims to have been in on that, too. How much where they paid?  What research output do they have for their paid employment on that?  WHere is my credit or acknowlegement for the 2 research articles and 50,000 word book that I wrote on the subject.  What was my cut?  Where is my acknowlegement?  Where are my references?  Write me a reference? No?  Why not?  Close the programme down.  It's exploitative.</p> 

		<p>I return to the ANU Research SChool of Social Science Philsopohy Programme.  They shut the programme down.  They moved Sterelny from Wellington to Canberra so he could make a hostile work environment over there.</p>

		<p>They would not send the work that I did in my 3-4 years of doctoral enrolment out for external examination.  I don't know that anybody's work was ever sent out for external examination.  Nic Southwood said that Bob Goodin told him that externals had accepted his thesis without him having to make any changes to it.  But I don't think that sounds plausible. I would imagine they would feel like they hadn't done their job properly if they hadn't found so much as a typo.  One sentence to be altered.  One more reference to be added.  It just doesn't make any sense, at all.</p>

		<p>Nobody had a publically scheduled oral examination or defence.</p>

		<p>Then I get considerably less than post-doctoral fellowship or tenure-track employment wages for scraps of teaching and even scraps of research.  I meant to say I get paid considerably less than full time wages for less than full time work.  So now their narrative is that I don't have the capacity to work full time.  Because they won't pay me wages.</p>

		<p>Jeannette Kennett was paid how much to do teaching and research at Macquarie.  She subcontacted her stage 3 teaching to me.  How much did she pay me to do that, then?  She also paid me to do 120 hours of research.  She asked me to do a literature review for her on psychopathy.  I found 4 or 5 articles that I thought were high quality enough to form the basis of a philosophical theory article on the subject.  She told me not to worry about doing anything more on it.  That they were only saying they were employing me to do research because of how much they were underpaying me to do the teaching work.  Something about the money go round on her ARC research grant fellowship.  Then she tells everyone that I didn't do any research work for her.  That I didn't do the research work that she paid me to do.  No reference for me.  No further work for me in Australia.</p>

		<p>Brian Garrett and Jeremy Shearmer won't supply me with references for the tutoring work they paid me scraps to do.  They didn't pay me to attend their lectures.  They only paid me to do the tutorials.  Jeremy told me particularly and specifically that he didn't want me running the tutorials.  He wanted the students to sign up to running the tutorials in the first session and my job was to listen to them run the tutorials and grade them on how well they did the tutorials.  Then they tell everyone that I don't have the capacity or ability to run tutorials. Because they won't pay me.  </p>

		<p>Dave Chalmers says I should ask Dominic Murphy for a reference since I have a publication with him.  I suppose he means that he will never work with me since I have a publication with Dominic and I am associated with him.  </p>

		<p>Dave Chalmers had David Bourget enrolled as a doctoral student at the ANU.  NOt sure how since he'd already done a doctoral thesis for Toronto?  David Bourget was paid to make the Philsophers Index, right?  So Dave Chalmers give me an article from Tye and one from Dennett and I write `some thoughts on pain' and give the writing to him and give a seminar presentation...  And I get no written feedback on it at all.  He never asks me to write anything else.  He is my named supervisor and he has no instructions for me.  He doesn't tell me to read his work and write something on it.  He doesn't tell me to do anything at all.  He has no teaching.  He has less than a handful of doctoral studnets.  He does not meet with me.  He has no instructions for me.  They won't get my written work out for external examination.  They don't tellm e to supply them with work by any date.  </p>

		<p>I have put my work on my own webpage because they made Philosophers Index however many years ago and they never put my work up on it before.</p>

		<p>They were paid how much to supervise me?  What supervision did they offer to me?</p>

		<p>I was living at University HOuse in doctoral accommodation.  I left Australia in 2012.  That means I was there for 6 years.  I've done my time doing a 3-4 year doctoral degree and they had my 2 years of post-doctoral work.  They didn't even pay me post-doctoral wages for teaching and research that was done after the 3-4 years.  While they get me working in the kitchens to pay my rent.</p>

		<p>I hope everyone can understand why I'm not applying to move back to Australia for more temporary work.  I'm really not interested to move back to Australia at all.  If they offer me continuing employment...  I'm wondering how many of these people are over 65 but they are living their dream they still have functioning alumni email addresses etc etc that they use to tell everyone how garbage I am as to why they keep needing to be paid and paid and paid becuase there isnt' anybody else becuase everybody else was murdered off or bullied out of town.</p>

		<p>I have done my time with temporary work and I have been burned with it.  I'm not moving countries for temporary work.  What happens when you get to the end of the temporary work is they tell everyone that you are garbage to justify keeping the money for themselves only and replacing you with another temporary worker.  Like how Jeannette tells everyone that I didn't do 120 hours of work on psychopathy like she paid me to do.  Subcontracting her ARC grant on psychopathy to me.  LIke how Martin Davies threw me how much money, again, to write him 2 research articles and a 50,000 word book.  For no reference.  How much money did I get to do that, again?  How much was he paid?  Andy did enough work on it to get permanent hire at Rutgers.  Andy can't believe he's stupid.  Well, I can.  Old white man says.  Old white man says.  Old white man says.  Is Michel Smith still taking work out of Australia and passing it off as the output of Princeton?  Does nobody work on ethics since Peter Singer was old back when I was young and...  There really isn't anyting there. Hey.  Just stories about Kripke climbing trees to perve in the girls windows and how his graduate students were required to carry him to class.  Kinds of b*llshit... </p>

		<p>Ben Jeffares said that I've nearly burned all my bridges, or something.  But I can't help but think that the people who know me have only used their knowlege of me to exploit me.  I'm 45 years old and I've never been paid minimum wage for employment.  Griffiths would say it's about how when it's time for them to pay you you need to act like a wild pig.  So they can lock you up in teh psych ward and laugh about how much money they got for having you.</p>

		<p>There isn't anything there.  Hey.</p>

		<p>I wish I never met any of you.  My life is so much worse for my having met you.  Hahahahaha that Philosophers Index publishes 'dead certainty in the Cotard delusion' since I'm dead to you all. Why?  I guess because I was supposed to marry someone (be exclusive to only one old white guy and since Martin Davies left instead of acknowledging me or helping or reccomending employment for me) I'm only ever anybody else's sloppy seconds.  Everybody knows that Freud got to tell the world the function of girls.  It's to kill their mothers and have a male child for their father.  If it takes 6 times per week psychotherapy so the girls cite one and only one old white guy all f*cking day.</p>

		<p>Old white man says.  Old white man says.  Old white man says.</p>

		<p>They will pay me never.  When I'm dead.  Right?  Just call me ``Janet Frame''.  When it was time for them to pay her they locked her in an institution and paid some old white guy to keep her poorly so she could cry cry cry cry cry about how they keep her poorly all day.</p>

		<p>Who was writer in residence at the University of Otago at that time?  When Janet Frame was writing out of a psychiatric institution in New Zealand?  </p>

		<p>What has changed?  Nothing at all.  There is still no other way for women to be.</p>

		<p>Oh.  But Holly and Katrina.  Rachael.  THey all got paid.  Not me.  Hatha.  Well, Hatha was supposed to sleep with Richard Joyce, or something.  THat's why they moved him to Victoria University.  Right?  So that Hatha could keep giving him academic work that he could refuse to get out to externals.  Then Sterelny can make snide comments in `The Evolved Apprentice' about how cheap and easy Hatha was.  Make some snide comment about why would you share publication opportunities when you could keep them to yourself (about why would Dominic Murphy invite me to give him work so he can claim to be co-author with me -- who will want to work with me after I'm co-author with Dominic?  Why don't have have publication of my own research output as author sole?  Why do people have to have anything to do with Dominic if they have something to do with me? )  How many years did Hatha hand over her academic work before she was bullied into giving up and going away?  How many years did Dave Wall hand academic work over to Daniel Stoljar where Daniel wouldn't accept any of it until Dave was institutionalised.  They gave him glucose before vitamin so as to send him into a coma.  I guess if he died then Daniel could have kept all of his acdemic work for himself.  Publish it in his own name after he'd been killed off.</p>

		<p>Sydney University recently advertised a 2 year temporary position to do Dominic Murphy's first year teaching work.  What a f*cking b*llshit.  Is it dead yet?  It keeps telling me how good people don't get any work.  There's never been any work for his wife.  He gets paid more than enoguh to keep the whole harem and there is no money for anybody else.</p>

		<p>A doctoral thesis is 3-4 years.  Then, as Sterelny would say:  Your time budget is blown and it's time to pay your worker.</p>

		<p>What University?  There isn't anytthing there.  They've been taken over by mililtants.  That's what that means.  Right?  What else could that possibly mean?  Why was John Matthewson at the Philosophy doctoral programme?  He never even studied Philosophy as an undergraduate how could he have entry to the philosophy doctoral programme?  It was so hostile and competitive...  There's nothing there.</p>

		<p>  Hey maybe if you beat me a little harder in New Zealand that will make you even more of a winner.  I'm 45 years old and there's no work for me because Jeannette Kennett was paid how much by the Australian government to study psychopathy and she used that funding to tell everyone that I don't have any capacity to do research.</p>
		
		<p>She's over 65 and shes not on payroll apparently.  But she has university alumin email address that she can use to tell everyone how garbage I am.  Because she's a selfish b*tch who kept all the money for herself.  Psychopath.  Case study.</p>
