		<h1> Current Work </h1>

		<p>I am unemployed, there is no work in progress.</p>

		<p>Freud gave psychotherapy to his daughter.  6 sessions per week for years and years and years.  To try and have her come to the insight that normal psychology, for her, was to kill her mother and give Freud a male heir.  Apparently his male friends would pay him, to give psychotherapy to their daughters, too.  Just so as we can understand the function of psychiatry.  Who would pay to have psychoanalysis 6 sessions per week for years and years and years?  Who would pay to do that?  All voluntary-like? They have been `volunteered'?</p>

		<p>If you look at my academic output you see output of many many years.  Where is my acknowledgement for the work that I did?  Where is my acknowlegement for the work that I did on Martin Davies ARC funded project on delusions?  I reference Martin and the articlesl that he gave me to reference.  I did all of that appropriately -- yes?  I did everything he asked me to do.  Including delaying applying outside Australasia for PhD programme for more than a year so that there wouldn't be any conflict between my accepting an offer from Australasia and my obtaining an offer from outside Australasia.  I did that so as to do right by the ANU.  What did the ANU do to do right by me?</p>

		<p>I wrote the seminar `some thoughts on pain' and it was delivered to a workshop conference.  Dave Chalmers gave me no feedback on it, at all.  Not a `good good keep going'.  He had given me the Tye and Dennett article to write about.  He didn't give me anything more to write about.  He didn't ask to see any more of my writing.  He was named as a supervisor and person on my supervisory panel.  He didn't give me any written comments on any of my work or any further instructions.</p>

		<p>Kim Sterelny arrives to the ANU about 6 months after I start my doctoral thesis there.  He gave me Dominic Murphy's book as a pre-print manuscript.  So I'm writing about Dominics book and Paul Griffiths work that Daniel Stoljar reccommended I look into.  I write about them.  I listen to them speak.  THey don't provide any further instructions to me at all.  I write about them.  I write about them.  I write about them.  When do they acknowlege me and the work that I do?</p>

		<p>To the best of my knowlege NONE of the philosophy students at the ANU had their work go out for external examination.  None of them were required to update their thesis in response to reports from externals.  Various people tell me that it is your supervisors job to tell you when to get the hardcopy in by and to get it out to externals.  Nobody told me to get the ANU a  hardcopy.  I supplied a more than 100,000 word thesis document to Kim Sterelny (my named supervisor) when I was enrolled as a doctoral student.  He never gave me any written comments on that thesis.  Raised money to help me get out of Australia.  After I'd been there for 5-6 years.  I do all the work for them so they can have all of the money and not acknowlege me or my work output at all.</p>

		<p>They are editors etc of journals.  When are they going to get my work out for peer review?  If they need it from me in a format, or whatever, when are they going to give me instructions as to what it is that they need for me to do?</p>

		<p>To the best of my knowledge NONE of the philosophy students had publically scheduled oral examinations or defences.  NONE of them.  I never saw anybody have such a thing publically scheduled.  </p>

		<p>WHAT UNIVERSITY?  </p>

		<p>What University?  Seriously?  What University?</p>

		<p>They ignore my emails, now.  Kim Sterelny still has a functioning email address, does he?  But he is well over the age of 65 and it is time for him to get out.  Why don't I have an alumni email address?  I did tutoring work for Brian Garret and Jeremy Shearmer.  They won't write me references now.  Martin Davies won't write me a reference now.  They won't write me references for all  the work that I did.  It says considerably more about them than it does about me.  They are all over the age of 65 now.  Right?  It is well overdue time for them to get out.  </p>

		<p>Why do they pay various other people -- and not me?  Apparently I didn't *want* to be paid.  Wow.  What do you have to say to someone to get them to walk away all voluntary-like when it is time for them to be paid?  What University?  There is nothing there.  They won't pay the workers, hey.</p>

		<p>How did John Matthewson (or Oliver, or whatever his name is) get entry to do a PhD in Philosophy at the ANU when he never even applied to study Philosophy as an undergrad, and he never did study philosophy as an undergrad, to the best of my knowledge.  How could he possibly  be the most qualified person for the postion of philosophy lecturer at Massey, Albany?  He didn't even qualify for entry to the doctoral programme, did he?  How?</p>

		<p>Kim Sterelny wrote about how horribly hostile and competitive things were and the only function of women is to die after guys have had sex with them etc etc etc.  It was a horribly hostile workplace.  Where my work isn't acknowledged by him, at all.</p>

		<p>I think the best thing to do is not to reference anybody when they are alive.  If you pick out one person to riff off of (as I did with Dennett) then various other people get very very jealous and upset because there is some `he who gets most references wins' game.  Like this game where your job (if you can get away with calling it that) is to implant all the eggs with your sperm or perhaps take all the eggs out and replace them with a few of your eggs) your job is to have a great army of zombies citing from you and only you.  Whose your Daddy?  What is your philosophical lineage?  Everybody knows that normal philosophy is old white man says old white man says old white man says.  All day.  Thats teh only reason why the girls are voluneered for enrolment in the fine `tertiary institutions' of slave detention camp prison-land.</p>

		<p>When do they pay me?  I wrote 2 masters thesis and a doctoral thesis.  I have years of teachign experience.  When do they pay me?</p>

		<p>Apparently Ashley Bloomfield is Professor, now.  He never applied to be enrolled in the doctoral programme.  He never did the research work for one.  He doesn't have any teaching experience.</p>

		<p>What does it meeeeean for the institution to have been taken over by militants?  What could it possibly meeeeean???</p>
