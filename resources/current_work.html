		<h1> Current Work </h1>

		<p>I am unemployed, there is no work in progress.</p>

		<p>I moved to Australia to do a 3-4 year doctoral degree.  They would not get my work done, during that time, out for external examination.  
		</p>

		<p>I don't think that anybody had work go out for external examination.  Nobody had publically scheduled oral examinations or defences.</p>

		<p>I can supply my work history.  That shows that they did not pay me post-doctoral wages for scraps of teaching that they sub-contracted to me to do after the 3-4 year doctorate.  So that I could continue to pay my rent in doctoral student accommodation on campus.</p>

		<p>For example, Jeannette Kennett's stage 3 course.  That she paid me to do.  Not a post-doctoral fellowship because they won't pay me.  They'll pay her instead.  And she'll tell everything that I'm not good enough for post-doctoral wages so she can feel better about keeping all that money for herself.</p>

		<p>She will tell people that she paid me to do a literature review on psychopathy.  That when I gave her one page with a few high quality articles that could form the basis for a written article she told me not to do anything more on it.  That they only offered that to me to help make up for them underpaying me to do her stage 3 teaching.  She told me not to do anyting more on it.  Then she told everybody else that I didn't give her any writing when she had paid me to be her research assistant.  So that I wouldn't get paid by anybody else.  Why?  I suppose because I didn't give her her own articles.  I mean to say, I didn't put anything she wrote on the literature review that I have her.  Why?  Because I assumed she was aware of the work she had written.  She did not instruct me to read her work and write her something on that.  So that, you know, she could take it and give it someone already on payroll and they could claim that for themself.  Because, you know, why not take all of the money for yourself you selfish, f*cking b*itch.</p>

		<p>My bottom line is that I am not applying for anything that is no permanent / continuing.  I've done my time with the temporary.  The trouble with the temporary is that they will simply replace you with new temporary and tell tales about you to try and justify why they won't pay you continuing.  </p>

		<p>I mean to say, suppose I move to a new country for a 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 of 5 or 6 year position.  I can't take that money to the bank and purchase securities or futures.  I can't use it to obtain a mortgage so that I have housing security.  So they get all of the money back on rent.  Who does?  The ``university'' I suppose.  Salary or wage diversion, effectively.  Why not just keep me in ``university house'' doctoral student accommodation.  Put me into position where I can sh*t (or worse) in the VC's food.  That's a great idea.  Why would they trust me?  That doesn't make any sense.  Well, then, time to deport the over-stayer.</p>

		<p>Just send it back to New Zealand.  Because there isn't any paid employment there.  Hahahahaha!  That'll teach her!!!</p>

		<p>Teach me what, exactly?  To get in behind someone else?  I did that already.  I will never read anything that Martin Davies writes ever again.  I will never reference anything that he says ever again.  You are welcome.  Thanks for nothing.   Close the summer research scholarship programme down because it is exploitative.  Wouldn't you say?  Close down the RSSS Philsophy programme.  There is nothing there, hey.  What was John Matthewson doing pretending to be a doctoral philosophy studnet?  He never studied philosophy as an undergraduate.  I guess he wanted to hang out with the cool kids...  Claim to be author of philsophy publications, now...  What the hell.  Seriously...</p>

		<p>I was in Australia for 6 years.  THat is a 3 year doctoral and 2 year temporary post-doctoral length of time.  They underpaid me and it was a hostile work environment.  Obviously.  That's what Sterelny was re-deployed to do.  Right?  </p>

		<p>That's enough information to have about a fit for a continuing position.  That doesn't mean you can't apply somewhere else for a better fit.  But then if the fit isn't good the employer has incentive to help the employee move on to a better one.  By providing references and the like.</p>

		<p>When the temporary positions come to the end of their fixed term...  What incentive is there for the temporary employer to provide references?  Where are my references from the ANU?  WHere is my reference from Martin Davies?  At the end of my fixed term position as his summer research scholar where is my reference from him?  What incentive is there for him to write me a reference?  WHere is my reference from Dave Chalmers for having written `some thoguhts on pain' in response to the 2 articles he gave me?  He never gave me written comments on it or any further instructions.  I mean to say I did everything he asked me to do and he never instructed me to do anything again.  And he doesn't have to be accountable for that because he can just tell everyone that I'm garbage now, or whatever.  I will never read anyting that he writes or reference him ever again.  I'm dead to him.  Because he didn't feel I referenced him enough before.  My job was to fawn over him.  Old white man says.  Old white man says.  Old white man says.  No doubt.  I did everything he asked me to do.  He was paid how much, again, to be my supervisor.  He had no teaching.  How many studnets was he supervising?  They don't get to accuse me of not having a work capacity.  How much was he paid, again?  </p>
