		<h1> Current Work </h1>

		<p>I am unemployed, there is no work in progress.</p>

		<p>Freud gave psychotherapy to his daughter.  6 sessions per week for years and years and years.  To try and have her come to the insight that normal psychology, for her, was to kill her mother and give Freud a male heir.  Apparently his male friends would pay him, to give psychotherapy to their daughters, too.  Just so as we can understand the function of psychiatry.  Who would pay to have psychoanalysis 6 sessions per week for years and years and years?  Who would pay to do that?  All voluntary-like? They have been `volunteered'?</p>

		<p>If you look at my academic output you see output of many many years.  Where is my acknowledgement for the work that I did?  Where is my acknowlegement for the work that I did on Martin Davies ARC funded project on delusions?  I reference Martin and the articlesl that he gave me to reference.  I did all of that appropriately -- yes?  I did everything he asked me to do.  Including delaying applying outside Australasia for PhD programme for more than a year so that there wouldn't be any conflict between my accepting an offer from Australasia and my obtaining an offer from outside Australasia.  I did that so as to do right by the ANU.  What did the ANU do to do right by me?</p>

		<p>I wrote the seminar `some thoughts on pain' and it was delivered to a workshop conference.  Dave Chalmers gave me no feedback on it, at all.  Not a `good good keep going'.  He had given me the Tye and Dennett article to write about.  He didn't give me anything more to write about.  He didn't ask to see any more of my writing.  He was named as a supervisor and person on my supervisory panel.  He didn't give me any written comments on any of my work or any further instructions.</p>

		<p>Kim Sterelny arrives to the ANU about 6 months after I start my doctoral thesis there.  He gave me Dominic Murphy's book as a pre-print manuscript.  So I'm writing about Dominics book and Paul Griffiths work that Daniel Stoljar reccommended I look into.  I write about them.  I listen to them speak.  THey don't provide any further instructions to me at all.  I write about them.  I write about them.  I write about them.  When do they acknowlege me and the work that I do?</p>

		<p>To the best of my knowlege NONE of the philosophy students at the ANU had their work go out for external examination.  None of them were required to update their thesis in response to reports from externals.  Various people tell me that it is your supervisors job to tell you when to get the hardcopy in by and to get it out to externals.  Nobody told me to get the ANU a  hardcopy.  I supplied a more than 100,000 word thesis document to Kim Sterelny (my named supervisor) when I was enrolled as a doctoral student.  He never gave me any written comments on that thesis.  Raised money to help me get out of Australia.  After I'd been there for 5-6 years.  I do all the work for them so they can have all of the money and not acknowlege me or my work output at all.</p>

		<p>They are editors etc of journals.  When are they going to get my work out for peer review?  If they need it from me in a format, or whatever, when are they going to give me instructions as to what it is that they need for me to do?</p>

		<p>To the best of my knowledge NONE of the philosophy students had publically scheduled oral examinations or defences.  NONE of them.  I never saw anybody have such a thing publically scheduled.  </p>

		<p>WHAT UNIVERSITY?  </p>

		<p>What University?  Seriously?  What University?</p>

		<p>They ignore my emails, now.  Kim Sterelny still has a functioning email address, does he?  But he is well over the age of 65 and it is time for him to get out.  Why don't I have an alumni email address?  I did tutoring work for Brian Garret and Jeremy Shearmer.  They won't write me references now.  Martin Davies won't write me a reference now.  They won't write me references for all  the work that I did.  It says considerably more about them than it does about me.  They are all over the age of 65 now.  Right?  It is well overdue time for them to get out.  </p>

		<p>Why do they pay various other people -- and not me?  Apparently I didn't *want* to be paid.  Wow.  What do you have to say to someone to get them to walk away all voluntary-like when it is time for them to be paid?  What University?  There is nothing there.  They won't pay the workers, hey.</p>

		<p>How did John Matthewson (or Oliver, or whatever his name is) get entry to do a PhD in Philosophy at the ANU when he never even applied to study Philosophy as an undergrad, and he never did study philosophy as an undergrad, to the best of my knowledge.  How could he possibly  be the most qualified person for the postion of philosophy lecturer at Massey, Albany?  He didn't even qualify for entry to the doctoral programme, did he?  How?</p>

		<p>Kim Sterelny wrote about how horribly hostile and competitive things were and the only function of women is to die after guys have had sex with them etc etc etc.  It was a horribly hostile workplace.  Where my work isn't acknowledged by him, at all.</p>

		<p>I think the best thing to do is not to reference anybody when they are alive.  If you pick out one person to riff off of (as I did with Dennett) then various other people get very very jealous and upset because there is some `he who gets most references wins' game.  Like this game where your job (if you can get away with calling it that) is to implant all the eggs with your sperm or perhaps take all the eggs out and replace them with a few of your eggs) your job is to have a great army of zombies citing from you and only you.  Whose your Daddy?  What is your philosophical lineage?  Everybody knows that normal philosophy is old white man says old white man says old white man says.  All day.  Thats teh only reason why the girls are voluneered for enrolment in the fine `tertiary institutions' of slave detention camp prison-land.</p>

		<p>When do they pay me?  I wrote 2 masters thesis and a doctoral thesis.  I have years of teachign experience.  When do they pay me?</p>

		<p>Apparently Ashley Bloomfield is Professor, now.  He never applied to be enrolled in the doctoral programme.  He never did the research work for one.  He doesn't have any teaching experience.</p>

		<p>What does it meeeeean for the institution to have been taken over by militants?  What could it possibly meeeeean???</p>

		<p>Turns out you don't have to pay people to take control of the ``medications'' whereby the girls forget what happened to them over the last whatever space of time.  No shortage of people wanting to get in there and have a go at that one.  YOu don't have to pay people to play doctors and nurses.  No shortage of unpaid student volunteers willing to work that job while more and more and more debt against their name is recorded with the ``university''.  To ``work'' in the ``hospital''.  In fact you don't need to pay ``teachers'' to ``work'' in the ``schools''.  In fact you could just really serve the function of mopping up the proceeds of crime that leaks out of other parts of the world.  I mean to say money can't buy securites or futures.  There is no security and there's certainly no future.</p>

		<p>No need to immortalise are they dead yet?  Thanks for nothing.  I see why they pay you.</p>

		<p>The entire time I was at the ANU I was living at University House.  That's where visiting academics can pay and pay and pay to stay in hotel rooms there and pay and pay and pay to socialise with the graduate students.  They put me to work in hospitality so I could pay my rent as an over-stayer.  Because Sterelny and Chalmer's etc wouldn't get my work out to external examiners.  Chortle chortle snort about what I was going to do with myself, then.  Karen lived out the back of Marjan's house, in a shed, there, or similar.  When her doctoral scholarship funding ran out but they wouldn't get her work out for external examination.  Various others were working out of their parents houses or similar.  Working.  What work?  THey aren't paid to do it.  SUpervisors and the department are paid and paid and paid and paid and paid for the ``students'' to be re re re re re re re enrolled.</p>

		<p>But their work never went out for external examination at all.  Did it?  They never had publically scheduled oral examinations, or defences.  So how is it that various people are claiming to be post-doctoral. To have completed doctoral qualifications...  But they don't think I've done enough for one.  They think they were tortured more than me, or something, that I'm not deserving?  I genuinely honestly do not understand.  Why don't they acknowlege me to be a graduate of the University?  What did others do that I didn't?  </p>

		<p>  Martin Davies told me that he wasn't going to be staying at the ANU and I should leave it open who was to be my supervisor and just fit in with whatever.  So that is what I tried to do.  But now the old white guys (after it's time for them to get out) treat me like I"m everybody else's sloppy seconds.  I didn't realise my job was to pick one and only one old white guy to reference.  </p>

		<p>Why does my first publication need to have someone elses name on it?  Was I incapable of working independently?  I didn't have an article length work of my own that coud be published so that people could see what they would be getting if they hired me?</p>

		<p>Dominic Murphy's sloppy seconds.  All the people who wouldn't hire him -- now they won't hire me?  Is that the idea?  Is that the ideology?  SO that Sydney University can advertise (about 20 years too late) a post-doctoral sort of a scrappy position of sub-constracted Dominic's first year teaching work.  That he hasn't updated in the last couple decades that he's been payrolled.  Ooooooh.  Most desirable job ever.  I see why all the trophy daughters are killing each other over being signed up for that Degree. </p>

		<p>Did John walk into his Father's job at Cornell after his father died?  Did he find himself a trophy wife?  Is she happier than his mother was?  Do you wonder why?</p>

		<p>I applied to Cornell to be enrolled in the doctoral programme.  They did not send me a letter to decline the application.  When I made an inquiry Tamar Gendler emailed me (I named her as potential supervisor) to say she had moved to Harvard.  So I'm supposed to want to go to Harvard, to follow her.  She can me my Mommy.  I'll just reference her all day.  For decades and decades and decades so that they can never pay me.  That sounds like a great job for.  Hey, maybe I can just marry JOhn and hand over all my academic output to him.  Then he can cross out my name, put his name on it instead, and tell me that I'm doing it for a better life for our children.  Because my life never was allowed to be, at all, I was just supposed to make baby boys or girls who would take my place so I didn't have to be his little bitch anymore.  It's soooooo appealing.  I see why alll the little boys and girls want to work sooooo hard to hand over all the work do all the work all of the work and none of hte credit.  </p>

		<p>WHERE IS MY DEGREE?  WHERE IS MY JOB??? All these over 65 year old guys who won't get out.  Get out.  Get the f*ck out.  Time to go.  There will be a job for me only over their dead bodies, they say.  So all i get to say all f*cking day is 'is it f*cking well dead, yet?  Hurry up and die.'</p>

		<p>Hey, you are welcome.  You can pay me later.  Let me reference Paul Griffith's here on how it's time for htem to pay me so I havee to behave like a wild pig and convince them that I only want the money to take a wife.  Same as them.  Else to be paid and paid and paid to take the work of my students...  And hand it over to various people on payroll to knock the next generation out.  I can only suppose.  How many students does ``Dennett's'' name, in publication, represent?  How many people were bullied into handing their work over to him so they could be failed out or married of or whatever whatever whatever.  So he can cross out their name and write his own  name on it and pretend to be more productive than anybody else.  All of the references for him.  All of the research outputs for him.  Nobody else ever outputted any work worth paying them for.  Clearly.  </p>

		<p>So, much as I'd love to reference you Patrick, and listen to another one of your talks...  HOw many decades of listening to them speak do I have to do before they listen to me speak for a change?  Where is my credit?  How many times do I have to go on and on and on to convince them that I undersetand what they are saying before they bother to show me the same courtesy?  There is nothing there.  Hey.</p>

		<p>They closed the RSSS down instead of crediting me.  THey stopped the summer scholarship programme after I did that.  University of North Carolina stopped taking an ANU student for a year.  Closed it down.  Gone.  NOthing there.  What Philosophy in Australia?  I guess you will have to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay to go to Princeton or Rutgers or Tufts or Harvard...  If you want to hear the research output of Australasia.  Taken from the people who do the work there and teleprompted from the people on their payroll.  There is nothing there.  Hey.  Peter Godfrey Smith must be about the same age as Kim Sterelny.  Photos of them at Sydney together.  So it's time for him to get out then, as well.  Time to go.  Over 65.  Give someone else a turn.  Ffs.  Nobody wants to sit around singing your praises all and every day.  Old white man says.  Old white man says.  Old white man says.  Old white man says.</p> 

		<p>Nobody else applied to be enrolled in Psychiatry.  Professor Glue has a theory of what the teenage girls need from psychiatry.  No surprises that it is really nothing new.  Old white man says.  Old white man says.  Old white man says.  How is the uterine relocation going, Professor Glue?  HOw are they taking to those surgical anasthetics?  Great that they have been signed up all voluntary-like, they have been volunteered.  So that you can tell them all your theory of what makes their life meaningful.  Otherwise they will consent to die, now that it is time to listen to them for a change instead of the world listening to you.  Old white man says old white man says old white man has something to say about the funciton of the girls.  Of course he does.  He would really have things no other way.  There really aren't any people here.  Hey.</p>

		<p>Khan Acadmey says that 6-9 months of frictional unemployment.  I have never been paid to work full-time.  I got a doctoral scholarship for 3-4 years of doctoral work and the slavers that were paid and paid and paid and paid and paid to process my doctoral work..  Had no instructions for me.  WOuldn't get my work out.  No surprises there.  Where are my references, then for the work that I did?  The teaching work that I did for the ANU?  Jeannette Kennett wants to say that she offered me her teaching work and I was paid about $5,000 to do it (so I could pay my rent to university house) but I can't do research because I didn't give her a literature review on psychopathy.</p>

		<p>YOu see, I wanted to help people.  SO they wanted me to write about how I could helpl psychopaths, such as themselves.  That is why everybody wants to be a hollywood psychiatrist -- right?  To deal with hollywood psychopaths.  The psycihatrist gets to be the head psychopath -- right?  That's how come we don't have any moral problems with them taking them out.  I don't mean being anesthetised by Dr Glue taking them out.  I mean something different entirely.  Don't forget to pay and pay and pay and pay for your visa to NZ or Australia to be processed.  SO you can pay and pay and pay and pay and pay to be re re re re re enrolled in their ``educational institutions''.  SO they can refuse to acnowledge the work that you have done.  So they can provide to you a hostile workplace.  A hostile environment.  One where various people are paid and paid and paid to eliminate you.  Unless, of course, you want to sing and sing and sing and sing and sing their praises all day.</p>

		<p>It is a funny story...  Actually more interesting...  That various people..  Vice Chancellor's, and the like, would think that working at University House in the kitchens was an appropriate job for me.  That they would give me enough doing that to pay my rent but no more academic work for me.  THey would trust me to feed them.  To give them things they would eat.  THey trusted me not to shit in it.  Or worse.  Kim Sterelny trusted me to look after his house and his cats while he went away on holiday.  He didn't leave his cats any catfood.  I had to pay for that myself.  Either he didn't care if I killed his cats else he trusted me.  Did he eat the food that was in his fridge and so on when he came back?  Did he trust me not to shit in it, or worse?</p>

		<p>Now, why on earth would he do a thing like that, do you suppose?</p>

		<p>Well that makes me an idiot.  Just puttin gthis out there on the public record so future students or potential students can make informed decisions about how they life their lives.  It being soooo hostile and soooo comeptitive adn alll.  Don't forget to have babies so their fathers can teach them to kill you off since your function as a female has been fulfilled and all.  And don't forget to reference one and only one old white guy so he can declare himself to be winner in teh stupid citation game that has taken the place of academics.  There's nothing there. Old white guy says old white guy says what old what old white guy says is indistinguisable from a computer output so you don't need to worry becuase nobody needs to get paid at all.  There's actually nothing there. Old white guy has decided.  Hey.   </p>

		<p>More than 12 months frictional umployment.  I started my doctoral thesis in 2006.  3-4 years of doctoral scholarship and then they are supposed to pay me post-doctoral wages.  They won't do it.  WHen it is time for them to pay you they won't do it.  Why work hard in school?  Why do what they say?  Look at me.  I worked hard at school.  I did what they said.  THey won't pay me.  There is nothing there.</p>

		<p>Hahhahahahhaha what are you going to do about it?  YOu and whose army?</p>

		<p>There is nothing there</p>

		<p>If they put up an electric fence, in Auckalnd central, with enough volts to kill a person...  How many people do you think would take a run, at at?  We are supposed to believe that various people are living their dreams out in the breeding colony housing of the suburbs...  How many would take a run at it, do you suppose?  You know, if transportion wasn't prohibitive.</p>

		<p>I can tell you the value of a NZ education, by the way.  The NZ government is pretty clear about it.  Your student loan only ever appreciates in value.  I mean to say you owe more and more and more over time.  Whereas the amount of money they will pay you later for having chosen to invest in your education in the first place.  Well, the qualifications are value-less.  Meaning-less.  Ashley Bloomfield is appointed to position as professor when he never even applied to be enrolled in a PhD or MD research doctoral qualification.  That is or means to say the value of a PhD or MD research doctoral qualification is worthless.  Meaningless.  THey will appoint people to be professor without doctoral qualification.  Doctoral qualification is dis-qualification.  It's a scummy scam of a hoax of a farce.  It doesn't mean anything when they won't give it to people who did the work for it and they hand it out all honorary-like to the likes of Jacinda because she's going to write a book one day, or maybe make a movie.  It's a f*cking joke.</p>

		<p>So I have studnet loan for qualifications that the NZ government thinks are meaningless.  Sterelny says that 5 years post-graduation they don't mean anything.  Well, I'm waiting for my letter from the government to say that I don't owe them anything for the fees and so on.  Because it wasn't an education system at all and there's nothing there in fact.  Anti-intellectual.  NZ always was known as that.  Doesn't acknowlege the value of an education because they won't pay people to work that job.  Why pay someone to do it when they can get a second year student to play at it while recording more and more debt against their name only.  It just doesn't make any sense.</p>

		<p>Who in the Philosophy programme at University of Auckland is under the age of 65?   Brett Calcott's wife.  Brett did the IT infrastructre so that people would send Phil Bio journal their work -- right?  Then they could look into them and see who was already on payroll.  Then delay and detain work from people not on payroll yet.  5 years later (once they had been run out of town) they could declare it abandonware and reattribute authorship to someone else.  Someone already on payroll.  ALl the studnets work can go into turnitin so the particularly stupid people who pay and pay and pay and pay princeton etc can purchase an essay for them to be credited as author of, from the internet.  Or similar.  SO the kids enrolled at Penn can see their name in print and be good little trophy kids and do their parents proud.  Or some such b*llshit.  It's okay.  You can just pay me later.  Publish me never.  F*ck you.  F*ck you very much.  HOw did Brett ever get to be enrolled in a philosophy PhD.  He never studied philosophy as an undergraduate -- did he?  He never sounded like he'd studied first year philosophy of mind, or anything...</p>
