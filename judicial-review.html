                            I am aware that you aren't supposed to comment on cases while they are working their way through the courts but how long is reasonable to wait for justice?  I have uploaded various pieces of evidence over on the writing tab.

                            The Universities of New Zealand seem to think that they have the power to decide whether or not to give a student their Degree on the basis of whether they like what the student has to say or whether they don't like it.  They think they are not required to allow students to work to international standards of academic scholarship at all.  They believe they are entitlted to circumvent the external examination process and refuse to get work to externals in order to prevent and prohibit timely completion of graduate research qualifications.

                            The supreme court requires me to pay more than $7,000 security for costs for the case to be heard on appeal otherwise the court of appeal will not book a date for the hearing.  Perhaps the court thinks that justice looks like crowd-funding a trial?

                            My complaint about the NZVCC is that they are not progressing complaints from students (former studnets) or staff (former staff).  They refused to progress my complaint about the University of Waikato mis-handling my thesis submissions and demanding I pay them a bribe by demanding I re-enrol in the MPhil and pay them more fees otherwise I would never receive the qualification.  

                            The NZVCC has statutory function to uphold the quality and integrity of NZ University qualifications.  But they are not progressing complaints.  So the people responsible for not progressing complaints need to be removed from office.  Else, what is supposed to happen?  Every student with a complaint is supposed to pay the courts thousands upon thousands upon thousands of dollars for access to justice through the courts?

                                The issue here is that the University of Auckland informed me that that my application to MBChB was unsuccessful on the grounds that my rank order score was not high enough for me to be offered a place.  When I queried that it turned out they miscalculated my GPA.  <br>
                                
                                Instead of them apologising for their mistake and recalculating my rank order score they informed me that it didn't matter what my rank order score was because I was ineligible to have applied anyway.<br>

                                I learned that The Education Act says that domestic adults are eligible to be enrolled in the programme they applied to, however.  Therefore the University was wrong to have advised me that I was required to undertake further study in order to become eligible.  I would not have enrolled in the MPhil or written that thesis except that the Univesity told me they required me to complete a new programme of study in order to become eligible and I believed what they told me because I thought it was their job to help me.<br>

                                Then the University of Waikato did everything they could to prevent and prohibit the timely completion of my Degree.  They tried to force things to run over-time so that Auckland could say I was ineliglible because I was a slow worker.<br>

                                They did everything they could to set me up to fail in other words.  Which is not just.  Which is not fair.  I did everything they asked of me and they had already made up their minds in advance that they were never going to select me.  <br>
                                
                                But I learned the Education Act says that I was eligible to apply.  So they were required to apply their selection algorithm to my application and offer me a place (or not) on the basis of my rank order score.  I did not (in 2018 or 2019) as for any special consideration at all.  I asked them only to apply their published selection algorithm to my application and no exclude me on the grounds of disability.  My rank order score likely was high enough for a place.  That is what makes the best sense of their refusal to apply their selection algorithm to my application.<br>

                                I only previously enrolled in Health Science because they said that was what I needed to do to become eligible.  I trusted them.  I did speak with people from the disability office and they suggested to me that I take all accommodations that I was eligible for and that I write a letter to all my lecturers and explain I was a disability candidate.  I said I did not feel very comfortable taking disability accommodations because I never had accommodations for disability before and I wasn't even sure if I needed them.  They said I was entitled in virtue of my dx, however, and encouraged me to take them.  I did what they suggested I do and they set me up to fail only.  The University failed me for Population Health which forced me to withdraw from the Univeristy to preserve my full time GPA.  They set me up to fail only.<br>

                                They did everything they could to set me up to fail and to fail me.  But they were required by law to apply their selection algorithm to my application.  And they refuse to do this.  And the courts are now refusing to order them to do this.  That is to say the courts refuse to enforce rule of or rule by law.<br>

                                They are trying to force it to be about disability because of their own agenda.  They are disabling, in other words.  Because they think they can force it to be about disability they will force it to be about disability.  It is not about equity or justice (where disability is not relevant).  It has to be about getting away with their disabling people.<br>

They stated that I was ineligible to apply and they refused to consider my application on it's merits on the grounds that they had already made up their minds that they did not choose me.

                                Again, I have asked if there is any further avenue for justice in NZ or if I need to look overseas.
                                </li>

                                I presented to the hospital with a medical complaint.  They held me unlawfully for more than 6 hours without filling out the paperwork that was required for me to be held lawfully and without giving me access to a lawyer.  They filled out paperwork to detain me for psychiatric observation for 5 days and then proceeded to hold me involuntariliy for 7 days.  They write in my notes they are detaining me 'involuntarily'.  There are no medication notes for me and no pharmacy dispensary notes for me but the nursing notes say I only agreed to take oral medication after I was taken into a seclusion room by a group of staff and threatened with injection.<br>

                                The ADHB chose to file a motion to have the proceedings struck out in their entirety.  There was a 2 hour hearing and the court found that there did seem to be grounds to further progress the complaint and that the proceedings would not be struck out.  Costs were awarded against Ms Roe, however.  That is to say that Ms Roe was expected to pay the costs of the ADHB having chosen to file to have the proceedings struck out.<br>

                                There does not seem to be precedent for costs to be awarded to a self respresented applicant or litigant.  That is to say costs will only be awarded against a self represented applicant or litigant from the courts.  That is to say there is no justice to be found in the courts of New Zealand who will only award costs against a self represented applicant.  <br>

                                That is to say if the government (or a government agency or department like the ADHB or one of the public universities of the NZVCC) chooses to act ultra vires then the person who pays for that is the victim only.<br>

                                I cannot really see how the courts are doing anything other than demanding the victims pay bribes to the courts, effectively compounding injustice only.  New Zealand seem to be rule by mob.   <br>
                                
                                Other countries are finding roughly 25 per cent of their people are opposed to mandates.  New Zealand denies there are roughly 25 percent of the people opposed to mandates.  It somehow thinks it is an aspirational ideal to have none of the people or only 5 per cent of the people opposed to involuntary medical treatment mandates.  <br>
                                
                                I am not allowed to contribute to the solution of messy problems in New Zealand because people want to punish me for raising or talking about problems.  I am not allowed to contribute to solutions within the system because the system will to ultra vires to exlude me.  This country makes no sense.<br>

                                We refuse to process applications to enrol, we refuse to process students work, we refuse to process qualification completions, we refuse to publically advertise jobs, we refuse to hire the most meritious candiate for jobs, we refuse to allow things to be about merit.  Things are always about people acting ultra vires getting away with making terrible decisions for all the wrong reasons preventing and prohibiting and obstructing and denying and refusing to allow New Zealand to produce anything or to develop.  We are expected to sit around singing the praises of too many chiefs all freaking day while they force people to comply with their demands only.  If you protest this treatment you must be mentally disabled.  You must lack the cognitive capcity.  You must be isolated from all your frienemies and excluded you lose the great competitition hierarchy of being.<br>

                                There are more people wanting psychiatric assistance than we are able to assist.  Because the people on payroll for psychiatry are too busy forcing 'treatment' in the involuntary.  Only treat the involuntary.  That seems to be the Kiwi way.  Most compliant most forced least free population in the developed world.  Not developed, really.  Not developing.  Why work to developing 3 year degrees into 4 year degrees or 3 year degrees into 5 year degrees when you can force a 3 year degree to take twice as long or force students to work half as fast?   Why work to graduate entry professional degrees? <br>

                                Nothing is allowed to grow or develop, here.  Stagnant.  Stagnating.  Well, just murder them all off, then, better luck next generation.<br>

                                I don't see any justice, here.  The people are not allowed access to healthcare.  The leaders will not allow informed consent.  People can spout the party line of what the government has decided is best for you only.  New Zealand is not developing.  People are not allowed to contribute to the development of New Zealand.<br>

                                Well fail me for having 'unpopular' views, then.  Detain me on disability or give me my euthanasia drugs when my supported living life support payments are due to expire in 6 months.  Find some doctors to voluntarily comply wit signing the papers to have me murdered off all voluntarily involutarily take one for the team-like.  I do not see any justice here.<br>

                                If I disappear you will know I was murdered at the hands of the state.<br>

                                I mean, what is supposed to happen, here?  What happened in Ireland with only one variety of potato?  How good is it that there be only one variety of banana?  We don't know the long-term effects of vaccination.  We do know that typically vaccine induced immunity is not superior to naturally induced immunity.  We do not know the longer term effects of vaccination.  And, in the face of that, different people want to do different things.  And if only the governments would step off and allow it there would  be genuine variation and diversity and robustness in the popluation.  So if we find that there are harmful effects of a batch or more than a batch or one variety or all of the varieties then there is some insurance or mitigation on our mistake.  Why do people have to force everyone to be the same and do what they say because they say when they say.  It makes no sense.  What is supposed to happen here?  Every 6 months the people get their new injection from the government?  Is that life, now?  Every 6 months a new shot in the arm mandated by the government in the name of medical treatment or medical care?  The decision to have a vaccine or not has NOTHING to do with whether one is opposed to mandate or not.  The moral development and ethical development of our leaders approaches zero.  THEY WILL NOT LISTEN.<br>

                                I am so NOT INTERESTED in politics.  But the political leaders will not step off and allow their people to function.  We do have war in New Zealand.  It's a cold war.  People are getting pretty good at lying to other people's faces.  The government is training the population to be psychopaths.

                                <br>  People will forge documents and lie because that's what the government requires of them.  Criminalises them.  Builds a statute to remind the kids from Carrington what will happen to them if they don't do what the government says when the government says  because the government says.  The Medical Schools of NZ choose Dr Leeks.  The Medical Schools of NZ chose Dr Green.  Those to close ranks around and about them and people like them and enable them and cover for them.  I don't give a crap that they do not choose me when they choose them.  The issue is that they are required to train me.
