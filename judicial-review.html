                            <p>
                            The first adjudicator found in my favor.  I was then informed that that judgment was to be thrown out and a re-hearing was granted on grounds that new evidence was going to be entered in.  The second adjudicator found in my favor.  The 'evidence' that was entered in was not evidence that an electrician had approved the hard-wiring of an electrical applicance contrary to manufacturers installation instructions. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I was informed that the second judgment, also, was to be thrown out and a re-re-hearing was granted on grounds that there was new evidence.  No new evidence was supplied.  The third adjudicator found against me and ordered suppression even though nobody had applied for suppression and I had no opportunity to oppose suppression.  I cannot see any reason to grant suppression (e.g., to protect vulnerable people).  The purpose of court suppression orders is not to hide or conceal that the courts are refusing to uphold the laws.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I appealed the judgment of the third adjudicator and the judgement was upheld in the District Court.  The effect of this is to set precedent (except suppression again was applied by the court) that landlords do not need electricians to sign off on hard-wired electrics in properties that are rented.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I suppose it is an act of civil disobedience for me to be making public the two judgments against me that were ordered 'supressed' by the courts of New Zealand.  The courts of New Zealand do not seem to understand the purpose of suppression.  The courts of New Zealand do not appear willing and / or able to uphold the laws of New Zealand.  Would you like to do business, with New Zealand?
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I am, obviously, concerned about the ADHB having chosen to involuntarily detain me in conditions of torture when I presented to the ED with physical complaint that they refused to address because they preferred to unlawfully detain me in the name of psychiatry.  They say that I was to be detained under the mental health act with 'voluntary' status.  They noted that I wanted to leave but was required to say (was locked in, not allowed to leave without an escort to ensure I returned) and that I was there 'voluntarily' as I was required to be.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            This is not a health system.  This is an unlawful detention camp.  This is not the developed world.  The courts refuse to uphold the law.  Maybe because the Universities refuse to graduate anybody willing and or able to uphold the law.  I don't know what to say.
                            </p>

                                The courts are abusive.

                                Though ignorance or malevolence or some combination of both the New Zealand courts do not follow best international practices when it comes to how Judges and Lawyers interact with and treat people who are before the courts claiming to have been harmed.

                                I asked for help with my filings.

                                Ailsa Claire in her capacity as CE of the ADHB chose to hire a QC to file to have my proceedings thrown out without a substantive hearing.  She chose to do this rather than choosing to work with me to ensure that what happened to me does not happen to anybody else presenting for treatment from the ADHB.

                                The Judge berates me for the quality of my filings.  Refuses to appoint an amicus.  Refuses to appoint a Legal Aid Lawyer.  Does not schedule a substantive hearing of the issue.  Does not uphold my interlocutory (or costs involved in my having filed it).  Does not uphold the motion to have proceedings struck out -- but required me to pay the costs involved in the hearing of that matter...  A decision that was upheld by the Supreme Court.

                                I get invoices, now, from the ADHB saying I ower them more than $5,000 for the costs involved in their having a QC file motion to have my proceedings struck out.

                                It isn't really safe for tourists to come here.  A volcano could explode (like White Island) and then there won't be skin for grafting, there won't be nurses for burn care.  They will find themselves bathed by random strangers who claim them as 'family'.  There doesn't appear to be anything here...

                                The Judiciary will not uphold the laws of New Zealand.  The point of the Independence of the Judiciary is to grant them the freedom to uphold the law.  They are not upholding the law.  So they don't get independence.  The Universities are not upholding the academic freedoms of the faculty and students.  So they don't get to be independent.  Criminalising me for their crimes is not really something that motivates and inspires people to want to do business with New Zealand.  I don't see how anybody can do business with New Zealand.  That thing we like to call business that results in wrongful deaths, sure.  Dolphins in the tuna.  Melamine in the infant formula.  Round-up in the honey.

                                Don't worry about the state of Psychiatry.  Apparently, in New Zealand, it's restricted to only the very most deprived.  The 5 per cent of the drug abusing mentally ill people who need their children to be taken away and given, or sold, to someone else.

                                I have  been trying to understand why the courts refuse to extradite kim.com so that he can stand trial in the US courts for the content of megauploads.  The courts instruct re-hearing and re-hearing and allow more and more filings.  He seems to pay the New Zealand Courts.  I wonder what the contents are that the Judiciary of NZ is not wanting to be shown or displayed to the US courts.

                                I suppose it isn't surprising when the Law 'Profession' chooses to go after the most junior partner (and the only Pacifica person in the firm by the looks of it) for sexual harrassment / abuse of interns rather than going after the most senior white people for whom he was likely playing wing-man so they could see who, more properly, to target.

                                Some people read 'to Kill a Mockingbird' for which they must be punished and exluded to make way for people who like to put on a fancy suit and bully and harrass and prevent and prohibit justice from being upheld in the name of the Legal Profession.  There doesn't seem to be anythere here...
