                            <p>
                            I suppose it is an act of civil disobedience for me to be making public the two judgments against me that were ordered 'supressed' by the courts of New Zealand.  I have made the executive decision to make the judgments publically available, however, for the following reason:  Supression, in this instance, does not help vulnerable people.  Supression, in this instance, serves to conceal that the courts failed to uphold justice.  The building still has at least 16 hard wired wall heaters that have been wired contrary to manufacturers installation instructions (wtih the electrical wire up against the heating element).  The installation was not done by an electrician and the hardwired installation was not approved by an electrician. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I paid the filing fees that were required for the cases to be heard.  So even if you do pay the filing fees you still don't seem to have access to justice in the courts.  
                            </p>

                            <p>It is false that the landlord relied on an electrician.  The evidence that the landlord supplied to the court was (1)  A report from an electrician that was very specific about light switches and rangehoods that did not mention wall heater.  (2)  A building report from Prestige Building Compliance that mentions that there is a heater affixed to the wall.  (3)  An email from a receptionist at the importer of Goldair saying that she thought the way they installed it was probably okay.  
                            </p>

                            <p>I am not too sure what the courts problem is, here.  I really genuinely do not understand.  Maybe Prestige Building Compliance have been doing electrical sign off for more properties around Auckland?

                                <li>The court refused to schedule a substantive hearing and awarded costs against me only.  It is not safe to travel to New Zealand.  The 'Health System' kidnaps people and unlawfully drugs them and the judiciary fails to function to uphold the laws of New Zealand.  There does not appear to be a health system, at all.  No medication charts.  No medical doctors.
