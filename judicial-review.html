                            <p>
                            I suppose it is an act of civil disobedience for me to be making public the two judgments against me that were ordered 'supressed' by the courts of New Zealand.  I have made the executive decision to make the judgments publically available, however, for the following reason:  Supression, in this instance, does not help vulnerable people.  Supression, in this instance, serves to conceal that the courts failed to uphold justice.  The building still has at least 16 hard wired wall heaters that have been wired contrary to manufacturers installation instructions (wtih the electrical wire up against the heating element).  The installation was not done by an electrician and the hardwired installation was not approved by an electrician.

                            <p>It is false that the landlord relied on an electrician.  The evidence that the landlord supplied to the court was (1)  A report from an electrician that was very specific about light switches and rangehoods that did not mention a wall heater at all (because one was not installed at that point).  (2)  A building report from Prestige Building Compliance that mentions that there is a heater that was affixed to the wall.  (3)  An email from a receptionist at the importer of Goldair saying that she thought the way they installed it was probably okay.   There was no indication tha the receptionist had consulted an electrician or the engineers who manufactured and safety tested the product to operate under certain conditions (ie with the electrical wire not in contact with the heating element).

                            The Education and Training Act outlines the Statutory Function of the NZVCC and the role of the head of that organisation.  It says they are responsible for upholding the quality and integrity of NZ Universities and that includes processing complaints of wrongdoing and protecting whistleblowers.  To this end the NZVCC has written policy documents on how they say they will handle complaints of wrongdoing.  That involves bringing the issues raised to a meeting of the Vice Chancellors else bringing the issues raised and the evidence supplies to police to arrange for prosecution.  Official Information Act request for information revealed that while Chris Whelan receives a great  number of complaints every year, he has processed or progressed none of the complaints in accordance with the NZVCC Policy.  That is to say none of the issues raised by complainants has been brought before a formal meeting of the Vice Chancellors (I offered to attend the meeting and raise the issue of NZ Universities not processing applications to enrol, mishandling official documents by refusing to get theses to external examiners, keeping false enrolment records and false transcripts of graduate student qualifications).  The High Court Judge said that it would be Ultra Vires for Chris Whelan to get a complaint and evidence supplied to the police or to a meeting of the NZVCC.  The High Court Judges said that Chris Whelan should update the policy documents to remove the parts that say that compliants will be given to police else forwarded to a meeting of the NZVCC.  NZ is not honoring international obligations regarding anti-corruption at all.  NZ is not even trying to keep universities.  There is no education and training system here.  Chris Whelan is paid hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to blackbird for slaves.  The Universities will not properly process applications to enrol or completions of training. There's nothing there.

                                Justice Fitzgerald found that I was techically correct in a technical matter therefore she awarded costs against me, since I was the correct party.  That means even though I was techincally correct on a technical matter I could not be regarded to be substantively correct.  One man's modus ponens is another man's modus tollens, you see.  I must pay I must pay I must pay I must pay therefore I cannot be substantively correct.  Rather, I get a discount on the amount that I must pay for being techincally correct.  This is because the NZ Judicdiary will not award costs to a self-represented litigant.  Not if they are a lawyer and certainly not if they are not a lawyer.  The Judiciary will not award schedule 2B costs to non-lawyers and the Judiciary will not award legal fees to compensate the self-represented litigant for their time.  Rather, the self-represented litigant is a slave to the courts who can only pay the courts pay the courts pay the courts pay teh courts pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for the government's crimes.

                                <p>What Justice system?</p>

                                <p>The University of Auckland is not properly processing applications to enrol in Medicine.  They refused to calculate my GPA according to their published criterion and offer me enrolment (or not) on the basis of my rank order score.  First they told me that they declined my application because my rank order score was too low.  I said that I found that hard to believe and asked them to supply evidence of that. They then supplied documentation to me as to how they miscalculated my GPA. I supplied them with the correct calculations (they had used one year I studied only part-time and another year they calculated the worst rather than best 120 points by disregarding a summer school paper I had done above stage 1).  They then refused to correctly enter my GPA and recalculate my rank order score.  Refused to do it.  The Dean refused to do it.  ANother Dean refused to do it.  Stuart McCutchen refused to do it.  His replacement refused to do it.  WOuld not do it.  They said that my GPA didn't matter because they said they regarded me 'ineligible to have applied'.  Justice Fitzgerald was able to understand that the education and training act states that domestic adults who are above the age of 20 are eligible to be enrolled in the programme they applied to and the University received my application to enrol.  The statue stated I was eligible.  The Univesrity had no authority to decline my application on grounds of ineligibility.  THey aren't properly processing applications to enrol.  </p>

                                <p>The lengths they go to to find the next Dr Green and Dr Leeks.  The lengths they go to to make the people pay the people pay the people pay the people must pay the people must pay and pay and pay and pay and pay so that Dr Green and Dr Leeks can be paid hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to enable their crimes.  The lengths the government and the judiciary go to to commit their crimes.  They aren't processing applications to Medicine.  They aren't progressing people through training.  They aren't graduating people who have met the requirements of the training programme.  They aren't publically advertising jobs.  They aren't hiring.  THey aren't even trying to be fair.  Dr Leeks gets promoted to position in Melborne.  Well, build a statute for him and his crimes.  The courts are waiting for the victims to die.  There isn't a functioning judiciary.  There isn't a functioning University.  There's nothing here.  Nobody home.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                                The Supreme Court ruled I have to pay for the University's refusal to progress applications to Medicine.  The University of Otago is throwing away applications before they are presented to the Medical Admissions Committee so as to prevent and prohibit certain applications or applicants from being considered alongside other applications or applicants on the basis of their academic merits.  What we are left with is the 'only game in town' ones that actually are forwarded to the Medical Selection Committee.  There is no alternative.  There is no alternative to Professor Glue's Glue Factory.  Nobody else's application was acknowledged as having been received by the University.  Only game in town.  Better get busy manufacturing LSD in the name of 'medical treatment for anxiety' so that they can 'prescribe it' (with no medical prescription for it recorded on the file) so if people complain about hallucinations we can write them up as delusional.  How much money does it cost to play Orthopedic Surgeon for 10 days and get to dump your wife at Hillmorton, these days?  Are we more corrupt than South Africa?

                                    The court refused to schedule a substantive hearing of the issues that I filed.  Instead, the ADHB chose to hire a QC to counter-file a motion to have my proceedings struck out without a substantive hearing of the claims that I had filed.  The Judge ordered things to proceed to a substantive hearing of the motion to have my proceedings struck out.  During that hearing my file notes were entered into the court as evidence of the ADHB having unlawfully detained me in conditions the UN likely would say amount to torture (had UN inspectors been allowed unrestricted access to the 'hospital').  My file notes document unlawful use of seclusion, coercion for me to take allegedly prescription medication that had not in fact been prescribed for me to take (no medication charts were supplied).  They document that I was unlawfully detained prior to them filing the paperwork for a lawful observation order and that I was unlawfully detained after the lawful observation order expired.  They write that I stated I wanted to leave the hospital but I was to be kept there 'voluntarily'.  Not a hospital, hey.  Not even trying to be.  
  
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    
                                    The court then stated that I was required to re-file my filings.  Keep slaving for the courts, Ms Roe.  Keep filing and re-filing and re-filing and re-filing with the courts, Ms Roe.  You will never be awarded legal fees because the courts don't award legal fees even to lawyers.  Also they ordered that I should pay the courts for the costs involved in a hearing of the motion to have my proceedings struck out without a substantive hearing.   

                                    The proceedings were not ordered to be struck out without a substantive hearing, however.  Rather, I was to pay the costs involved thus far and I was to keep filing.  I am to have debt recorded against my name only while I slave for the courts, now.  With prospects for only greater and greater and greater levels of debt to be recorded against my name.


                                </li>

                                <li>So...  Instead of the courts punishing the ADHB for an unnecessary step (filing to have my proceedings thrown out without a substantive hearing when my file notes that were entered into the court as evidence clearly document unlawful use of detention and seclusion and unlawful drugging by the ADHB)...  They punish me for having complained about these things to the courts.  They awarded costs against me.  They did not uphold the motion to have my proceedings struck out, even though they awarded costs against me.  They ordered me to re-file my filings.  To keep slaving for the courts.  I should pay for the crimes of the NZ government, says the courts.  I should pay the courts for the crimes of the NZ government.  The government says that need or demand for health services will always exceed  supply and to this end they keep people unlawfully detained in the name of 'health care'.  Keeping people in seclusion so that there are no witnesses of how they are kept in state care.  Drugging people (documenting they are being taken into seclusion and given prescription medication when they have no prescription records of medications being prescribed).  They aren't publically advertising positions, they are keeping postions empty.  They are waiting for the next Dr Leeks to be redeployed into position, one can only suppose.  Nobody else applied to be psychiatrist, you see.  Nobody else applied to Medical School.   Nobody else was acknoweldged as having completed that qualification.  Nobody else was registered by the Australaian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.  Nobody here. Nothing home.  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camps.  Government institutions of abuse up and down the land.  Punative detention camps.  Unlawful.  What education system?  What health system?  What judiciary?  What elected leaders?  Only game in town.  Only ones acknowledged as leaders by foreign powers, apparently.  Are their own in-bred kids so f*cking stupid, then, that they have to steal the work of the NZ slaves to pass off as their own.  So they have to redeploy foreigners into positions in NZ 'hospitals' and 'universities' because nobody will acknowledge that there are NZers who have the skills to work those jobs.  What jobs?  Corruption racket.   </li>

                                <li>I don't see how anybody can do business in or with NZ (in the NZ jurisdication) when they don't have a functioning judiciary.  Prison or detention camp of Australia.  For the crime of being born in NZ.</li>

                            <h3>SSAA37/2022.  Roe v Ministry of Social Development.</h3>

                            <p>Last event:  20 October 2022.  Substantive hearing.</p>

                            <p>Ms Roe applied for advance benefit payment to cover security for costs amount that had been set by Court of Appeal.</p>

                            <p>Ms Roe Responded to Court of Appeal request for security for costs to be paid by (1) Appealing this with Supreme Court.  Also (2)  Applying to the Ministry of Social Development for advance benefit payment to pay the security for costs amount that had been set by the court. </p>

                            <p>The Supreme Court saw fit to rule that Ms Roe's cases (Roe vs University of Auckland, Waikato, Otago, NZVCC) were personal and particular and not matters of public interest.  Also saw fit to rule that Ms Roe's cases were of no merit.  They decided these things without a substantive re-hearing.  Ms Roe thinks that it really rather obvious to everybody that it is a matter of public interest, indeed, that NZ Universities are not properly processing enrolments (particularly in Meidcine but also graduate research degrees) and are not allowing externals to sign off on qualification completions.  Also that Chris Whelan has not processed a single complaint of wrongdoing since he was appointed to office in 2014.  The Supreme Court is the highest court in the State of NZ, however, and the Australian Federal Government is refusing to hear cases from New Zealand wrongly claiming that it does not have Jurisdication (denying that NZ is a State of the Federation of Australia).</p>

                            <p>The Ministry of Social Development declined to supply advance benefit payment on the grounds that, or for the reason that, "Justice is not an essential need".  Ms Roe appealed the decision of the Ministry of Social Development that "justice is not an essential need (for NZers)" with the Social Security Appeals Authority.  The case was substantively heard in the District Court of Auckland on 20 October 2022.  Judgment is awaited.</p>

                            <p>Ms Roe has written to the courts to ask when Judgment can be expected since more than 6 months have passed since the substantive hearing.  The courts will not supply Judgment.  Ms Roe has written to the Prime Minister, Leader for Opposition, Minister for Courts, Minister for Justice, asking politicians to remind the Judiciary on expectations for timely delivery of Judgements.  Ms Roe was informed that independence of the Judiciary means that politicians are prevented from reminding the Judiciary on expectations for timely delivery of Judgments.  Ms Roe can hear the difference between political interference in the content of judgments and political interference when it comes to pressuring for timely delivery of judgment output.  Can you?  Can you hear the difference?  Corruption.  Corruption.  Corruption...</p>

                            <p>How much money has the NZ government chosen to spend on senior partners of major firms, queens counsel etc to defend their entitlement to prevent and prohibit there being justice for the people of NZ?  Also to prevent and prohibit healthcare?  Prevent and prohibit education?  Prevent and prohibit research?  The money they have chosen to spend on preventing and prohibiting social development.  How costly it has been to the NZ government to refuse to do any of the things they are supposed to do.  How much money they have chosen to throw away while claiming Ms Roe to be kept as hostage.  More and more and more and more money recorded against her name only while various other people get paid hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars to throw documentation away.  Una Jagose.  Chris Whelan.  A computer script hitting 'forward' on their email inbox to the police would do their job better than they do for considerably less cost to maintain ffs.  Corruption.  Corruption.  Corruption.</p>
