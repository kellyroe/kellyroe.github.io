                                The University is not processing applications to Medicine (at least) according to their own published algorithm as to how they will do that in the interests of public accountability.  The University refused to apply their published algorithm correctly to my application on grounds that they (unlawfully) deemed me ineligible to have applied.  That is to say they are not being acountable (or being held accountable) for how they are deciding which studnets to train for that programme.  This is a gross injustice.  It doesn't just affect me.  It affects everyone who wants to train to be a Medical Doctor and it affects everyone who needs to see a Medical Doctor in New Zealand.
