                            I am aware that you aren't supposed to comment on cases while they are working their way through the courts but how long is reasonable to wait for justice?  I have uploaded various pieces of evidence over on the writing tab.

                            The Universities of New Zealand seem to think that they have the power to decide whether or not to give a student their Degree on the basis of whether they like what the student has to say or whether they don't like it.  They think they are not required to allow students to work to international standards of academic scholarship at all.  They believe they are entitlted to circumvent the external examination process and refuse to get work to externals in order to prevent and prohibit timely completion of graduate research qualifications.

                            The supreme court requires me to pay more than $7,000 security for costs for the case to be heard on appeal otherwise the court of appeal will not book a date for the hearing.  Perhaps the court thinks that justice looks like crowd-funding a trial?

                            My complaint about the NZVCC is that they are not progressing complaints from students (former studnets) or staff (former staff).  They refused to progress my complaint about the University of Waikato mis-handling my thesis submissions and demanding I pay them a bribe by demanding I re-enrol in the MPhil and pay them more fees otherwise I would never receive the qualification.  

                            The NZVCC has statutory function to uphold the quality and integrity of NZ University qualifications.  But they are not progressing complaints.  So the people responsible for not progressing complaints need to be removed from office.  Else, what is supposed to happen?  Every student with a complaint is supposed to pay the courts thousands upon thousands upon thousands of dollars for access to justice through the courts?

                                </ul>

                                The issue here is that the University of Auckland informed me that that my application to MBChB was unsuccessful on the grounds that my rank order score was not high enough for me to be offered a place.  When I queried that it turned out they miscalculated my GPA.  
                                
                                Instead of them apologising for their mistake and recalculating my rank order score they informed me that it didn't matter what my rank order score was because I was ineligible to have applied anyway.

                                The Education Act says that domestic adults are eligible to be enrolled in the programme they applied to, however.  Therefore the University was wrong to have advised me that I was required to undertake further study in order to become eligible.  I would not have enrolled in the MPhil or written that thesis except that the Univesity told me they required me to complete a new programme of study in order to become eligible.

                                Then the University of Waikato did everything they could to prevent and prohibit the timely completion of my Degree so that Auckland could decline my application saying I was ineligible to have applied.

                                They set me up to fail in other words.  Which is not just.  Which is not fair.  I did what they asked of me and they had already made up their minds in advance that they were never going to select me.

They stated that I was ineligible to apply and they refused to consider my application on it's merits on the grounds that they had already made up their minds that they did not choose me.

                                I presented to the ED for medical care for a physical complaint.  They held me for nearly 1 day before completing the paperwork to detain me for a 5 day mental health assessment.  They then detained me in the hospital for 7 days writing in my notes that they were detaining me 'involuntarily' and refusing to allow me to leave the hospital 'due to lockdown policy'.  There is no medication chart and I was forced to take oral medication that is not documented on threat of being injected with medication if I did not agree to take oral medication.

                                I interpret this as threatening behavior.  Informed consent is not an option or is not something that the governemnt or the University of the health people value or will allow in New Zealand.

                                I cannot find a lawyer to help me progress the complaint.  The ADHB chose to use taxpayer dollars to fund themselves a QC.  They chose to file a motion to have proceedings struck out in their entirety.  The proceedings were not struck out but I was ordered to pay the ADHB money for their costs.  It seems to me the courts of New Zealand are an institution of government abuse, only.  I have not seen justice from the courts.  They seem to think their job is to promote and encourage gross injustice to proliferate or predominate.  They seem determined that there be no justice in the courts.
