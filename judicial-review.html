                            <p>
                            I suppose it is an act of civil disobedience for me to be making public the two judgments against me that were ordered 'supressed' by the courts of New Zealand.  I have made the executive decision to make the judgments publically available, however, for the following reason:  Supression, in this instance, does not help vulnerable people.  Supression, in this instance, serves to conceal that the courts failed to uphold justice.  The building still has at least 16 hard wired wall heaters that have been wired contrary to manufacturers installation instructions (wtih the electrical wire up against the heating element).  The installation was not done by an electrician and the hardwired installation was not approved by an electrician. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I paid the filing fees that were required for the cases to be heard.  So even if you do pay the filing fees there is still no justice in the courts of New Zealand. 
                            </p>

                            <p>Let's stop and pause, for a minute, to comprehend that.  Even if you do pay the courts, they still will not find in the interests of justice.  I mean to say that the NZ courts are not pay to win.  They will take your money and STILL refuse to uphold Justice.  I say this because people rightly point out that it is a bad look with Winston Peters and various other people, kim.com, say, seem to be paying the courts paying the courts paying the courts to have judgments go in their way.  But the courts are more than happy to take and take and take and take money and STILL find against justice.  I mean to say..  Even if you pay the bribes, you still don't get your way.  Can you hear the difference?  I'm not claiming that it is pay to win.  I am not claiming that, at all. </p>

                            <p>I don't really know what the problem is in this particular instance.  They want me to cry cry cry about how there isn't any Justice in New Zealand?  Someoen thought that that would be a good slave job for me.  I suppose that is it.  Prestige Building Compliance are able to sign off on installation of fire alarms.  They do fire alarm tests to check that fire alarms are in working order.  For apartment buildings.  They do this for the council, quite widely, I believe.  I suppose the situation was that they thought they would get into installing wall heaters.  The Auckland City Council was loooking to hardwire install something in the name of 'wall  heater' at minimum cost to themselves so they could say that only top up heating was required for the healthy home standards.  So they brought a bunch of cheap Briscoes Heaters that were those low wattage ceramic plates.  They thoguht by hardwire installing teh electrical cord they would only then need to supply oil colmumn or fan or whatever top up heating.  So there was a rush to purchase in bulk those kinds of heaters and have them hard wire installed by a deadline.  So, you know, as to ensure that buildings that were not up to temperature never would be.  Not on their watch. The reason or rationale  behind installing them intentionally to be fire hazards.  With the cord up against the heating element is less clear to me.  On the one hand it looks tidier from a building point of view to attempt to conceal the cord or the wiring.  So maybe it was simply that.  Them being builders, and all.  Or maybe there was some deeper intentionality.  Anyway...  It would be relatively trivial for them to move the position of the wire.  Not something that the user can do (rewire a plug) but it would be relatively easy for them to move the position of the cords.  But the courts have ruled that this wiring is okay.</p>

                            <p>If there is a fire in one of these private rentals (to Lifewise Trust, many of the apartments are housing vulnerable teenagers) or one of the Auckland COuncil buildings, then who will pay the insurance?  Will it be negligence at the hands of the landlord?  Prestige Building Compliance?  The courts have said that the present wiring situation is okay.  I had to pay the filing fee to establish that.  3 hearings of the tenancy tribunal and 1 hearing at the district court (the courts are so busy hearing cases over and over and over and over no time to hear any new cases).  It isn't exactly possible to do business in or with New Zealand?  I really genuinely do not understand what the hell went on / went wrong here.  Let this be a lesson to you all...  Whoever you may be.  Thinking of studying law..  Thinking of doing business in NZ.  Thinking of taking out insurance.  Is it the insurers who are corrupt thetn that they would pay out on such things as these while not paying out to private individuals who actually do the things they are supposed to do... Is this corruption or something else?  Incompetence?  Or some deeper systematic f*cking nastiness.  I don't know.</p>

                            <p>It is false that the landlord relied on an electrician.  The evidence that the landlord supplied to the court was (1)  A report from an electrician that was very specific about light switches and rangehoods that did not mention wall heater.  (2)  A building report from Prestige Building Compliance that mentions that there is a heater affixed to the wall.  (3)  An email from a receptionist at the importer of Goldair saying that she thought the way they installed it was probably okay.

                                I was eligible to be enrolled -- by Statute because I am a domestic adult who has attained the age of 20 years.  They refused to calculate my GPA in accordance with the algorithm they published for the purposes of their accountability as to how it is that they decide who is to be enrolled in MBChB when there are more eligible applicants than available places in the programme.  They are throwing away applications from domestic adults (who are eligible by statute) without grounds (saying they decide that they are not eligible when the law says they are eligible by statute) in order to fill up the training places with the children of the administration.  So they can get busy preventing and prohibiting New Zealanders from having access to timely quality health care and medical treatments.  Because there must never be enough to go around etc.

                                <li>The court refused to schedule a substantive hearing and awarded costs against me only.  It is not safe to travel to New Zealand.  The 'Health System' kidnaps people and unlawfully drugs them and the judiciary fails to function to uphold the laws of New Zealand.  There does not appear to be a health system, at all.  No medication charts.  No medical doctors by the seems of it.
