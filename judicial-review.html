                            <p>
                            I suppose it is an act of civil disobedience for me to be making public the two judgments against me that were ordered 'supressed' by the courts of New Zealand.  I have made the executive decision to make the judgments publically available, however, for the following reason:  Supression, in this instance, does not help vulnerable people.  Supression, in this instance, serves to conceal that the courts failed to uphold justice.  The building still has at least 16 hard wired wall heaters that have been wired contrary to manufacturers installation instructions (wtih the electrical wire up against the heating element).  The installation was not done by an electrician and the hardwired installation was not approved by an electrician. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I paid the filing fees that were required for the cases to be heard.  So even if you do pay the filing fees you still don't seem to have access to justice in the courts.  
                            </p>

                            <p>It is false that the landlord relied on an electrician.  The evidence that the landlord supplied to the court was (1)  A report from an electrician that was very specific about light switches and rangehoods that did not mention wall heater.  (2)  A building report from Prestige Building Compliance that mentions that there is a heater affixed to the wall.  (3)  An email from a receptionist at the importer of Goldair saying that she thought the way they installed it was probably okay.  
                            </p>

                            <p>I am not too sure what the courts problem is, here.  I really genuinely do not understand.  Maybe Prestige Building Compliance have been doing electrical sign off for more properties around Auckland?  I think there was some mention of Prestige Building Compliance being authorised to sign off on fire alarm checks as a building compliance issue.  But that is different from hard-wiring low-wattage heaters to themselves be fire hazards in Auckland Council Buildings so that they can, I can only suppose, set the whole thing on fire for the insurance money when it is time to pay the workers or time to let the prisoner slaves go.  I don't think we have any builders, anyway, do we?  I don't think they acknowledge that anybody from New Zealand graduates from or themselves holds any kind of building qualification.  Do they?  I think they send all the ones from the Northern Hemisphere who were unwilling or unable to do the job over there...  Don't they?  Wink wink nudge nudge who likes to party?

                                <li>The court refused to schedule a substantive hearing and awarded costs against me only.  It is not safe to travel to New Zealand.  The 'Health System' kidnaps people and unlawfully drugs them and the judiciary fails to function to uphold the laws of New Zealand.  There does not appear to be a health system, at all.  No medication charts.  No medical doctors.

                        <div class="container">

                            <p>The Government is the major employer.  Private businesses often only exist because of the Government choosing to contract out work and funds to the business.  For example, the Private Law Firms in Auckland seem to exist because of the lucrative Government work they are handed.  For example, in the above cases the Universities of Auckland, Otago, Waikato, and the NZVCC all saw fit to hire for themselves people from Private Law Firms to defend themselves in court.  Quigley (acting in his capacity as VC of the Univesrity of Waikato) very specifically told me that if I was unhappy with the University (e.g., for them refusing to get my work to externals in order to withhold my qualification and force re-enrolment) then I should take them to court.  He seemed to want to spend taxpayers dollars hiring people from private firms in the Waikato to spend time and money and energy and effort defending the indefensible in court.
                            </p>

                            <p>The Government is not processing applications for employment properly any more than the Government Education institutions are processing applications for enrolment and qualification progressions and comletions.  They are not being fair in how they select what (if any) people they employ for Government jobs.  They keep some people on considerably more years of 'frictional unemployment' than 1 year and they intentionally wait (for example) until they have declared qualifications expired, and the like.  But also they don't think there is anything to stop them simply hiring whomever they choose.  They intentionally seem to give working identification cards and working identification numbers and building swipe card access to...  University 'students' so they can attend cadavar labs.  To...  'Employees' passing themselves off as NZ Medical Degree Graduates to swipe into hospitals and present their identification badge to patients.  Corruption.  There is nothing here.
                            </p>

                            <p>The New Zealand Government chooses to refuse to uphold the laws.  It really does not seem to matter at all what any of the laws are because the judiciary refuses to uphold the laws.  The Law is very clear on tertiary education institutions being required to process applications to enrol by domestic adults.  But the Univerities simply refuse.  THey choose to put teenagers into positions of doing abortion and euthanasia, now, and so on and so forth.  THe idea being to burn them out until...  A few certain special kids remain.  Likely the ones whose parents are also Medical Doctors or Research Scientists who will do what they are told when it comes to fetching patient samples at all costs.  For example, recently a Research Scientist who was involved in making a cervical vaccine in Brisbane resigned.  I suppose we wonder why he was unable to make a Covid vaccine if he really did make the cervical one before.  Apparently all his children are Medical Doctors.  I would suspect that they likely get themselves all virus infected and go on to perform cervical examinations on women.  To get the virus that they believe causes cancer to spread.  So that cervical cancer can be a particular problem in Australasia.  So that they can be hailed and revered for fixing the problem that they made.  I would imagine that is the basic idea.  Why they are so very very determined to have some people's kids in the programme and why it is that they repeatedly refuse to process or progress applications from other people who would not willingly or knowingly participate in these kinds of atrocities.  There does not appear to be a functioning health system.  Government system of abuse.
                            </p>

                            <p>The New Zealand Government chooses to keep me on welfare / government benefit.  Apparently I am supposed to consider myself soooooo lucky becuase they could simply choose to cut it entirely at any time.  And then what would I do?  I would be forced to...  Well, I'm sure they would prefer me to prostitute myself or to live as a slave in someone else's basement with the permission of the slaver.  If that isn't appealing then I guess I can take up a life of crime, then.  And then, what?  The Governmetn will see fit to punish me by choosing to keep me in prison, then?  Is that how it works?  The Government would rather keep me in prison at the cost to the taxpayer of what??  Because they are too busy picking and choosing some special kids to abuse others and they didn't pick me for an abuser, therefore...
                            </p>

                            <p>You look at the (only game in town) research that they choose to fund.  It seems pretty much always to be in the vein of 'if you give me $800,000 then I will keep 200 people in conditions of slavery'.  THe only applications for research funding that they don't throw away.
                            </p>

                            <p>The Judiciary is refusing to uphold the law.  The Tenancy Tribunal...  What was that about?  Best I can figure it was a signal to me to signify that there would be no justice whatsoever in the courts for me.  I mean, it seems clear to me that Adjudicator Tam was on the take or similar.  He was grossly unsuitable to be an Adjudicator in the Tenancy Tribunal.  He lacked the willingness and / or ability to identify evidence that had been presented to him.  He makes blatant error of fact (asserting that the landlord relied on his electrician when the evidence was that he did not rely on his electrician).  The District Court Judge was similarly unwilling and / or unable to do his job.  Complete and utter farce.  What a f*cking farce of a situation.  On the take?  I don't understand why re-hearing after re-hearing after re-hearing was granted.  I suppose it is good to give people every opportunity to present evidence..  But then it was simply asserted that evidnece was supplied - when it is missing (because it does not exist) in fact.
                            </p>

                            <p>The courts fail to function.  As does the education system.  As does the health system.  There is nothing in Australasia.  Land for criminals.  The world will ship it's offenders here, I suppose.  Australasia seems to want to conduct itself in this manner or way so I don't see how anything else can actually  be, here.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The Ministry of the Prevention and Prohibition of Social Development together with the Supreme Court and the Social Security Tribunal have worked together to delay proceedings for another year while they decide just how blatently explicit they can be about how there is no justice for people whom the governmetn has chosen to keep on Government welfare.  I mean to say, that they have all ruled that I am to pay more than $20,000 security for costs or all the cases will be deemed abandoned.  It isn't only that the governmetn lacks the willingness and /or ability to instruct or employ government prosecutors willing and able to prosecute the public univerisities choosing to violate statute (where the attitude of the VC's is hahaha and what are you or what is anybody going to do about it) but the government chooses to hemmorrhage money to firms to defend their law violation and the government chooses to hemmorrhage money to vc's who pretend to be too stupid or blatently psychopathic to follow the statututory laws..  The Governmetn chooses to appoint judges and adjusdicators who don't have the willingness and / or ability.  Chooses to pull them out of retirement, even (not following process on how they are to be appointed).  Let me guess.  They have decided to pull these incompetent judges out of retirement and reappoint them so that they can waste a good 10 to 20 years of everybody's time trying to have them removed from office when they never should have been put on office nd given payroll anyway (since they were over the age of 75 when they were appointed to position but that's not the problem really the problem really is their inability or unwilliness to properly identify the relevant laws and teh relevant evidence).  I mean to say...  The High court judge thinks that discriminating against candidates on the basis of race or disabiltiy information is perfectly acceptable because the universities can make whatever enrolment decisions they like without any accountabiltiy whatsoever.  That was ruled by the high court. The Universities of New Zealand would really have been going to town, since then, I would imagine, given the ruling of the courts that the Universities of New Zealnd are not required to follow statutory law and / or the Bill of Rights either.  The Supreme Court does not think this a matter of public interest.  I am to pay I am to pay I am to pay I am to pay for the crimes of the New Zealand Government.  Say the Judges of the NZ courts.  On..  HOw much money does the NZ governmetn hemmorrhage to the Judges of the NZ courts pulled out of retirement for precisely the occasion (but judgments upheld by the court of appeal).  Nobody home.  Nothing there.
                            </p>

                            <p>The UN told the Governmetn to restrict the abuse in state care investigation (that every other developed nation has done, already) to GOVERNMENT care (not private churches) between certain years (past not present) in order for them to get appropriate funds (compensation or reparation) to the victims.  This was to  be the first step only.  Setting a precedent that it was more costly to abuse your people than to not abuse your people thereby creating a financial incentive for all the psychopaths out there.  The governmetn refuses to do it.  They were supposed to pay compensation to the victims.  They refuse to do it.  The courts keep the money for themselves.  They refuse to get the money to the victims.  Won't do it.  The judicairy appears to be eveyr bit as corrupt at the government.  They simply won't do it.  Lagging behind every other nation.  Will not do it.  Won't do it.  Won't do it.  Won't do it.  New Zealand does not have a functioning...  Anything at all.
                            </p>

                            <p>So this year..  Again..  Another lot of wrongly decided wrongful deathbringers for the hospitals of New Zealand.  They aren't processing the applications properly.  They aren't providing applications.  They aren't doing any of hte things that they are supposed to do.  It is like that episode of Opera (the idea has been done over and over before) where you sort of arbitrariliy split the class into two groups and say one lot are the prison guards and the others are to be treated as underclass criminals.  And off they go.  The population.  That's what it's like in NZ.  Some people are arbitrariliy put into these positions and paid a lot of money and sometimes it's who their parents are and sometimes it's random but it's always ot abuse and treat badly.  ANd then there are the others who are kept poorly and badly only.  It isn't a merit based system and often it doesn't seem to have anything to do with who your parents are, actually.  It's just a large social experiment, really, isn't it?  In the prevention and prohibition of social development.  How poorly you can keep people as poorly poorly poorly poorly poorly as you can.  THey are fudging the wrongful death statistics by reclassifying from 'suicide' to 'unexplanied' and so on.  People don't want to live, here, often.  Also the government doesn't want people to live, here, often.  Wrongful death after wrongful death after wrongful death.  There's nothing here.</p>

                            <p>The Universities published a selection criterion for the purposes of accountability.  The Judicary refuses to hold them to account. Theh Governmetn employees (the Vice Chancellors and the Deans and the like) laugh in the face of the Judiciary and the Judiciary fails to do it's job.  The job for which they are very very very well paid (and immune from being removed from office insofar as they f*cking well do their job and uphold the law).  But they refuse to uphold the law.  The court of appeal refuses.  The supreme court refuses.  The administration needs to go because nothing functions in NZ.  It is not possible for people to function, here.  Australia doesn't seem to be wanting to do any better.  They take people like Harlene Hayes and Dr Leeks and Kim Sterelny, nd the Lndlord who miswired many apartments in Aucklnd to be fire hazards, and sets them up in highly lucrative government jobs in Australia.  That is or means to say that the Australian Government seems to want Australia to be just as non-functional as New Zealand is.  They seem to want to roll that out more widely in teh world.  There being nothing here.  The complete and utter stabotage and undermining of everything progrmme. Insofar as I can see.  No health system, no education system, no legal system or judiciary.  The government does not function.  It doesn't matter what the laws are because the judiciary refuses to uphold the laws.  There's nothing here.  They aren't processing applications for education and training.  Tehy aren't publically advertising employment.  They aren't employing people into the jobs.  They aren't paying the workers.  There's nothing here.</p>
