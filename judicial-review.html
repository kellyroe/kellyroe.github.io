                            <p>
                            I suppose it is an act of civil disobedience for me to be making public the two judgments against me that were ordered 'supressed' by the courts of New Zealand.  I have made the executive decision to make the judgments publically available, however, for the following reason:  Supression, in this instance, does not help vulnerable people.  Supression, in this instance, serves to conceal that the courts failed to uphold justice.  The building still has at least 16 hard wired wall heaters that have been wired contrary to manufacturers installation instructions (wtih the electrical wire up against the heating element) to the best of my knowledge. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            This case is also interesting because I paid the filing fees that were required to be paid for the cases to be heard.  This is interesting because the Court of Appeal is making it look like I'm not accessing Justice because I'm not paying them more than $20,000 that was set by the Court of Appeal for the cases to be heard. But the Tenancy Tribunal shows that even if you pay the fee you still won't have access to justice.  So, lack of money is used as an excuse to throw cases out of court, but even if you do have money to pay into the court system, you still won't have access to justice.
                            </p>

                            <p>Also, the courts could have awarded me money at certain points and then asked for me to give the money back.  For example, they could have awarded me (and not Ailsa Claire) costs for throwing out their application to have my proceedings struck out.  Then I would have obtained money for that filing which I could then have used to give the courts for security for costs.  But the courts have only found against me every step of the way.  I post the filings because I think it is obvious to everyone that they not being fair at all and they are not upholding the laws at all.

                            <p>It is false that the landlord relied on an electrician.  The evidence that the landlord supplied to the court was (1)  A report from an electrician signing off that various things (light switches, electrical powerpoint outlets, rangehood) were all okay.  That electrical report was very specific about the various electrical things that were in the apartment.  There was no mention of a wall heater having been hardwire installed on the wall in the electrical report.  That is to say, the electrical report did not say anything at all about a wall heater having been installed but other items were specifically mentioned.  (2)  A building report from Prestige Building Compliance that mentions that there is a heater affixed to the wall.  Prestige Building Compliance is (as you might think) a building outfit of builders that do various aspects of building compliance.  They are not electricians and they are not appropriate tradespeople to be doing electrical compliance (by their own admission).  (3)  An email from Sue the receptionist from the importer of Goldair saying that she thought the way they installed it was probably okay.  There is no reason to believe that Sue the receptionist is an electrician.
                            </p>

                            <p>I am not too sure what the courts problem is, here.  Is this sort of gaslighting response from the courts something that other people experience, too, or is there some special mark against my name in NZ such that I just get continually subjected to what can only be described as garbage output.

                            <li>The decision was upheld by the Supreme Court and a few thousand more court costs were awarded against me and to the courts.</li>

                            <li>I applied for an advance benefit payment to pay the security for costs amount that was ordered by the courts.  The Ministry of the Prevention and Prohibition of Social Development ruled that Justice was not an Essential Need which was upheld by the Benefits Review Committee.  Now the Tribunal wants to allow more than 5 weeks (they get an extension) for the Ministry to say something before a phone conference.  I would imagine the point of the phone conference will be so that the judge can be sure to change the issue from one I can win into one that I can't win, that makes me look bad for having brought these things before the courts.  Only then will a hearing of the issue be scheduled.  I have more than $100,000 studnet loans for NZ courses and qualifications that NZ Universities refuses to acknowleldge.  I have over $80,000 debt to the Ministry of The Prevention and Prohibition of Social Development mostly for emergency housing but also for things deemed 'essential'.  
                            </li>

                            I only returned to NZ from Australia  because I believed I could pursue entry to MBChB in New Zealand as a NZ citizen. I did everything Auckland asked me to do even when they asked me to do things they had no authority to ask me to do (e.g., complete a new programme of study from NZ for purposes of 'eligibility').  I have applied for various employment in New Zealand and nothing has come through for me, at all.  What few jobs are actually advertised do not appear to be hiring, at all.  They will decline my application outright and then re-advertise the position the very next day.  They fill the positions with unpaid 'students' 'workplace internships' so they collect money from the 'students' rather than so much as paying them even minimum wage.  I have a good work history teaching and also part time in hospitality in Australia where they stated I was professional in my conduct and friendly in my demenor and people seemed to like me.  New Zealand refuses to allow me to function, at all.  There is nothing here.

                            Chris Whelan has used his position to refuse to progress any of the complaints from students and from staff against any of the Universities of NZ since he was appointed to office.  There aren't any whistleblower protections in NZ, they simply take the complaints, engage in bullying the people who have complained (blaming them for complaining and maybe booting them out of the Universities and maybe even the country for having complained).  You bring this issue to the courts attention and they choose to blame you for complaining.  The Judiciary in New Zealand does not function at all.

                                Ailsa Claire in her capacity as CE of the ADHB chose to hire a QC to file to have my proceedings thrown out without a substantive hearing.  She chose to do this rather than choosing to work with me to ensure that what happened to me does not happen to anybody else presenting for treatment from the ADHB.

                                The Judge berates me for the quality of my filings.  Refuses to appoint an amicus.  Refuses to appoint a Legal Aid Lawyer.  Does not schedule a substantive hearing of the issue.  Does not uphold my interlocutory (or costs involved in my having filed it).  Does not uphold the motion to have proceedings struck out -- but required me to pay the costs involved in the hearing of that matter...  A decision that was upheld by the Supreme Court.

                                I get invoices, now, from the ADHB saying I ower them more than $5,000 for the costs involved in their having a QC file motion to have my proceedings struck out.  They seem to think they can keep adding money, compounding the bill, because I'm not paying them in a timely fashion.  This is the public health system of New Zealand.  Sending invoices to people for having complained (to the courts) about being unlawfully detained by them in conditions that may even amount to torture according to the UN.  They are detaining people unlawfully in not fit for purpose buildings.  I did not present asking for a psych assessment.  They choose to keep me for one.  In a room with extensive cords.  With a sharp in my arm.  With strobing blue-white flourescent light (not simply the usual flicker when bulbs are at end of life).  With intermittent beeps from medical equipment.  With the door closed.  With no natural light.  By myself.  For more than 12 hours.  Not allowed a phone call to police or a lawyer.  They send me a bill for having complained.

                                It isn't really safe for anyone (e.g., tourists) to come here.  A volcano could explode (like White Island) and then there won't be skin for grafting, there won't be nurses for burn care.  They will find themselves bathed by random strangers who claim them as 'family'.  There doesn't appear to be anything here...

                                The Judiciary will not uphold the laws of New Zealand.  The point of the Independence of the Judiciary is to grant them the freedom to uphold the law.  They are not upholding the law.  There is a process for appointing new judges -- and they refuse to follow it.  They are reappointing judges out of retirement.  I don't know if the reappointed judges are actually writing their own judgment or if they are being held as hostages simply required to sign off on the judgments that are given to them.  It boggles the mind, really, to think that the supreme court judges listed in the judgments I have received, are people who studied the law and have the conception of justice.  Law, in New Zealand, seems only to be a mechanism for the government to oppress the people.  Government departments and agencies are now taking a more pro-active approach in suing members of the public who may not know they can simply ignore civil proceedings against them and who feel forced to pay the courts, pay the courts, pay the courts, pay the courts, pay the courts.  Various people are kept in prison (e.g., Brian Tamaki) for saying things the government does not like (this is not part of the free world people think they have the right to kill, silence, exterminate that which they do not like).  Psychiatry, also, is simpliy a political tool of oppression, in New Zealand.  As is law.  As is the education system from primary school up through the highest level.  Medicine is also a tool for oppression.  All the observational studies of people being kept in inhumane conditions knowingingly by people on government payroll.  Their repeated refusal to acknowledge or process or progress any of my work because I'm not involved in some project of torture, deprivation, abuse.

                                My Grandfather was a Methodist Reverend who was imprisoned for being a pacifist.  He was trying to help men in his congregation who did not want to voluntarily go into prison or detention camps overseas during the second world war by having some kind of theraputic community on his parents farm in Kio Kio.  Have them building houses and doing some farming etc.  But the Government chose to contract to people to build camps on NZ soil for the contientious objects (some were sent overseas and staked on enemy land like Baxter, but others were imprisoned in camps in NZ).  There are pictures of the camps with barbed wire fences.  They were punative camps designed to punish the men for not willingly going into foreign concentration camps as 'prisoners of war' overseas.  That's a thing to do, right?  Instead of a government possibly being hated by the people for imprisoning so many of their own population you can just swap undesirables with another nation (preferbly one who doesn't speak English) and blame them for atrocities.  Then you can have all your fun committing atrocities against their unwanted people.  Anyway, the point is that there was land for houses to be built and a way of life.  To grow the community.  But that's not half as fun as torturing people.  Right?  So my grandfather was imprisoned for harboring contientious objectors who did not want to go off to die.  He was deordained.  Imprisoned in New Zealand.  The Government would only contract torturers and abusers.  Would only contract people to be punative.  Would not allow there to be theraputic communities in New Zealand.  The Government, generally, hates the Methodists because of the ideology where every single kid gets their very own copy of the Bible for them to read independently and where they get to develop their own personal conscience or personal relationship with God based on their own understanding.  The role of the leaders is to share their experiences and understanding on the basis of their personal reflections and they have no further authority to tell the people what God orders or dictates they should do, or what God (via the Government) tells the people they must do.  I don't know that my Grandfather was opposed to men going off to war (he wasn't involved in the protests he was trying to get the Labor party to allow him to have a theraputic community of men who chose for themselves to be part of it).   But that was considered a threat to the government so they imprisoned him.

                                My Mother did not raise me religious, particularly.  He was estranged from the Church after having been deordained.  Methodism is very...  There isn't much of it left, in NZ, anymore.  The Government imprisoned the men in concentration camps and / or sent them off to die anyway.  So...  But I suppose the ideology is still there, on some level, where the Governmetn does not want every kid to have a book or to develop their own conscience.  The Government will tell the people what God wants the people to do.  The Government, for all intents and purposes, is God.  Right?  We serve justice or health of people on Mondays (when the ones with the good post-codes come in) and ourselves every other day of the week?  No?  We bow before justice on Wednesdays and everyone bows before us otherwise?  No?  The Government does not want even the Medical Students reading the Medical Books...  It's all about state sanctioned abuses.  Torture.  Deprivation.  Punative.  New Zealand is not (is not allowed to be) theraputic community, at all.  There's nothing here...  It was convenient for the Government to allow the Methodists to encourage Maaori to be pacifists when it came to laying down arms against the NZ government -- but then Maaori were supposed to... Just keep on laying down arms by voluntarily choosing to go be imprisoned overseas or be shot or whatever, when it came to WWII?  Otherwise the option was punative treatment back home.  I guess the idea was that no matter how bad rumors were of prisoner of war camps overseas, the ones here would need to be even worse than that so as to be a sufficient deterrant.  Right?  How bad do you need to treat people in NZ so that the German pow camps would seem to be a prefereable option?  The 'Party Line' wasn't that they were  being handed over to the Nazis, though...  Or maybe the Japanese...  I don't know...  Seems more likely to me that they would be exterminated a little closer to home.  Save on shipping.  Maybe outback of Australia... the 'Party Line' was that they were...  I don't know...  Standing up for the elite white back in New Zealand who got to take control of their wives and mothers and sisters and children, now?  I don't remember how the Government Propaganda was supposed to go...  Anyway...  Point is, they seem to be still at it.  Yawn.  The Principle of Charity can only get one so far...  Is it that we are so very very bad at being good?  Or is it rather that we are so very very good at being bad?  Look at the torture studies they choose to fund and invest in.  Look at how they refuse to progress or process any of my work.  Look at how they hide the Medical Books (in Book Jail where you need to hand over your student ID card in order to get them from 'University' library).  Look at how the Government does it's best to limit the information to the people.  The Government will decide what is right for you.  And look at the wonderful job they are doing.  How productive, happy, healthy the people of New Zealand are.  The quality of the hospitals and prisons and schools and so on...  Punative.  There's nothing here...
