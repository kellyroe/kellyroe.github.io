                            <p>
                            I suppose it is an act of civil disobedience for me to be making public the two judgments against me that were ordered 'supressed' by the courts of New Zealand.  I have made the executive decision to make the judgments publically available, however, for the following reason:  Supression, in this instance, does not help vulnerable people.  Supression, in this instance, serves to conceal that the courts failed to uphold justice.  The building still has at least 16 hard wired wall heaters that have been wired contrary to manufacturers installation instructions (wtih the electrical wire up against the heating element).  The installation was not done by an electrician and the hardwired installation was not approved by an electrician. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I paid the filing fees that were required for the cases to be heard.  So this illustrates that even if you do pay the filing fees there is still no justice to be found in the courts of New Zealand. 
                            </p>

                            <p>Let's stop and pause, for a minute, to comprehend that.  Even if you do pay the courts, they still will not find in the interests of justice.  I mean to say that the problem is not that the NZ courts are pay to win.  The problem is a different thing entirely.  </p>

                            <p>It is false that the landlord relied on an electrician.  The evidence that the landlord supplied to the court was (1)  A report from an electrician that was very specific about light switches and rangehoods that did not mention a wall heater at all (because one was not installed at that point).  (2)  A building report from Prestige Building Compliance that mentions that there is a heater that was affixed to the wall.  (3)  An email from a receptionist at the importer of Goldair saying that she thought the way they installed it was probably okay.   There was no indication tha the receptionist had consulted an electrician or the engineers who manufactured and safety tested the product to operate under certain conditions (ie with the electrical wire not in contact with the heating element).

                            Chris Whelan has used his position as VC of the NZVCC (operating as 'Universities NZ') to refuse to progress any of the complaints from students and from staff that have been lodged against any of the Universities of NZ since he was appointed to office in around 2014.  This was revealed in an OIA request for information.  He maintains that the entirety of the complaints that he has received (of which there have been many) are simply 'personal problems'  between the complainant and certain other individuals (supervisors, university administrators) and not complaints of wrong-doing, at all.  It is not a systemic matter or issue that students and faculty are being bullied into leaving the university without credit, acknowledgement, pay for the work they have done for the university.

                                    The court refused to schedule a substantive hearing of the issues that I filed.  Instead, the ADHB chose to hire a QC to counter-file a motion to have my proceedings struck out without a substantive hearing of the claims that I had filed.  The Judge ordered things to proceed to a substantive hearing of the motion to have my proceedings struck out.  During that hearing my file notes were entered into the court as evidence of the ADHB having unlawfully detained me in conditions the UN likely would say amount to torture (had UN inspectors been allowed unrestricted access to the 'hospital').  My file notes document unlawful use of seclusion, coercion for me to take allegedly prescription medication that had not in fact been prescribed for me to take (no medication charts were supplied).  They document that I was unlawfully detained prior to them filing the paperwork for a lawful observation order and that I was unlawfully detained after the lawful observation order expired.  They write that I stated I wanted to leave the hospital but I was to be kept there 'voluntarily'.  Not a hospital, hey.  Not even trying to be.

                                <li>
                                    
                                    The court then stated that I was required to re-file my filings.  Keep slaving for the courts, Ms Roe.  Keep filing and re-filing and re-filing and re-filing with the courts, Ms Roe.  You will never be awarded legal fees because the courts don't award legal fees even to lawyers.  Also they ordered that I should pay the courts for the costs involved in a hearing of the motion to have my proceedings struck out without a substantive hearing.   

                                    The proceedings were not ordered to be struck out without a substantive hearing, however.  Rather, I was to pay the costs involved thus far and I was to keep filing.  I am to have debt recorded against my name only while I slave for the courts, now.  With prospects for only greater and greater and greater levels of debt to be recorded against my name.

                                <li>So...  Instead of the courts punishing the ADHB for an unnecessary step (filing to have my proceedings thrown out without a substantive hearing when my file notes that were entered into the court as evidence clearly document unlawful use of detention and seclusion and unlawful drugging by the ADHB)...  They punish me for having complained about these things to the courts.  They awarded costs against me.  They did not uphold the motion to have my proceedings struck out, even though they awarded costs against me.  They ordered me to re-file my filings.  To keep slaving for the courts.  I should pay for the crimes of the NZ government, says the courts.  I should pay the courts for the crimes of the NZ government.  The government says that need or demand for health services will always exceed  supply and to this end they keep people unlawfully detained in the name of 'health care'.  Keeping people in seclusion so that there are no witnesses of how they are kept in state care.  Drugging people (documenting they are being taken into seclusion and given prescription medication when they have no prescription records of medications being prescribed).  They aren't publically advertising positions, they are keeping postions empty.  They are waiting for the next Dr Leeks to be redeployed into position, one can only suppose.  Nobody else applied to be psychiatrist, you see.  Nobody else applied to Medical School.   Nobody else was acknoweldged as having completed that qualification.  Nobody else was registered by the Australaian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.  Nobody here. Nothing home.  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camps.  Government institutions of abuse up and down the land.  Punative detention camps.  Unlawful.  What education system?  What health system?  What judiciary?  What elected leaders?  Only game in town.  Only ones acknowledged as leaders by foreign powers, apparently.  Are their own in-bred kids so f*cking stupid, then, that they have to steal the work of the NZ slaves to pass off as their own.  So they have to redeploy foreigners into positions in NZ 'hospitals' and 'universities' because nobody will acknowledge that there are NZers who have the skills to work those jobs.  What jobs?  Corruption racket.   </li>

                                <li>I don't see how anybody can do business in or with NZ (in the NZ jurisdication) when they don't have a functioning judiciary.  Prison or detention camp of Australia.  For the crime of being born in NZ.</li>

                            <h3>Social Security Appeals Authority</h3>

                            <p>The Supreme Court found that Roe v University of Otago, Waikato, Auckland, New Zealand Vice Chancellor's Committee were all very particular and personal matters concerning Ms Roe only and as such they were not matters of public interest at all.  They also declared that none of the cases had any merits at all.  They did not see any problems, at all, with NZ Universities not propertly processing applications for enrolment (to the competitive MBChB progamme and to the MPhil programme with 05 March 2018 start date where Ms Roe was the only applicant for that programme).  They did not see any problems, at all, with NZ Universities not getting theses out for external exam.  Sending them out to be examined for qualifications that were different from the ones the studnet had applied to be enrolled in and was enrolled in (e.g., sending 50,000 word Masters theses out with instructions for them to be examined as 100,000 words Doctoral theses).  No problem with the Univesrity then making final decisions that were not at all based on the contents of external examiners reports (they had decided that they were going to re-enrol Ms Roe before they sent her thesis out and even when the external requested an oral examination they would not schedule one becuase they recorded that she 'failed'.  The Supreme Court doesnt' see anything wrong with any of this.  The Supreme Court doesn't see anything wrong with Chris Whelan refusing to process her complaints of the University's wrong-doing.  Doesnt' see anything wrong with the fact that he has NEVER processed a single complaint (after saying he was inundated with complaints every year).  He doesn't get any of them to police or allow any of them to proceed to a meeting of the NZVCC.  The Supreme COurt of NZ doesn't see anything wrong.  Instead, Ms Roe is supposed to pay and pay and pay and pay for the crimes of the NZ Government.  </p>

                            <p>Ms Roe applied for advance benefit payment to pay the more than $30,000 security for costs that the Court of Appeal stated she was required to pay for the cases to progress through the court of appeal.  The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal decisiont o require Ms Roe to pay security for costs.  Work and Income declined to grant advance benefit payment to cover the security for costs on the grounds that "Justice is not an essential need".  Ms Roe appealed the decision of the courts that "justice is not an essential need" and that case was heard before the social security appeals authority near the end of last year.  More than 6 months ago.  The social security appeals authority says they have been off sick and they have been off on holiday and they are late and they are overwhelmed and they are not providing a judgment.  There is no justice in NZ.  There isn't anything here.  Nobody home.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  There is no functioning judiciary. </p>

                            <p>All the money the government pays.  To senior partners in major firms.  To Queens Counsel.  To assert the Governments right to do anything anyting anything and the people must pay and pay and pay for the crimes of the government.  Wah wah wah the government doesn't have any money.  But they will pay and pay and pay and pay and pay to make sure that Dr Leeks 2.0  is the only person to have their application processed for Medicine, only person to be put on payroll as Medical Doctor, only person to be acknokwledged as having completed their training.  Everyone else's application was thrown away.  The money they choose to pay Una Jagose for her role in throwing away evidence, in ordering evidence to be thrown away.  NOt even trying ot be fair at all.  Corruption.  Corruption.  Corruption.  Corruption.  There are none so blind as those who will not see.  Corruption.  Corruption.  Corruption.</p>
