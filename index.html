                            <p>Australiasia does not have an education and training system.  I'm not sure whether England or the USA has an education and training system, or not.  I guess it is better developed with curriculum contents.  Pathoma's Pathology.  First Aid for the USMLE.  Curriculum contents.  So you can take a look through the curriculum contents of what you will be learning if you enrol in that programme of study.  That was supposed to be the idea, anyway. </p>

                            <p>Where is the curriculum contents for Australasia?  What textbooks do they assign, then, in their University Academic Courses?  What was the reading age supposed to be, for their students?  Big Robbins..  Rather than Pathoma...  Big Robbins was accompanied by a multiple-choice book, though, right?  So the examination assessment questions were picked out from the accompanying test book.  No?  So you have a lot of questions to learn the answers and commentray.  That's the knowledge-base.  Hey, you could just make up your own questions -- maybe ones with no right answer.  Overwhelm with small unrelated details to prevent understanding or building up of an overall picture...  What education and training system?  Last's Anatomy?  Really?  So that we can listen to the surgeons talk through their descriptive anatomy while they are doing procedures and operations?  Know their anatomy from Last's, do they?  They start with the surgical safety check-list (from pilot safety) -- right?  (1)  Let's start by introducing ourself.  Our name.  Our registration number.  Our role in the operation today.  We know who is responsible for the tray.  We know who is responsible for declaring closing only once all items that are supposed to be on the tray have been returned to the tray.  Nononononononono.  That is not how we do in Australasia.  What education and training system? </p>

                            <p>They are advertising, now, for 'not training positions' in the hospitals.  They want people to do their surgeries and they will call them 'Registrars' but they won't say that they are formally accepted into their training programme -- because they don't have one.  There isn't anything there.  Nobody will teach them anything.  They won't pay people to teach the next generation.  THey will only pay people to bully and abuse and not do the job for which they are paid.  </p>

                            <p>Who would teach the next generation?  I think you have a bunch of 65+++ year old guys who have no intention of retiring.  They'll die  before they'll retire.  THey won't voluntarily stand down.  THey won't voluntarily walk away from the money.  They certainly won't voluntarily walk away from the power.  How do they choose who their supposed 'apprentices' are?  By photos?  And their apprentices are required to do anything anything anything anything else they can say their apprentices are crazy psychopathic rubbish rubbish rubbish.  That the basic ideology?  How many decades was Carl Brusse an apprentice of the Philosophy Programme of the Australian National Univesrity?  Research School of Social Science?  For how many years?  The people on payroll to work in the Research School HAD NO TEACHING. They did not teach classes.  THe only thing they had to do was output research of their own and supervise their graduate research students.  Why didn't they get Carl's work output to external examiners after he'd been enrolled for 2 years to allow up to 1 year of external examination process?  Why didn't they get ANY of their studnets work output to external examiners?  Nobody had an externally examined oral defence, for example.  Nobody.  Various people said the University told them that their work had been accepted without any changes required.  I don't think it plausible that external and independent examiners didn't find so much as a single typographical error.  Not so much as a single extra reference to be added (maybe to their work).  I don't find that very plausible at all.  I wonder, actually, how  many of them actually wrote their own work, at all.  How many of them were given others work output to pass off as their own.  </p>

                            <p>Go to 'University' to eat your lunch?  Have morning and afternoon tea?  Dinner?  Drinks?  Go away on camping trips?  Live in your supervisors house?  Housesit for him while he goes off on family holidays...  IT TAKES THE WORK -- AND IT GETS IT TO THE EXTERNAL EXAMINER ffs.  IT HAD ONE JOB TO DO.  I mean, he could have helped me with my research.  He was paid to do that...  And what meetings did we have about my research, then?  When did you ask to see my research?  When did you supply me with comments on my research?  When did you supply me with readings or instructions?  If you aren't going to do your job then the least you can do is get out of the f*cking way.  How old are you?  Is Frank Jackson still on payroll?  He still supervising students, is he?  What education and training programme?  Taken over by psychopaths.  There's nothing there.</p>

                            <p>That was Sterelny's point, of course.  Australasia does not have an education and training programme.  It has been taken over by psychopaths.  THey will need to die before there will be employment in the field for various other people.  Think the issue with Sterelny was that academia is a farce.  A joke.  I mean to say, what happens with the Journals is that they get submissions from people and they don't engage in blind peer review at all.  Rather, they look into who the stated author is and delay and rubbish rubbish rubbish the output of anyone not already on payroll  -- if they even acknowledge receipt of the submission at all.  THen, once they've bullied the author out of the field entirely they re-attribute authorship to someone else and try and conceal that behind a paywall.  Was Sterelny the author of even half of what he claims as his own publications?  Unlikely.  Try and have a yakkity yak yak to him about his own publications.  He won't.  He can't?  What a scummy scam. </p>

                            <p>There isn't a health system in Australasia because they don't have informed consent.  Can't do it / won't do it.  No conception of it.  Simply don't care.  THey don't think that people have the right not to be subjected to medical experimentation.  Animals.  They treat the population like animals.  Not behaviorally modern, eh, Sterelny.  Or, as you would say:  'F*cked the dog, mate, you f*cking c*nt'.  That's right, he's not behaviorally modern, at all.  What education and training system?  Will not pay people to work that job.  There's nothing there.</p>

                            <p>I only mention Carl because he was enrolled and re enrolled and re re enrolled for decades -- right?  While Kim tells him that his work is garbage garbage garbage rubbish rubbish garbage garbage.  The topic he is working on (personal identity) was rubbish rubbish garbage.  Useless waste of time stupid project etc etc.  Right?  That's what I heard Sterelny say about Carl, after a few drinks, anyway.  I don't know what happened to the earlier work that Carl did on personal identity.  If he was given to people at Princeton to pass off as their own?  What they do is move people around when it is time to sign off on completion of their studnets work.  Not all of the studnets, but some of them.  Trying to figure out which ones in particular they identify as 'only over my dead body'.  The ones who aren't obviously dependent on them for their own work output, I suppose.  I guess that is the idea.  If Carl is writing stuff on personal identity that obviously and clearly does not sound like he's a puppet of Kim then that's a threat to Kim in a way that he isn't if his work output is him parroting Kim's views.  Something like that...  Anyway, I mention Carl  because if I mention me and focus on me then people will say that the problem is with me.  I must be garbage crap. </p>

                            <p>How do you commit a genocide, would you reckon?  The answer to that is one by one by one by one by one.  The point being a divide and then conquer strategy.  You focus on one and on undermining and elminating the one.  It is personal against them.  Very particular and personal just about them.  But with the threat that anybody who isn't with us (part of the herd throwing rocks) will be the next one identified to be the target.  The next one.  One by one by one.  </p>

                            <p>I suppose they will have records of enrolment dates associated with the theses they acknowledge as having accepted.  THey will also have records of students who were enrolled in the 'University' to do research.  Aisling..  How many years was she re re re re enrolled.  Oh, that's the thing.  When it was time to get Carl's work to external examiners his ANU supervisor announced a move to Princeton.  So he wouldn't be around to sign off on Carl (because they don't do external examination).  Right?  Aisling...  Who was her supervisor?  Jatzec..  I can't remember how to spell his name..  So many of the students...  How many years were they kept re re re re re re re enrolled?  Page 1 of First Aid for the USMLE says not to give glucose or dextrose or carbohydrate or sugar to people at risk of vitamin deficiency (e.g., alcoholics, anorexics) before giving them B suppliment because otherwise you can induce Wernicke Encephalopathy.  So the person goes into a coma and has cognitive problems.  That's what they did to Dave Wall -- correct?  Gave him glucose before thiamine.  How many years was Dave Wall re re re re re re re enrolled to give more and more and more and more and more work to Daniel Stoljar?  What do you meeeeeeeeeean by first key word in sentence one?  Every f*cking talk...</p>

                            <p>For quite a long time I wondered what Kim saw in Brett.  Because Kim seemed fairly anamoured by him.  And I wasn't sure why.  I remember various people being somewhat helpful around the department while I was adopting LaTex (I didn't have a computer science background, at all).  Except for Brett.  He was the only one to be like 'you know, they used to pay me, to work in IT I'm not helping you for free'.  I don't know what I was supposed to say in response to that.  Maybe 'oh, they used to pay you to work in IT -- but now they don't'.  Maybe that was his point.  I was getting higher quality assistance by people not on payroll for that.  Which was why they paid him.  Or used to.  Or something.  I guess it's likely to be about the Journal Submissions.  The website.  So that people from around the world can relatively easily email their work to the Journal.  And the Journal says that they need to keep their research all very secret and not tell anybody they've done it while it is under consideration by the Journal'.  And after 5 years it's regarded as abandon-ware, right, Kim?  There for the taking.  Re-attribution of.  That probably was the value of Brett.  The IT support.  That's how he gets publications that seem eloquent and why he isn't so willing to talk about actual work (his or anybody else's) unless people have had a few drinks first.  I wouldn't imagine that he actually was the author of some of it...  Nearer the end of my time at the ANU he was giving rudimentary talks on Philosophy of Mind.  Like he was presenting a class of first year studnet's output as his own.  Read like a first year studnet's essay on the subject.  I guess that was there point.  What education and training system?</p>

                            <p>So  now the Journal has gone to Penn because Penn likes to think of itself as a literary output research University.  And Brett's married off to a graduate of there who gets to be a relatively new hire for the 'University' of Auckland.  So she can write about Maaori and science.  Sort of take Dawkin's 'The God Delusion' (which came out about the time when I was working on delusion -- which would be why they were interested in suppressing my narrative, I suppose)...  Take that stuff and apply it to Maaori Science stuff.  Of course we will need an American to come here and tell us about how Maaori and science is supposed to go.  How old is Robert Nolan?  When is he due to retire?  F*ckign get out.  What University?  There isn't anything there...  Oh..  My point was why they didn't hire Brett for the Philosophy Job at Auckland?  I guess his wife has the fancy Penn Degree so they want to credit her as the author of a bunch of stuff to make people pay and pay and pay and pay and pay those Australian Dollars, I suppose, to send their kid to Penn in the hope that some 65+++ year old man will take a liking to them, or something, and give them a thesis, all of their own!  </p>

                            <p>Not even trying to be fair, at all.  These old men need to get out.  Go off to the detention camps that they made.  The aged care facilities staffed by the only people they would not really pay to 'work' in them.  Taken over by psychopaths.  Stupid selfish idiots.  Well done Dawkins.  Quite the ideology you have there.  Wouldn't have things any other way.  HOw old are you?  GET OUT!!!!!!  F*cking hell...  Where are your studnets?  Your former studnets?  All the people you trained?  WHere are they?  What education and training system?  Hurry up and f*cking die, already.</p>
