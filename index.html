                                <p>I was treating publishing as being similar to hitting 'compile' on a LaTeX document.  I mean to say, I was saving things regularly and much of what I published on this index was a work in progress.  I moved from VS Code to Sublime Merge and messed things up because I need to understand what is going on with origin and source and master etc.  Basically, version control management software was not designed to be used like a 'compile' function with cloud-save.  Or similar.  Anywhoo...  I have  been de-motivated.  Laying flat.  Or something.  I just posted this to say that I did not mean for the content that has persisted on this index to be on this index for more than about 5 minutes.  As part of my process of thinking aloud / working through.  I think most people would process such thoughts by having a chat to someone else.  I don't have anyone to chat to about these things so I work things out for myself in print over time.
