                            <p>
                            The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications.  They define a 120 point program of study (e.g., the 120 point MPhil program of study that I applied to be enrolled in) as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a>.  Despite this, the Universities of New Zealand believe they are entitled to refuse to get students work to examiners so as to prevent and prohibit timely qualification completion. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            It is tone deaf (to say the least) for Jacinda Ardern to have accepted an honorary PhD in Law from Harvard (graduating class of '22) given how New Zealand treats it's own domestic and international students by withholding qualification completions so as to force re-enrolment and to force them to work, effectively, as slaves.  I don't know if there is a set-up for the Harvard Law PhD class of '22 to have someone to sue for loss of value to their Degree qualification or if the entire cohort of the Harvard Law PhD class of '22 didn't do any course work or readings or attend any lectures or sit any breadth requirement or do any of the things you would expect for a Harvard PhD Programme.  Perhaps the Harvard Law PhD Degree is an honorary Degree entirely.  Only given to students who did not attend the University and who did submit any assignments or write any thesis. 
                            </p>

                            <p>  
                            The University of Otago (1) refuses to supply applications to some candidates (2) throws away applications from some candidates prior to assessing the application on it's merits (3) collects up disability information prior to selection for purposes of exclusion only (there is no equity pathway for disability).  The High Court of New Zealand has found that there is nothing legally wrong with the public University of Otago choosing to conduct it's business in this manner.  I filed with the Court of Appeal but they refuse to progress my filings because I did not have $7,060 to pay the security for costs amount required by the courts.  The University of Otago chose to require me to bring this to the courts.  The Univesrity of Otago chose not to put things right internally.  The present Univesrsity of Otago Vice Chancellor chooses not to put things right internally.  They believe they are entitlted to select whomever they want for whatever program they want for whatever arbitrary reasons they want.  I post my filings with the Court of Appeal here.  You may want to consider this situation (with the Univesrity of Otago and also with the Courts of New Zealand) very carefully before you decide whether you want to do business with New Zealand:
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  The Justice for the High Court Proceedings was one who seems to have been pulled out of retirement for the occasion.  The government chooses to get judges out of retirement rather than appointing new judges.  I do not know if the judges grand-son or great grand-son was offered a place in a program (or graduation from a program) for his role in the proceedings.  Was offered a reference for his application to Harvard.  Decide for yourself the value of a University of Otago Degree. Otago is a public university of the New Zealand government.  It is not a private university.

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings on grounds that it had already passed judgment on the filings and would not revisit the issue.  They did not think my filings sufficient to show there had been a grotesque injustice in how they handled my filings.  I post them here so you can judge for yourself.  
                                </p>

                            The Australian Constition says that New Zealand is a State of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  
                            New Zealand is listed as one of the original states of the federation of Australia.  It states that New Zealand has not been asked to be part of the Commonwealth, and it has not consented, but it is expedient to regard it to be a part of the Commonwealth.  It is declared to be part of the Commonwealth.  There has not been a referendum or whatever needs to happen to alter the constitution to have New Zealand removed from it's status as part of the Constitution of Australia.  As such, I don't see how it is lawful for Australia to require New Zealanders to have Australian Visas - even less to remove visas and deport people to the State of New Zealand.  I don't see how it is lawful for Australia to withhold Australian Passports, Birth Certificates, and Australian Wages from New Zealand Government employees (e.g., nurses etc).  Withholding voting papers for the Australian Federal Elections.  Refusing to allow people who were born in New Zealand to run for office in Australia or to work in Australian Government Positions (post 2002 or similar).  I don't think it would be lawful for Australia to choose to treat Tasmanians the way they treat New Zealanders.  Making a new currency for Tasmanians to disguise just how low wages are kept.  Australia treats New Zealand like an off-shore detention centre or prison of Australia.  Australia treats all New Zealanders as violent offender criminals.  Australia expects New Zealanders to be second or third class Australians taking only the jobs that Australians don't want.  Australia tries to force people to desire to move to Australia by keeping things very very poorly in New Zealand.  It chooses to engage in a race to the bottom.

                            <p>
                            The Universities of Otago and Auckland are not being fair as to how they are choosing what students to enrol in Medicine.  It wasn't that Dr Leeks (Dr Green etc) happened to slip through a selection criterion or process objectively and fairly applied.  It was that he or they was or were hand-picked or specially chosen for demonstrating all the qualities it is that they value.  I suppose, then, Dr Leeks was transferred to Melborne because that is also what they value over there.  I don't see what else we are supposed to think about that when they harbor him they way they have chosen to.  They are not even trying to be fair.  They appear to be trying to select people who will use their position to bully and abuse and commit violent criminal acts.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The Universities and courts have broken the social contract.  The Courts have chosen to set precedent that it will cost upwards of $20,000 to take a case against the University to the High Court, and even then they work to delay and obstruct and prohibit and prevent justice.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I started a PhD with the Australian National University.  They chose to offer me Australian Government Funding (APA) in order to do a PhD with the ANU.  They chose to do this after seeing how I worked at the ANU as a Summer Research Scholar.  They chose to give me a VC Award so I could travel to UNC, Chapel Hill for an academic year and do coursework and teaching in the USA.  But my Supervisor (Kim Sterelny) wrote a Slavery Manifesto during my time there ('The Evolved Apprentice') with a lovely cover of giving a monkey a peanut.  I was bullied into leaving the University without receiving a PhD.  Apparently there wasn't any point giving me a PhD because there never would be a job for me.  Apparently I would need to wait until the older generation died before there would be a job for me!  I post my PhD work on this site (on the writing and seminar page).  I applied to START a PhD with the ANU for 2022 and my application was declined.  Apparently I haven't even done enough work to START a Phd with the ANU!  I can't wait to see the CV of the new intake of students to their PhD programme!  The publications they must have, already!  Or maybe the ANU acts in bad faith in the way in which it treats at least some of their students.
                            </p>

                            <p> They are getting my student records together to get back to me.  Apparently they have them already, I don't know why they need so much more time before releasing them.  I haven't seen anything at all for me to think that they act with any integrity at all.  That they would be interested in putting things right rather than attempting to cover things up to protect their own reputation.  I don't see how it would help their own reputation to cover things up.  Then they will just be known for covering things up.  Still, I haven't seen anybody even attempt to do anything fair or just or right for so long, now...
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            You think it is just a culture of bullies.  That people are bullies.  But it is when you start to stand up for yourself and not be bullied that you see the lengths they will go to to force you to comply.  And it isn't that they are bullies.  You really see the lengths that they will go to in order to force compliance.  They are a darned site more than mere or simple bullies.

                            <p>
                            Otago has recently claimed that a reason why graduation was cancelled and we didn't see any research students publically credited with having completed their research qualification was because they received threats of violence from a former student.  It does occur to me 'there is no excuse for threats of violence'.  But it also occurs to me that there is no excuse for how Otago has chosen to treat it's students.  I feel so sad for that girl who was failed by Otago 2 years in a row.   What options are there for students or employees or slaves or volunteers when people who have kept them working or studying do not honor terms and when the courts refuse to uphold the law?      
                               </p>

                               <p>
                                The Education and Training Act 2020 and the Education Acts prior to that all stated that domestic adults who had attained the age of 20 years were eligible to  be enrolled in the programme they applied to.  They stated that teenagers (under the age of 20 years) were able to be enrolled by the University only if the University was satisfied that they were able to complete the course.  So, when we hear of a Univerity being satisfied enough that a teenager could complete the course so as to enrol them and take their money and we then hear of the University failing them for their course not only once, but two years in a row, then it really looks like the University has some explaining to do as to how it was that they could not pass the student.  The High Court of Dunedin did not see it that way because the Judges don't seem willing or able to understand justice.  What did the judge get for seeing nothing wrong?  What did Justice Toogood get for not properly looking into the cause of death of Mason Pendrous?  He was active online.  A change to his online activity would have a date stamp.  He would have had friends online.  He was a computer science student ffs.  Of course he was spending a lot of time working on computers.

                                The New Zealand Government has chosen to create and impose incentive structures incentivising slavery.  Preventing and prohibiting the development of training systems and skilled labor.

                                <p>
                                New Zealand does not seem to have a functioning judiciary.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgement_of_Solomon  This is what justice looks like.  I don't know that many people, within New Zealand, would even know what justice would look like.  The ruling of a wise judge.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                https://journal.nzma.org.nz/journal-articles/an-ethical-dilemma-informed-consent-balancing-patient-dignity-and-medical-student-participation-in-sensitive-examinations  I guess the situation is more likely to be like this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNedXZ3vHZQ  Nobody had to tell the Nazi doctors to sing while they marched people off to the death-camps.  They did their work with joy in their hearts.  You just can't teach these things.  The New Zealand Medical Students (some of them) hesitate.  That's how you can tell who won't be graduating with their Medical class.  Or, even if they do, they won't be selected for further training.  Or, even if they are, they won't be signed off from having completed it.  But even if they are, they won't be shoulder tapped for employment.  But even if they are, they won't pay them.  
                                </p>

                                  <p>
                                There is no 'ethical dilemma'  between 'educational opportunities' on the one hand, and upholding informed consent (treating the patient with dignity), on the other.  This is because you are not teaching students how to perform intimate examinations or surgeries when you are requiring the students perform sexual and physical assaults.  If you don't know the difference between an intimate exam and a physical or sexual assault then you need to stand down.  I didn't properly appreciate that abortion was criminal until 2020.  In practice, they just got someone signing off that the woman would suffer mental distress if she didn't get the abortion she wanted and in that way they were all approved on mental health grounds.   But they were delayed, first, of course, so the teenage boys could get to experience being renegade women's rights warriors or liberators not wanting the word to get out how many abortions they'd done in case their lives were endangered by the anti-abortionists.   
                                </p>


                                <p>Here are  <a href="judicial-review/sup-court-waikato.pdf" target="_self"> My Filings </a>to the Supreme Court regarding the Public New Zealand Universities discretion to decide on 'personal grounds' who they choose to enroll (or not) progress (or not) or pass (or fail).  You can see the filing date on my submissions.  The courts are not progressing the filings and so I post them here so that other people can see that they are not progressing my filings.  You need to think about the cost of doing business (of trying to do business) with people who do not act with any integrity and who not care, at all, about the quality of the qualifications.  They think that there is nothing more to qualifications than pay-cheque.  So their whole thing is delaying and preventing and prohibiting and obstructing and denying so that they can keep the money for themselves.  Apparently you need to pry the money out of their cold dead hands.
