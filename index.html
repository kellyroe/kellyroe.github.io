                                <p>I suppose I will clean this page up, at some point.  There are links to things on this page that I want to keep.
                                </p>

                                <p>I do believe that I started by speaking directly to people's faces.  Then, when they were dismissive of me, I wanted a written record of the interaction.  Then, when they were still dismissive of me, I gave them the opportunity to put things right.  Then, when they were still dismissive of me I went over their heads.  If they didn't want me screaming this stuff from the rooftops then they can't say that they didn't have the time or the oppportunity to put things right years and years and years ago.  Still, today, all the active busy-work going into delaying and obstructing and preventing and prohibiting and confusing...  No hint of 'try'.  
                                </p>

                                <p>Apparently how they treated me was some kind of model or template or ideal as to how they could treat others.   How they disabled me (how they record me as being incompetent and illiterate and so on) is a model of how they can disable anyone.  Right?  I mean, if I am illiterate then surely they can pronounce and proclaim anyone anyone anyone at all to be!  If I don't have the capacity to do math or I don't have the ability to get my work done and in on time then they are free to prounce that everybody is New Zealand is intellectually handicapped.  Anybody they want.  Right?  They can just pronounce the entire country to be, right?  I mean...  Nobody actually can do anything at all, in New Zealand.  Right?  Without a special permission exemption on personal grounds.  Right?
                                </p>

                                <p>We hear of all the crimes of the people on Government payroll as 'Medical Doctors'.  Most of them aren't, of course.  They pay the Univesrity they pay the University they pay the University and get to pass themselves off as doing or being anything anything.  Until they stop paying then it is time for them to go away.  There is nothing actually here.  Or, there's people picked because they thought they would make the next Dr Leeks or Dr Glue.  That is to say they would do any atrocities, any any any any any atrocities at all.  Try and make the little boys behave like little girls for the sexual gratification of the tourists.  Etc.  Drug the people into shutting up about the crimes of the Government and the Government Employees.
                                </p>

                            <p>The Tertiary Education Commission defines a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  
                            <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a>.  The Universities and the Courts will not accept this, however.  They will not allow people to complete their work in a timely fashion.  They force extensions.  Sometimes studnets are outright bullied into not handing their work in.  Sometimes they pretend they never received work that was in fact handed in.  If you keep records of the fact that you handed the work in before the deadline then the University and the Courts both still deny it.  They will not allow people to complete their work in a timely fashion.  Because it is not an education system.  It is an unlawful slave or detention camp for endentured servants.
                            </p>

                            <p>The Judiciary is now imploding.  Making it obvious or apparent to everyone that there isn't a functioning Judiciary, etiher.  Read the Judgements of the courts for yourself.  Particularly the Supreme Court Judgements.  See how they order or instruct me to refile and refile and refile my filings?  THere is no precedent for a self-represented litigant to win costs.  Most of the time the courts will not award the full amount of the financial costs to the successful party (they prefer to jump on the bandwagon of harming the person who is the victim of injustice even if that means blaming the victim and accusing them of being half way responsible at the very least).  That is to say New Zealand does not have a functioning judiciary.  Kim.com pays the courts he pays the courts he pays the courts so he is not extradited to stand trial in the USA.  New Zealand put out a beacon for all the criminals of the world to come to New Zealand and pay the courts of New Zealand for delays and delays and delays with no extradition.  New Zealand put out a beacon that we are a slave camp detention centre endentured servant slum of the world.

                            <p>This stuff gets repetitive.  There must be something wrong with me that other people no comprehend-aye?  Maybe if I explain it just one more time, just a little bit more slowly?  No?  That's not the problem?
                            </p>

                            <p>Apparently I don't get to do Medicine (really) because I passed the ethics test - where passing the ethics test means failing to gain entry to Medicine in New Zealand.  Because we don't have a health system, at all.  How much will people pay to get to do anything anything anything anything in the hospitals?  So many things that psychopaths have the desire to do...  Well, come to New Zealand, then.  No liability for any of the things that you do.  ACC will just bully your victims into shutting up else the courts will ensure that they die before any kind of justice is forthcoming at all.  For how little did the New Zealand Government sell out the health of the people?  The Government?  What's that?  Wouldn't that require an actual election and stuff?  But the people are kept in conditions where they don't even have secure post-boxes.  What Postal Service?  The one that takes post and dumps it because they will not pay the workers?  That one?

                            <p>Here is how much the Inland Revenue now says I owe the New Zealand Government for my 'Education' and 'Training' that are not acknowledged because New Zealand qualifications apparently expire 5 years post-graduation (well, not the Judges law degrees, apparently, but my qualifications have expired): 
                            <a href="judicial-review/ird-shot.pdf" target="_self"> $104,663.</a>  You can see, then, that New Zealand does not appear to have functioning Universities, they appear to have detention or forced labor camps.  They won't progress or process academic work (particularly research).  They refuse to get official documents (theses submitted for examination) to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit external examiners signing off on qualification completions.  There is no skilled labor workforce, in New Zealand, because New Zealand has a series or system of forced labor detention camps only.  You pay the University you pay the University you pay the University you pay the University.  Maybe they put you to work as an actor playing the part of a skilled professional.  Then, when you are done paying them, your qualifications are withheld.  
                            </p>

                            
                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  They aren't progressing the filings. They are refusing to supply applications, refusing to process applications on their academic merits.  Apparently it isn't a matter of public interest how they pick and choose people to pass themsleves off as 'doctors' in our hospitals.
                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  Demanding me to pay more and more and more money to the courts else they force all my cases aborted, or abandoned.  <a href="judicial-review/sc-eyes.pdf" target="_self"> Here is the Judgement of the Supreme Court that I am attempting to appeal on the grounds that it is manifestly grotesquely unjust. </a>  It is like they have their eyes poked out.  Our highest court does not seem to have the conception of justice, at all.  It was the courts decision to delay Roe v University of Waikato proceedings until AFTER Roe v NZVCC and also until AFTER Roe v University of Auckland.  The Judge for Roe v NZVCC made all kinds of pronouncement in his judgment on the matter of Roe v University of Waikato.  That is to say instead of judging the issue he was supposed to be judging (the inaction of Chris Whelan in his capacity as CE of the NZVCC) he thought he would weigh in on whether or not I had done enough for completion of the MPhil Degree.  Clearly that is a matter of the Judge of a different case to decide!  
                            </p> 

                            <p>
                             <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  The Australian Constitution clearly names New Zealand as a state of Australia.  They say that they don't have to honor the constitution because New Zealand officials did not turn up to various things and they did not consent.  I don't know why Australia would care about consent in that instance.  Did they care about the consent of the Aboriginal people of Australia?  Did they care about consent of people to be immunised or subject to medical treatments or experimentation?  If they want to change the constitution then there is a process for it to be changed.  I think it involves a vote.  But New Zealanders don't get to vote so the Australian Government clearly does not care whether or not the people of New Zealand consent.  New Zealand functions as a detention camp of Australia.  But then, Australia still seems to govern like it is a detention camp of the Northern Hemisphere, so...
                            </p>

                            <p>Here are  <a href="judicial-review/sup-court-waikato.pdf" target="_self"> My Filings </a>to the Supreme Court regarding the University of Waikato    
                            </p>

                            <p>Una Jagose doesn't seem to have the job of instructing Crown Law to prosecute corruption within New Zealand Universities, or within the Judiciary (where judges refuse to accept evidence and where the supreme court punishes people for bringing injustices before the courts).  I suppose that is why they pay her more than half a million dollars to do that job.  They pay her to ensure the job is not done by anyone.  Not by her and not by anybody else.  The fact she is in the job prevents and prohibits the job being filled  by anyone with the willingness and ability to do the job.  It seems there is no evidence that they will accept that would attest to corruption.  None of the invoicing information that I provided (e.g., 0.5 EFTS = 120 points = 60 points = indefinate enrolment).  New Zealand does not appear to have a functioning judiciary.    <p> <a href="judicial-review/crown-law.pdf" target="_self"> Blow off response. </a>  
                            </p>

                            <a href="judicial-review/adhbinterlocutory.pdf" target="_self"> My request for permission from the High Court to appeal their decision to award costs against me with respect to the ADHB having chosen to file motion to have my proceedings struck out rather than the ADHB having chosen to stop with involuntarily detaining people in conditions likey amounting to torture. </a>  That sounds confusing.  It all starts to sound confusing, doesn't it.  The gaslighting garbage output nonsense nonsene nonsense from the courts.  Denying the evidence.  Refusing to acknowledge the half of the laws that speak to the duties and responsiblities and actual job descriptions of the various government departments (e.g, the NZVCC and various of the Universities).  
                            </p>


    <p>Evidence of corruption.  <a href="writing/lawsociety.pdf" target="_self">Letter from the Law Society (PDF)</a></p>

    <p> Here we have a letter from the Law Society that declares that Philip Cornege is conflicted out of representing a party when his wife (K Cornege) has been employed by opposing counsel. 

     <a href="writing/conflict.eml" target="_self">Here is a letter from me to the Court of Appeal informing them of Phillip and K Cornege being being employed by opposing counsel in certain matters of corruption to be heard in the Court of Appeal (.eml). </a>  (The file format is .eml which means it will use your browser or your email programme to open the text file).  I notified Una Jagose of the conflict on April 25 2021 at 7:24pm by email.  K Cornege responded to me as follows:  'Phillip does not act for the Commissioner of Police, but for MAP and Associates Trustee Company Limited.  There is no conflict between our respective clients, whose interests are aligned for the purposes of the High Court proceeding and appeal.  I recognise that the Court of Appeal list is somewhat confusing as to who acts for whom.' Yes.  I am confused.  K Cornege and P Cornege are on different sides of the 'v' which means they are acting on opposing sides with respect to these proceedings.  Me soooooooooooo confuuuuuuused.  Yeeeeeeees.  That must  be the problem. The response I received from the Court of Appeal was to say 'as you are not a party to this proceeding we are unable to discuss matters of party representation with you. No correspondence will be entered in to regarding it.'  That is how the Court of Appeal saw fit to respond to my concern by email on 2 October at 10:24am.  That is to say they (to the best of my knowledge) refused to look into the conflict and / or refused to do anything at all about the apparent conflict.</p>

    <p>K Cornege of Thompkins Wake also pointed out to me that the finding of P Cornege being conflicted out of representing anybody who was opposed by the University of Waikato since they had put a dollar in her pocket - was a finding that I was supposed to keep secret and not publicise.  That he sat on filings for several months only later to claim to be conflicted out was also something that I was supposed to keep secret and not publicise.  If the Law Society had seen fit to do it's job properly then I wouldn't need to publicise it becuase things would have been dealt with internally, in house.  But the Law Society brushed off my complaint / blew off my complaint.  So I now inform the public so they know what kind of people they may be dealing with.  I see that P Cornege is now claiming on his website to be employed by the Government for the abuse in state care inquiry.  I wonder if this is because they have collected up evidence of him being willing to delay proceedings and being willing to blame the complainant (e.g., construe Roe v University of Waikato as my being upset I did not get my qualification rather than an issue to do with how they are incorrectly invoicing students and how they are mishandling official thesis documents etc).
    </p>

    <p>You can see from the letter that the Law Society said I needed to pay them $50 if I wanted to take the complaint further.  I did the filings for taking the complaint further.  I filed that IF Mr Cornege was in fact conflicted out (as the Law Society found that he was) THEN he did not get to have a professional opinion on the mertis of the case.  I did not have $50 at the time to pay the filing fee that the Law Society asked of me.  I requested the Law Society waive the fee in my case on the same grounds that the High Court waives filing fees for people in receipt of Work and Income Benefit. The Law Society response to that was that they did not have to, I could not make them, and I was to pay them, otherwise there would be no justice for me.  That's the Law Society.  The professional body governing professionalism in Law in New Zealand.  Refusing to consider a case where someone claims to be conflicted out of progressing proceedings... Where the guy delays filings for a couple  months and (more problematically in my mind) he insisted on construing the case as a case with no merit.  That is or means to say he insisted on construing the case as being me being personally upset about not getting the qualification.  When my filings construed the case for the Law Courts as being a matter of the Univesrity acting Ultra Vires.  Issues of them not doing what the Law stated they were required to do when it came to processing applications and when it came to them incorrectly invoicing, keeping false records of studnet progress, false transcripts, adn misusing official thesis doucments by refusing to examine them.
    </p>

<p>It seems to me that there is an apparent conflict.  I am sorry that Philip Cornege was not willing to regulate his behavior.  But he did not, so I had to complain to the Law Soceity. I am sorry that the Law Society did not deal with it.  They didn't, so then the issue comes up for the Court of Appeal.  I am sorry that they did not deal with it.  They didn't, so now the issue goes before the public.  Every oppportunity.  Every opportunity.  I start by being reasonable and rational and polite.  FOR HOW MANY YEARS SHOULD I BE PATIENT BEFORE IT'S TIME TO SCREAM?  AT WHAT POINT DO I THINK IT MIGHT BE NICE WERE THE WRATH OF THE GODS TO RAIN UPON YOU.  Hey that's a good reason to arrange for people to be murdered and start over with a new lot of kiddies.   
    </p>


    <p>Universitites, District Health Boards, Government Departments are not being fair in the way they handle (actually mis-handle) applications.  Concrete examples.  The University of Waikato wanted to have a yakkity yak yak yak yak yak about why I had not been ranked for PhD (doctoral) scholarship in their meeting about who was going to be granted doctoral scholarships when I never applied to the doctoral programme with that University.  The Waikato District Health Board advertised a $5,000 masters research scholarship where the successful candidate was to give a talk to the DHB.  I have repeatedly asked (including under OIA) for the name of the receipient of that scholarship in 2018 because I have a strong suspicion that they did not give the funding to any actual student and instead decided to have a party party party for themselves.  They refuse to supply me with information as to when the student gave their talk to the DHB and where there masters research thesis actually is so that I can see the project that they funded with public money (yeah, right).
