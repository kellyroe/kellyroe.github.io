                              I collated the 'few small chunks' as he...  Affectionately? Refers to them as, here:
                              </p>

                                <p>He was only disparaging of me, always.</p>

                                <p>BEFORE I LEFT AUSTRALIA I sent him this: <a href="./writing\doctoral.pdf"> Over 100,000 words of doctoral thesis.</a> He gave me NO COMMENTS on it.  NOTHING.  NO FEEDBACK.  AND HE WOULD NOT SEND IT OUT TO EXTERNALS.  Years later I get my student records from the ANU and there is  note from him asserting that I sent him 50,000 words (only) and it should be done in 3 months (therefore 3 months more money for the Philosophy Programme for keeping me re-enrolled so he gets more money for supervising me).  If he wanted to see 50,000 words from me (only) he should have asked for my words in 2006.  I wrote at least 100,000 words  by the end 2007 ffs.  I worked on a whole different topic for a f*cking year in 2008.  Then I get back to the ANU and what?  What the hell do they pay you to do?  Worst supervisor ever.  What the f*ck do they pay you for?  The words comprising all the conferences he knew that I was giving talks at.  The write ups of them.  This document is well over 100,000 words.  Plenty of words for the externals to tell me which bits they wanted to see crossed out.  He would not get it out for external examination.</p>

                                    <p>Who did get reports from external examiners?  Anybody?  I don't believe it.  WHERE IS MY DEGREE????</p>

                                <p>When was he going to get me comments on ANY of the work that I had been sending him over the past..  How many years?  He was sending me pre-print work from other people -- and I was writing stuff on it and getting that back to him, and he was disparaging of me only if he even bothered to provide me with feedback at all.  When did he supply me with progress reports?  When is he getting my work out for external examination?</p>

<p>I did not see any of the students with reports from external examiners.  I did not see any students give a public oral defence of their thesis in response to the reports from external examiners.  I do see various others claiming to have PhD's and claiming to have been given employment which involved them claiming to have PhD's, however.  I didn't see Rachel Brown or Nick Southwood with reports from externals.  I didn't see them give an oral defence.  I didn't see Ole.  Jan.  Kim 2.  Drew?  Brant.  Karsten (was bio-chem sending them out)? How about Tory?  She graduted...  Did she?  ..  The other guy who was doing crop science stuff.  Agriculture..  Damn, can't remember his name.  His work get sent out?  When was his public defence?  How about Ben Blumsden?  Campbell Brown?  When did their work go out?  When was their oral defence?  Anybody?  Anybody have any of that, at all?  Amir?  Was Computer Science sending them out?  Anybody, at all?  Katrina?  Good enough for employment with Macquarie.  Did they ever send her thesis out for external examination?  When was her oral defense?</p>

<p>Tahua O'Leary...  I was told that the external examiners accepted the thesis they were sent from him without requesting any changes or alterations to the thesis.  The University would not get his work out for external examination until he had been working on it for how many..  Decades?  And then the external examiners did not find so much as a typographical error?  Not so much as a single misplaced apostrophe?  They couldn't find even 1 reference they thought should be added?  I mean to say it's more likely that they never sent it out for external examination at all than that externals had nothing at all to say.  It's not very psychologically plausible to think that an external examiner wouldn't find something to pick.  To justify their extistence as external.  What happened to or with an oral defence?  When was that scheduled?  The public defence?  What Universities?</p>

<p>Aisling.  Yatzek.  I did not see Holly Lawford-Smith with reports from external examiners, with a scheduled public oral defence.  Did she graduate?  How?  I did not see John Matthewson with reports from external examiners or with a scheduled public oral defence.  Did he graduate?  I did not see Ben Jeffares or Brett Calcott...  I did not see Aiden whatever his last name is.  Adrian.  Any of them.  I didn't see any of the ANU graduate research students with reports of external examiners, I did not see any of them have a scheduled oral defence.  Did any of them actually graduate?  Apparently various of them were given paid employment in Philosophy post-graduation.  Given paid positions that were supposed to have conferred PhD as a pre-requisite.  They were given the paid positions.  But did they graduate, at all?  I mean anybody can pay a couple hundred dollars for a hard-bound book.  I wonder if they have transcripts and what their transcripts say.  I wonder if they have pieces of paper proclaiming them to be doctor for their wall.  I wonder how the visas go...  It just does not make any sense to me, at all.  Do they just apply for positions and for funding and say that they have a PhD?  Does Kim Sterelny actually write them references acknowledging they have done enough work for a PhD?  Or do they just write their own references?  Kim Sterelny won't write me a reference.  Martin Davies wouldn't write me a reference after I wrote the work on delusions based on the summer school scholarship.  THey don't have basic honesty and integrity.  Not so far as I can see.  There's nothing there, at all. </p>

<p>All the non-Australians deported without their qualifications.  Right?  So they keep sending work to the ANU.  Are they still enrolled?  They still paying fees?  How much extra did they have to pay to get their qualification?  They still didn't have public oral defences.  Did they really fly back for graduation?  THen why don't they frame their pictures and put them on their walls?  Of their houses when they aren't employed (e.g., Ben Jeffares), at least?  Because it's a f*cking scammy hoax?  Maybe that's why.  I suppose that makes the very best sense.</p>

<p>I didn't see...  David Bourget, Weng Hong, JC...  Dave Wall...  I didn't see anybody with reports from external examiners.  I didn't see any oral defences.  Did anybody actually graduate?  Not just the philosophy programme...  Physics people...  Santiago.  Stephan.  Richard.  Did they have reports from externals?  Did they have a public defence?  Why wasn't I invited to your public defence, Santiago?  That doesn't sound right to me...  Did you have reports from externals?  Did you have a graduation ceremony?  Why do all these people think they have done enough for PhD -- but not me?  I'm confused, here...  How about Ryan Taylor?  Did he ever graduate?  Something about UQ not giving him a fully funded scholarship place to study MBChB unless they withheld graduation from him...  Something like that.  Did he ever get his PhD?  Did he ever graduate from the Queensland MBChB, for that matter...  How about Karen?  What about Stuart?  Did either of them have external reports.  No public defences.  Graduation ceremonies?  Photos for their wall?  Certificates?  Who says they have done enough for PhD -- but not me?  </p>

<p>Apparently Jacinda gets a fellowship for the book she's going to write.  What about giving people fellowships for the books they've f*cking well written already.  For every year of enrolment etc etc.  Everybdoy has one book in them.  One book per f*cking year, it's supposed to be.  Hurry up.  It's not supposed to be that f*ckign hard.  It's not supposed to be a nobel prize ffs.  It's not supposed to be the capstone on the end of your life.  Give people their PhD when they are over 65 and never will be payrolled.  It's supposed to be the start of your f*cking payroll.  Who the f*ck stole mine, then?  Where did it go?  Oh, Sterelny got it.  The f*cking psychopath.  Get out, mate.  F*ck of.  As it would say.  It f*cked the dog, mate, f*cking c*nt.  Real eloquent, isn't he?  Anybody who knows him knows what I say to be true.  'Haha what are you going to do abuot it you and whose army haha'.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

<p>Kim Sterelny had only a small handful of graduate research studnets.  He had no teaching.  He only had to supervise our work to completion.  ANd he takes and he takes and he takes and he takes and he takes.  And he won't (else can't) talk about any of his work that was done more than about 5 years ago.  Likely becuase..  He doesn't understand it.  He probably wasn't the author of it, at all.  I wonder if Frank Jackson was.  Or how or why he's saying that he's co-authoring various things with Kim Sterelny.  It just doesn't make any sense at all.</p>

        <p>Now they aren't even grading things properly, anymore.  Instead of the `yay' and `boo' theory of morality (for people who don't have a sense of morality) we have a `yay' and `boo' theory of academic merits.  We pick the ones we want on non-academic grounds and attribute or assign the grades accordingly.  Grades don't mean anything anymore becuase they aren't grading anything properly anymore.  I don't know if it matters what grades the 2nd or 3rd or 4th year students assign, at any rate, since the university administration changes their grades.  On the basis of...  I don't know... Whose psychopathic kid has been picked out, all special, to be the next Dr Leeks. </p>

        <p>What Universities?</p>

        <p>John Fraser pretends to be too f*cking stupid to calculate a GPA.  Worse, he can't even / won't even follow along once it's been pointed out to him.  How's you vaccine research coming along, John?  How many decades does it take (you) to develop  vaccine?  Best and the brightest, he was.  Clearly.  Picked out all special-like.  What Universities?  They can't even / won't even process applications to enrol.  Progression through training.  They aren't even trying to be fair, at all.  There's nothing there, hey.  F*cking dark ages.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>
