                                <a href="https://kellyroe.github.io/publish/cv050124.pdf">CV last updated 05/01/24</a>


                            </p>

                            <p>I have provided clickable links to how I calculated my GPA.</p>

                            <p>It is relevant because the `Universities' of NZ say that entry to Medicine is `competitive' or `selective' on the basis of GPA, primarily, but they really are not selecting candidates on this basis.</p>

                            <p>The `University' of Auckland advised me to complete a new qualification from a NZ University for purposes of eligibility.  They said that if I completed a 120 point MPhil from the University of Waikato then my grades would come from previous qualifications that I had already completed.  This is because the MPhil (like the PhD) is not a graded qualification.  So completing a `higher research degree' does not alter your GPA.  </p>

                            <p>It turns out that the Education and Training Act says that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years (as I had) are eligible to be enrolled in the programme that they have applied to.  I applied to study Medicine, therefore I was eligible to study Medicine.  I didn't need to do a new qualification for the purposes of eligibility.</p>

                            <p>But they still won't get the theses out to external examiners.  They send them out for the wrong qualification (e.g., requesting `doctoral reports' to be written of a under 50,000 words masters thesis submission).  They won't allow externals to sign off on completion.  They won't get the updated thesis back to externals so as to prevent their signing off on qualification completion.  When the only examiner based outside Australasia says to schedule an oral defence they still won't do it.</p>

                            <p>The entire time I was at the Australian National University I did not see any doctoral candidate with reports from external examiners.  I did not see any doctoral candidate with a scheduled oral defence.  I did not see anybody with a doctoral gown for doctoral graduation.  How is it that others are claiming to have PhD's from that institution when I didn't see any evidence of anybody having reports from externals or oral defences or graduation ceremonies e.g., celebrations around University House.</p>

                            <p> How can they claim to have an education and training system when they are expediting people into Medicine (for example) when they have little to no educational background at all while refuse to acknowledge GPA's that they have awarded?  How is it that my qualifications are supposed to be obsolete and expired while various Judges or University academics well over the age of 65 (the age of retirement) just keep on getting paid and will not get out.</p>

                            <p>
                            There is nothing there.  Hey.
                            </p>

                            <p>Why pay anybody to teach at University when you can just get them to break out into small groups and pretend to teach each other.  Play school.  Play doctors and nurses.  Why pay anybody to do skilled labor when you can get a studnet to pay the `University' while putting them to `work' passing themselves off as while they pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for re re re re enrolment?  What education and training system?  Why pay anybody to do research when you can just have the people already on payroll (especially if they are past the age of retirement) to take the work from students and re-attribute authorship to their friends or even themselves?  There is nothing there, hey.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  Few more crumbs for Sterelny, then?  You pay peanuts and expect them to behave indistinguishably from monkeys.  The prevention and prohibition of social development programme.  The prevention and prohibition of social mobility.  THey aren't behaviourally modern.  Will not treat them as such.  What people do you see?    </p>

                            <p>Sterelny invited all his students (except me) to his 60th birthday party considerably more than 5 years ago, now.  Why does he still have an ANU email address?  He's supposed to be retired.  Time to get out. Why is Justice Toogood still on payroll?  He's had more than 45 years of government payroll for himself, already.  Highly lucrative government payroll as Judge of the High Court.  Time to go Justice Toogood.  Go start yourself a start-up, or something.  Put to use the knowledge that you've gained to be financially independent, for a change, instead of dependent on government payroll.  You've had your turn. Time to get out.  Time to appoint a new Judge.  One who isn't part of your old boys club who is less inclined to cover for the old boys.  Huh.  Why it is that they won't get out.  Removal from office is obsolete, apparently.  They want for things to be done the good old fashioned way. Only over their dead bodies.  What judiciary?  What health system?  What education system?  There doesn't seem to be anything there.  Not even trying to be fair at all, hey.  </p>
