 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">

                            <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/300882327/two-men-found-guilty-of-raping-and-filming-abuse-after-meeting-woman-at-takapuna-beach  Awwwww.  What a lovely, romantic story.  I'm sure once they've been convicted NZ will get busy busy busy erecting statues and monuments in their honor and Australia will grant them rights of citizenship and lucarative paid positions in Australia to continue on their good works when it comes to the people of Melbourne.  That's how we do -- right?  What you have to do to earn acknowledgement for your good works in Australia.  Not anything any differnet than what Dr Leeks would have done.  Everybody aspires to be like him.  Right?  So motivating and inspiring he was...  Most highly valued person on government payroll.  Promoted to Australia for his good works... </p>

                            <p> https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/auckland-ferry-building-attack-city-leaders-slam-police-response-to-barbaric-group-assault/FKIVANATRJDY5NVH54HGLTGEXU/  How many of these people (doing the kicking and diversion of people trying to intervene) were themselves on government payroll?  Volunteering their time to the government cause in order to be early parolled etc?  Not even trying to be the developed world at all.  Faces on cameras.  Faces on cameras.  These are the things that are business as usual in NZ.  This is the face of the government.  This is the government . What governmetn?  What police?  What universities?  What lawyers?  There's nothing here. </p>

                            <p>Awwww.  IIIIIIII KNoooooooooow.. eeeeeevery body has at least one book in them.  One book that htey can find from someone else to steal and then pass off in their own name.  But how many people are endless sources, endless springs of productivity?  Oooooooh  aawaaaw I knowwwww I'm gaaaaarbage garbage gaaaaarbage.  Of course I am.  With all of the people who are employed to help me produce high quality research outputs in the normal time.  Is it any wonder the quality of my work???  All of the people working so very hard to throw my work away and discredit me and undermine me and stabotage me..  Is it any wonder that there really isn't anything ain NZ at all.  Cannibals.  Chewing and gnawing each others arms off only.  It's sooooooooooo cmopetitive.  Sooooooooo competitive.  Australia doesn't have research output it's sooooo cmopetitive.  Who can command the most slaves?  reappropriate their work for ones own?   Soooooooooo cmpetitive there's actually nothing there.  Garbage dump of a f*cking wasteland.  Cry cry cry cry cry for submarines.  Not in the next 15 years.  Build your f*cking own.  Awwww stupid retarded children of inbred elite can't do it.  Awwwwwwww.</p>

                            <p>It wasn't that long ago that they were reporting that the payment or ticketing systems or whatever that were installed in the front of the buses were randomly blowing up and injuring the drivers.  So, of course, nobody will voluntarily work as a bus driver, then.  Because it isn't really a job at all it's just yet another NZ governmetn institution of abuse.  Putting you in a situation wehre something will blwo up and unjure or main you.  And ACC won't get it. Of course.  So, anyway, now the buses also trains are just randomly not turning up.  So people can't get to work / study.  Because they need to be re re re re re re re enrolled without pay.  Else they didndt' even turn up to work.  So I guess they won't get pay checks anymore..  But they'll turn up for who knows how many days weeks moths years before they give up and go away.  Because we never were going to pay them. Because there's actually nothing here.</p>

                            <p>Hillary Barry isn't a sports reporter -- right?  She is a 'television personality' the way that what's her name..  Born in south africa educated in england moves to NZ on the back of her husband's career only for NZL to not acknowledge his qualifications and proclaim you NZer of the year for the con-munications work you've done in microbiolgoy telling the NZ people that the studnets working in your lab don't wear face masks when working with infectious organisms and neither should they..  WHen that microbiology media personality...  Anyway..  Hillary Barry is not actually a sports media person.  Right?  Or maybe the idea is that the people do to 'playschool' or whatever might like to show the kids something about soccer..  So they get some film footage of the field.. But mostly they get tickets to all the events because they are part of NZ media, somehow..  No media cards for NZ journalists. What is that about?  I guess it is about (1) freedom of speech so that you can write articles without the government imprisoning you because they don't like what you have to say also (2) you not being required (you required not to) disclose your sources.  So when the judge asks you to disclose your source of information (on threat of torture) you don't.  Because you are media.  Like the attorney-client privaledge or not being required to testify against your marriage partner.  NZ doesn't have media.  No such thing.  No doctors.  No lawyers.  No media.  There isnt' anything here.  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camp land.  The only leaders for NZ that foreign leaders will acknoweledge.  APparently foreign leaders are too f*cking stupid to parse the Autralian Constitution.  That's how f*cking stupid they are.  Go figure.</p>

                            <p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballantyne%27s_fire  41.  There we go.  Glory days.  Pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for government researchers to document the crimes.  </p>

                            <p>https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/on-air/heather-du-plessis-allan-drive/audio/melissa-nightingale-herald-reporter-on-the-loafers-lodge-court-appearance/  I think the UN / international agencies need to send someone out to see what is going on.  I would suppose that what is happening is that the accused is being held in conditions the UN inspectors would likely say amount to torture.  Being involuntariliy drugged with mind-altering substances (e.g., LSD being manufactured in Auckland with the purpose of being given to people to help with 'anxiety' and various things that have been obtained in the name of veteranary science).  I would imagine they are trying to force confession in order to scapegoat this man.  Draw attention away from the fact that people on GOVERNMENT PAYROLL TURNED OFF THE FIRE ALARMS SO THE FIRE ALARMS WOULD NOT SOUND.  They go wah wah wah wah wah nobody would have heard them sound anyway.  We will never know.  Murdered in state care.  The government paid various people on payroll at some institution they chose to call 'loafters lodge' to turn off the f*cking fire alarms and set the place on fire.  Now this guy is being scapegoated.  The UN and international inspectors need to come in right now.  Drug test this man.  What drugs are they finding in his system while he is being kept in conditions of torture in state care.  The NZ government could not be any more corrupt.  F*cking psychopaths.  There is nothing here.
                                
                            </p>

                            <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/bay-of-plenty/132094916/tiny-home-troubles-in-whakatne-council-rules-criticised  Oh come on.  Dude.  Don't you understand the Kiwi way? Murder death kill!  Murder death kill!  Murder death kill!  Off to a government instituion of abuse for you!  Murder death kill!  Murder death kill!  Murder death kill!</p>

                            <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/490221/meatworks-fined-280-000-over-health-and-safety-failures  Wow.  $50,000 NZD to the applicant.  That probably won't cover the costs of the schedule costs together with the legal fees.  In other words, the person who was wronged by the government (for working a job where people did not folow basic health and safety laws) must pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for the governments failures and the governments crimes.  Quickly quickly quickly identify all the students given overseas scholarships to study and cut their hands off!!! Hands off our slaves!!!!</p>

                            <p>Okay, I'm sorry. The news report said the person who has been accused of setting the fire has 'tried' to sack his lawyer.  I just wanted to check..  He was actually able to sack the f*cking lawyer -- right?  The only lawyer the government would appoint do defend him.  Right?  The lawyer who, no doubt, told him could either plead guilty else not guilty -- by reason of insanity.  Could etiher to go to a forensic psychiatric institution else a non-forensic prison institution.  You choose. My way or the highway.  There is no alternative.  That kind of sort of a lawyer.  Only ones NZ would acknoweldge actually graduated.  Only ones given the payroll to work for the government etc.</p>

                            <p>So... In NZ they massively over-prescribe medication that is out of patient therefore cheap.  For example, doing everything they can to massively overprescribe vast amounts of out of patient old generation anti-psychotics in spite of (or likely because of) their known side-effects of Parkinsons and Parkinsonian-like symptoms.  Why!!! Give me a medal for my obvous research finding that NZ is massively over-prescribing old generation anti-psychotics in order o have very very very very high rates of Parkinsons and Parkinsonian like symptoms.  Give us more money for researching Parkinsons and Parkinsonian like symptoms.  Free prescriptions!!! I mean...  Let's be clear.. The NZL governmetn was going to send the bill to the victims.  The victims could pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for the old generation anti-psychotic presriptiosnt that were killing them with Parkinsons and Parkinsonian like symptoms.  Never stop paying never stop paying never stop paying for the criems of the government.  Ooooooh.  You're going to waive the prescription costs..  But not the legal costs involved in holding the NZ government accountable for it's crimes.  Can't / wont' process applications to medicine.  can't / wont' sign off on completion of training.  Can't / wont' publically advertise jobs.  Can't / won't empoy people competent to practice.  Dr Leeks is the only game in town.  It isnt' like he was doing anything any differnt from waht anybody else acknoweldged as graduate would be doing.  Overtaken bky taken over by psychopaths.  Only game in town.  There's nothing here.  Says the only ARC funded researchers of Australia.  You're f*cking welcome.  Science con-munications at it's best / worst.  Only game in town.</p>

                            <p>Oh. Also...  So the Government prosecutors have gone after a vulnerable target telling them they need to plead 'guilty by reason of insanity' is they are to have any compassion shown by the court to them at all (that's what they told the person they locked up as the Christchurch terrorist -- right?  Instead of giving him a fair trial they tried to force him to confess else they were going to torture him and so on...)...  What right to a fair trial, in NZ.  NZ won't extradite kim.com so he can have a fair trial in the US.  Rather, NZ wants to be a prison camp for kim.com and he can pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the courts of NZ to not have a fair trial in the US.  The NZ courts are okay with that.  Can't find reason in the federal laws of Australia to deport him.  He can refile and refile and refile and pay and pay and pay the courts of NZL to not have a fair trial in the USA.  The leaders of NZ decide to try and profit off those charged with criminal offences in the USA.  Detention camp.  There's nothing here.</p>

                            <p>When the world's media was reporting alleged abuses against the Uyghur people in China and most of the world was saying that what was going on was unacceptable...  The NZ government...  Instead of saying 'these are allegations that need to be looked into because if they are true then something needs to be done because this is not acceptable'...  The NZ governmetn was the only government in the world that was saying 'we grant that these are true and we don't have any problem with it.  It isn't anything different from what it is that we aim and aspire to do as governmetn of NZL'.  That's the truth of the situation.  I don't know what was going on with the Uyghur people in CHina.  I don't know how much the Chinese Government accepted what was going on or condemned it or..  I don't know.  What I do know is the attitude of the NZL government.  They were not questioning the truth of the allegations, they seemed to accept the truth of the allegations.  But they themselves seemed only to aspire to comparable crimes.  Not condemn them as crimes.  Clearly nobody expects NZL to have the miltary might to stand up to China in that kind or sort of way.  What is surprising is that NZL doesn't think that the only game they are actually entitled to play (that htey could actually be a contender for) is the moral high ground.  No.  Rather, NZL aspires only to identify the worst and aim to new lows.  Not even trying to be fair.  </p>

                            <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/132085866/man-charged-over-fatal-loafers-lodge-fire-tries-to-sack-lawyer  Police are not looking at anybody else.  People are looking at other people. Which is it?  When the Jury asks 'did you look into anybody else' the police say 'yes'.  It wasn't that the police decided who had done it based on who was the easiest scapegoat.  They actually investigated multiple suspects.  No.  They just went after the easiest scapegoat.  Person of no fixed abode.  How recently was the lodge paid money from the government precisely for the purposes of housing person of 'no fixed abode'?  The lodge got paid how much to house someone (likely with history of arson) thinking they could provoke him into setting a fire (or blame or set him up for having lit one) so they can collect the insurance.  Right?  That's how we do?  Who was responsible for turning the fire alarms off so they wouldn't sound?  What does the police investigation say about that?  Whose responsibility was it to ensure they were functional (report them if they werent')?  The lawyer is not competent because he wont' accept any plea other than 'guilty' or 'not guilty by reason of insantity?"  they won't accepted medical expert testomony as to the accused mental state by anybody other than someone who says they need to be fed LSD non-prescrptions in the name of medical treatment for their delusions arising from the fact they chose to plead 'not guilty'.  SOunds like the state of psychiatry also law also education also government in NZL.  I guess they are all upset about the fact that it got less than 10.  Better luck with the next death camp.  Maybe you can get 100 or more.  Right?</p>

                            <p>TECH RANT</p>

                            <p>Okay, so...  I got an Apple Watch.  Because my sister got one and said it was great, and my niece got one and said it was great...  Anyway... I ended up getting an apple watch.  I was lucky that I purchased an SE II phone and then (I'm not kidding) the VERY NEXT DAY they annouced the launch of the SE III.  So...  I emailed them and said 'oh noes, I did not see that coming.  Can I get an SE III instead?' and they said 'our price went up and if you will pay the price increase -- of course!'  So I ended up with an SE III at launch (I meant to say).  An apple phone with all of the software support, many years of longevity that that ensues...  So...  I got an Applie Watch.  Because I'm not much into phones (hence the SE phone decision).  And...</p>

                            <p>In many respects I prefer the watch.  I like how it notifies me subtly and not invasively when my phone is ringing or when an email arrives.  I like how it is not intrusive.  I think that it is perfect for reliable and subtle notification.  The thing with the phone is that if you aren't holding it in your hand then you don't notice it.  Else, if you are going to stuff it in your bag you need to set the notification on very loud.  So it becomes either very intrusive else it doesn't notify you at all.  Because the watch is conveniently located on your wrist it is a reliable indicator.  And you can turn the signal strength well down so you reliably get the message in a way that you can legitimately choose what to do with it.  It doesn't f*cking broadcast to everyone that you got a message that you should attend to (else you don't attend to your messages)..  It's pretty great in that respect, actually.</p>

                            <p>So, then, what are expectations on time-keeping devices?  Well. Tell the f*cking time.  Shouldn't really have to say that, I would have thought.  Does it do it?  Yes, I think it does.  It has an 'always on' display that is doing something subtle that I don't really understand.  I think it is some combination of a dim screen shot of time on last awaken and then when you gesture your arm (move it towards your face) it will awaken (screen brighten) and it updates the time.  You can tell that the time is 'live' then because the second hand is moving.  For times when you want an accurate time.  Which is not actually very often (considering how very very very very many points it is available during the day).  I mean to say there isn't really any point in the watch displaying the time -- when you aren't looking at it to tell you the time.  Of course.  Yeah.  Of course.  It's actually very smart in ways people probably didn't really think that it would need to be...</p>

                            <p>It is a feat of microelectronics.  Microengineering.  It's f*cking tiny.  They packed a battery in there and so on.  It's pretty amazing.  When you see the tear-downs.  The engineering that went into manufacturing them.  Minraturisation.  Yeah.  Amazing.  </p>

                            <p>So then.. Extension of time-keeping.  Calendar.  I expect it to have functioning and functional calendar.  Yes.  I do.  I think that is the obvious next move.  Now... I KNOW THAT I DID..  I KNOW THAT I DID..  Schedule the Diablo 4 server slam into my i calendar.  Google calendar.  To synch with my phone and watch.  And I set my watch to have 'next event' notifiacation.  ANd when it works i'ts f*cking amazing.  PDA device of hte future.  It's wonderful.  It tells you when your next event is scheduled for (the way it tells you the time).  ANd you can set notifiacations so that it tells you when it is time to start getting ready (e.g., if you want 1 hour to get ready at home before leaving) or whatever.  You can set alarms associated with the event.  So that you start getting ready on time.  So you leave the house in time.  Stuff like that.  When it works well.  When it works well...  You can schedule an event (Diablo Server Slam) in Pacific Daylight Time and it will notify you 10 minutes before the event starts when you are located in NZL.  Right?  Right?  Am I right?  No..  Uh..  The event mysteriously disappeared from my calendar entirely . I think we are not quite there yet.  You also can't set your own alarms before the event (e.g, I want 8 minutes notifiation because I reckon it will take me 8 minutes to get there and apple watch confers on my walking speed so let me choose what kind of lead time I want reminders for on the events I've scheduled.  Also..  Let me nest events.  If I want to schedule 5 days of conference and however many talks within the conference schedule don't tell me there is a conflict between my attending conference generally (a thematic event if you will) and particular talks that have been scheduled through conference.  Let me schedule attending a Ballet and maybe playing a few hours of Zelda during a 24 hour server slam.  I can schedule breaks during event.  Conflicts aren't fatal...  Let people schedule things more...  Nest events (e.g., thematic events that go for days)  Yeah...  It isn't quite there yet...</p>

                            <p>I'm still trying to figure how to harvest my own data from the watch.  I know it is a prototype device, really.  Rather than fully functional at launch.  Be honest about that then adn though.  I guess politics...  Nobody wants people to be clear when they are on work time vs when they are on personal time.  When tehy are speaking or posting or being in a personal capacity vs a paid work capacity.  Slaves!!!  No such thing as not -work time.  WE own you.  It would be a conflict for you to schedule any events or meetings or anything at all while you are 'at work'.  Irrevokable irremediable conflict.  Nothing can be scheduled while you are 'at work'.  Not on your home or personal devices.  Of cousre  When do you take your work devices off?  Un-emplant the microchips?  WHy oh why oh why would anybody think that they only microchip peole's prized pets?  Of the animal variety, I mean.  Why oh why oh why wouldn't they be microchipping people?  I mean think abou it for half a sec...</p>

                            <p>I guess it does have something to do with political pressure.  Not wanting people to be clear about work time vs personal time.  Stealing people's personal lives.  Keeping of slaves.</p>

                            <p>THE POINT (I'm getting there, I'm getting there)</p>

                            <p>Slightly (?) facesiously?  Is that the word?  I don't know..  What are the reasonable time-keeping or management functions that could be expected of the Apple watch 8 that I purchased?  What is the cost of the horn or whatever it was saddle mounted trophy that people got for reaching level 20 and killing the boss who spawned only on 3 hourly spawn schedules?  I missed the f*cking spawn times until the very very very very last spawn time because Apple watch didn't f*cking notify me of the start of the f*cking server slam time.  And then I sucked.  Maybe they nerfed my class or my build or maybe I suck (probably the latter) but the point is that I could have likely would have figured it out if I had more time to participate in teh event.  Which I couldn't because I trusted the f*cking watch to tell me when the even was going to start..  And it didn't.  So I thought the slam didn't start until Sunday morning (for me my time) but that was wrong....  ANyway..  Who is going to sue Apple over the loss of the irreplacable Diablo trophy mount?  Not me...  But someone should..  Just saying...  Yeah.  A sort of prototype suing tehm of what happens when..  I don't know.  INsert your favorite 'oops I missed it' moment there at the most massive amount of cost you can think of.  Because???  Apple.  If anybody has shoulders broad enough to figure it out...  Welome.  Thanks.  Pay me later.  Yeah, right.</p>

                            <p>END TECH RANT</p>

                            <p>When I was subcontracted to Macquarie, or Jeannette, really, to do 1 x 2 hour lecture and 1 tutorial for her every week (the course requirement was only for 2 hours of lecture and 1 tutorial per week) for 12 or maybe it was 13 weeks of the semester...  She got an ARC research grant to study psychopathy.  That was what she was paid to do research on.  Previously Martin Davies was given an ARC grant to to research on delusions.  The ARC was giving philosophy people money to do research projects in philosophy of psychopathology, you see.  Dave Chalmer's made a bit of a name for himself going on about zombies.  Philosophical zombies.  Rather than hollywood zombies.  People went on to me, during my time at the ANU, about psychopaths, a lot.  About pschopathy.  There is quite the philosophical and scientific literature on psychopathy.  Modelling how 'tit for tat with reciprocal bias' loses when one or two cheaters and defectors or psychopaths come into the situation and decmiate the local community.  Going on about how co-operation couldn't possibly evolve.  There can't be any.  Can't be any such thing.  No ethics.  No morality.  Everything has been taken over by psychopaths.  The Autralian Government was paying people to to research or write up about how psychopaths, psychopaths, psychopaths, so far as the eye could see.  Noramlise it, I guess.  Like how some people were paid really rather a lot to normalise things that juries tend to find deviant.  Dr Leeks experiments or observational studies or whatever.  To normalise that sort or kind of thing.  NOrmalise PRofessor Glue's Glue Factory.  It isn't like anybody was doing anything different to what Dr Green was trained to do -- right?  Psychopaths.  Psychopaths.  Psychopaths so far as the eye can see... </p>

                            <p>I think she wanted me to do a literature review for her, too.  At one point I was like...  Uh...  There is a lot of material out there I don't really see how to do one..  And, um...  She was paying me by the hour was she?  To do her research...  Subcontracting her research grant too, I suppose.  Taking hundreds and hundreds of thousands for herself (like Martin Davies did to work on delusions) and then take work from me.  Martin was going on about delusions being modelled as perceptual problems.  Like hallucinations.  My contribution was to focus on the affect side of things.  After which he wrote up some stuff with his wife focusing on the motivational side of things.  To link to motor output systems.  Anyway...  The worst of it was about him not writing me a reference for the work that I did for him.  He didn't actually encourage me to apply to the ANU -- but he was leaving for Oxford, at any rate, so if I had have applied there to have studied with him he would have moved away, anyway.   No point trying to work with particular people they just ship them around intentionally to tell the research studnets they need to start over again, start over again, just do another thesis now.  Just one more thesis.  Hey why don't you do all of your supervisors research so that they can get hundreds of thousands of dollars to party party party and just hand them all your work so they can submit it as their own with a new skin on it.  Corruption.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>But that is why I go on about psychopaths.  Because they went on and on and on about psychopaths to me.  Telling me that they were psychopaths.  They had taken over the university and there wasn't anything of any value left there.  All of the money for them to keep slaves.  </p>

                            <p>__</p>

                            <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/300883074/man-due-in-court-this-morning-charged-with-arson-after-deadly-loafers-lodge-fire  They have charged someone with 'arson', already.  Not looking at prosecuting anybody else, already.  Not prosecuting for manslaughter.  Not prosecuting for murder.  I think if you are committing a crime (e.g., arson) and someone dies then that is enough to convert manslaughter into murder regardless of intent.  I thought that was the way that that went.  But the Judge would have to instruct the Jury on that.  I guess what is likely (given that this is NZ and all) is that one person has been picked out to be scapegoated.  How much money does Loafers Lodge management get out of the insurance company for subcontracting out the destruction component or part of their rebuild?  I think that was why people wanted to miswire heaters.  The idea was to collect the insurance money.  Like how people want to have emergency accommodation slums so that they can provoke and blame the tenants for meth contamination and holes in the walls etc etc.  Get the government to pay out for new carpet and paint and so on.  Quite the market to mis-manage the hostages.  People kept in state care.  That's what is going on when the government redirects money away from the person to people on government payroll to keep them.  Right?  When the rent money goes from the government to the accommodation provider rather than to the person to be detained in the accommodation.  Interesting that a former prisoner says that he's being kept by the government in, effectively, a prison institution.  Institutional care.  Setting of the fire alarms until they turn them off because of the number of false alarms.  So that then it's easy to blame one of the arsonists they intentionally chose to install in the building to do the 'work' for which they don't even pay him.  How to breed a terrorist?  Right, Jacinda?  Isn't that the aim purpose point or goal of the NZ government?  To pay and pay and pay and pay and pay managers of outfits like these to keep people hostages in State care institutions.  We don't have a skilled workforce.  We don't have any people.  Right?  NO people.  I don't see any people.  Do you see any people?  What people?  What skilled workers?  What work?  What judiciary?  What university?  What research output?  
                                

                            </p>

                            <p>I applied to ANU last year to see how they would handle  my appication.  They declined it on grounds that my application was 'incomplete'.  Said I didn't supply a writing sample.  But they had 3 writing samples from me on file, already, that they used to offer me a summer research scholarship and then enrolment in their PhD programme. In fact, they also have evidence of a more than 100,000 word thesis that I supplied to my supervisor and the univesrity administration...  That they never sent me any comments on and they never got out to externals for external examination.  My application to enrol was not incomplete.  They just open their face holes and garbage falls out.  It's hard to see people when they don't behave..  What's that, Sterelny?  No evidence of behavioral modernity at all.  3 Writing samples from me on file already.  That were already acknowledged as having been received by the ANU.  Sterelny refuses to write me a reference.  For all the work I've done that he refuses to acknowledge.  Martin Davies refuses to write me a reference.  For all the work that I did on the project he was paid hundreds and hundreds and thousands of dollars of Australian research funding to work on.  He hires a post-doc from MIT and me as a summer research scholar.  I hand them over my work.  THey won't even supply me with a reference.  MIT declines my application to there so quickly it was like a script prevented it from even going to the department.  I'm remembering applying for a post-doctoral fellowship at Macquarie and telling them that I've got my thesis draft to my supervisor waiting for him to commetn on it / get it out to externals for external examination.  I was never even informed by MacQUarie that my application for post-doc was not successful.  I guess someone just threw it away in order to give the job to someone else.  Rachel, was it?  Probably.  Probably was Rachel at that point.  I remember being happy for her that he got some job...  Because I am not a psychopath.  Where is the credit for my PhD?  I remember sending two of my writing samples to a journal.  PPP.  I submitted them to the journal for publication . YOu aren't supposed to submimt them to be published anywhere else while you are waiting to hear if a journal is going to be publishing your work.  SO everything is held up.  For how many years do you wait?  YOu know..  I never did hear anything back from the Journal.  PPP never told me that they didndt' consider my articles good enough for publication.  More than a decade later I publish them on my own f*cking website.  F*cking psychopaths.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  What research output?  There's nothing there.  Nobody home.  Send out invitations to people and tell them what you want them to say.  F*cking garbage.  I don't see any f*cking people at all.  What people?  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                            

                           <p>Australasian Universities aren't functioning as Universities.  They aren't properly processing applications to enrol.  They aren't properly acknowledging progression through training.  They aren't employing people to supervise studnets, get their work out to external examiners, allow externals to sign the students off when their work is at the requisite standard.  They aren't graduating the studnets.  Keeping them re re re re re enrolled for more and more and more and more money for the University.  I've put some of my academic work up on this site.  I didn't start out overly or overtly political but they wouldn't process or progree my work.  I was supposed to just keep handing over more and more and more work, oh, and taking out more and more and more debt to the University so that they could have pay increases for themselves while they don't do the job for which they are paid.  I think the journals etc are just scams, basically.  Indefinately hold up publication until the people are bullied into leaving so they can reattribute authorship to people on payroll.  I don't know that the people they chose to say graduates had their theses externally examined or if they paid bribes or whatever to the University in exhange for them saying they'd done enough for their qualification completion.</p>

                           <p>Australasia doesn't really seem to have functioning or functional health system, education system, judiciary.  They didn't enrol, acknowledge progression through training, graduate, employ people willing and or able to do those kinds of jobs.  There doesn't really seem to be anything there.</p>

                           <p>The Australian Constitution says that NZ is a State of Australia.  It is named a State of Australia.  The second original state after NSW.  But Australia won't give Australian passports or birth certificates to people who were born in NZ.  Won't process applications for enrolment in certain qualifications. Won't supply federal voting papers.  Won't process applications for certain government jobs.  Who arranges for New Zealand Currency to be printed in...  Canada?  To disguise just how low NZ wages are kept.  To prevent travel and the like.  New Manus Island.  Prison camp.  Detention camp.  Keeping slaves.  Treating the students as their property.  More and more and more and more money for more and more and more enrolment.  Not doing the job for which they are paid.  I guess the reason why they pay CHris Whelan hundreds of thousands of dollars per year is because he has the statutory function of processing complaints of wrongdoing.  He has used his position to refuse to process any complaints of wrongdoing.  Una Jagose has used her position to obstruct justice and order evidence to be hidden and thrown away (her role in the abuse in NZ government care inquiry).  Reappointing retired judges back on payroll so they can see nothing wrong (Justice Toogood was recently appointed not by proper process).  Not even trying to do any of the things they are on payroll to do.  Seemingly on payroll precisely only because they are unwilling and or unable to do any of the things they are supposedly paid to do.  Upside down stupid-f*cking land.</p>

                           <p>
                               ______________
                           </p>

                           <p>I did my undergrad in Philosophy and Psychology and my Full-Time GPA (according to Univesrity of Auckland published algorithm) over my 4 year undergrad + honors years is 8.6 (out of a possible 9.0),  That is to say, somewhere between an A and an A+.  I wanted to apply to study for PhD in the USA because I wanted to do 2 more years of course-work and have a broader breadth and depth to my knowledge before writing a 3 year thesis.  I was told that I should enrol in a Masters Degree, then, and write a research thesis while I was applying to the US.  So I enrolled in a 120 point only Masters Research Qualification (Research Masters are only 120 points or 1 year or 1EFT qualifications for students who have already completed their Honors Year).  I got a summer research scholarship to the ANU and worked with Professor Martin Davies over the summer on his Australian Research Council funded project on 'delusion'.  That was how I started working on that topic.  He told me not to apply to Australia for PhD and the US for PhD at the same time because if I accepted offer of place to Australia and then the US said they wanted me then I would need to reneg on the Australian place which would mean they would be out of funding for a student since it would be too late for them to then give the place they offered to me to someone else.  So I held off applying to Australia (on Martin Davies Advice) and he did not supply a reference to me at the end of the SUmmer.  He said 'ask the people back home who will rave about you'.  I didn't get accepted to the 2 US Universities I applied to.  Cornell and MIT.  Cornell didn't let me know that my application had been declined.  I contacted them more than 3 months later and got a letter from one of their former employees who had moved to Harvard (the person I named as potential supervisor) to reassure me that my application had been forwarded to the department and processed.  They didn't just take my $80 US application fee and then not even process my application to Cornell at all!  She reassured me.  It was just that they didn't send me a letter to let me know that I hadn't been offered a place.  That was their only ommission. </p>

                           <p>The University of Waikato people encouraged me to apply for an extension to my Masters thesis work.  I think that was how it went.  Retrospectively.  They said that I could do more teaching for them if I was still enrolled as a student with them.  I could still have my University library access and access to office space.  Still live in University accommodation.  I don't quite remember how that went.  I do remember that nobody from Waikato suggested to me that I apply to do a PhD at Waikato since I'd already been working on a Masters Research for one year.   Nobody said 'just get out the work that you have and maybe the external examiners will suggest that you keep working on it as a doctoral thesis...  Or maybe they will say that you have done enough for a Masters thesis in one year...  Take a gap year..  Apply for jobs in something other than Philsoohpy..  If you want to do Medicine then apply to Auckland now, on the back of your current GPA...'  Nobody said anything like that.  All the people on University payroll for student support services and the like..  My supervisor..  Various people in the Philsophy Department...  They just encouraged me to take our re-enrolment in the 1 year Masters qualification.  Taking 2 years to do 120 points of work means I'm dropping back to part-time status.   How much teaching work was I doing at that time?  I think I was doing a lot, actually...  They will fill up the grad studnets with tutoring and grading and teaching...</p>

                           <p>I'm thinking of everyone I know who has done a Masters thesis.  With Waikato and Auckland. One person...  She said she ended up taking 2 years.  SHe will get very red in the cheeks and say that it was her fault for slacking...  She started out on one thing and then it turned into something else..  There was some special reason why she needed to take 2x the standard time.  Another person I know said that there was a special reason why he had to take 2x the standard time.  His supevisor was sick and so that's why he wasn't getting him the supervision and so on.  Everybody I know..  All of them.  Every single person has a story about why they were held back from being allowed to complete..  From being expected to complete.  Held back from completing their 1 year of research on time.  Every one of the studnets thinks that it is their fault.  Or their decision.  They take responsibility for why the University didn't look at graduating them for 1 year of research that htey did over 1 year.  They all think that they were lucky to have been allowed to graduate at all.  After being requird to take 2x the standard time.</p>

                           <p>After I didn't get a place in the US I applied to 2 Universities in Australia.  ANU and Macquarie.  ANU told me that Martin Davies was leaving for Oxford but I should make my project sort of broadly applicable to differnet people who might be around to supervise over that time.  Martin Davies refused to write me a reference but he said he would put in a good word for me at or with the ANU.  They offered me a scholarship funded place to study there.  Macquarie did as well.  And Paul Griffiths encouraged me to apply to Queensland.  I said I'd missed the application deadline and he said it didn't matter I should get an application in anyway.  Then I got offered a place at Queensland, too.  Even though I wasn't eligible for that since my application was received late.  They wanted me to write to Queensland and say, then, that I wasn't accepting the place in Queensland because of some political thing..  Paul Griffiths (after having encouraged me to apply to Queensland) turned out to be moving to Sydney anyway.  He didnt' tell me that.  He just encouraged me to apply to Queensland so I could study with him and then it turned out that he wasn't going to be in Queensland, anyway, so if I had have accepted a place in Queensland to study with him I would have ended up in Queensland while he moved to Sydney.  I mean to say.. It looks to me like they move the supervisors around.  WHen it's time to sign their student off or do work supervising their students.  They move them so the studnets can internalise why they need to take more and more and more time.  WHy their work isn't being accepted by the Univesrity.</p>

                           <p>My ANU notes say that Kim Sterelny was named as my supervisor.  He didn't arrive until I'd been there for 6 months.  He didn't email me or anything before he arrived.  I have writing that I did (I've posted it on the seminars page) so you can see the sort of 6,000 word articles that I was writing during my first 2 years at the ANU.  Then I went to North Carolina Chapel Hill for 1 year.  You can see the work I wrote for the Centre For Cognitive Neuroscience when I was auditing one of their graduate level classes (for no credit).  Responding to the course contents for the textbook that the faculty on staff wrote there.  Giving them my written work for course content that I'll not be formally credited with.  I didn't give course work to UNC Chapel Hill. I wasn't sure how that was supposed to go.  Auditing courses for no credit.  Am I to give them written work so they can reattribute authorship to someone else for someoen else to have credit for my work, then?  Is that the idea/l?  I was paid by UNC Chapel Hill to teach 1 course per semester, though (the equivalent of their grad students) and I could attend their courses.  So I could listen to 1 year of leactures and participate in tutorial discussions etc in graduate level courses that are not offered, at all, in Australasia.  With the 3 years (or however many decades)of research only doctoral theses.  THey don't have graduate level coursework.  </p>

                           <p>Then I return to Australia and they don't give me any comments on my written work.  I don't want ot go up to University to have morning tea and afternoon tea and eat my lunch.  So I stop going to University.  I email them my work so there is a record they received it.  There weren't in person meetings.  Check my supervisors email outbox for evidence of supervision.  I don't see any evidence that he did the job for which he was on payroll.  But that was his job -- right?  To get more and more and more money for hte 'university' for keeping hostages re re r er e re re re re re re re enrolled. His slaves a slaving . So he can take their work and reattribute authorship to someone else.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                           <p>So, that's a  nasty business.  I wanted to do Medicine.  Work as a Psychiatrist.  There wasn't anything there in Philosophy, you see.  Psychopaths...  Been taken over by people having soooo much fun taking all the money...  Requiring studnets go on camping trips...  Dinners.  Drinks.  Not processing the work.  Not getting the work to externals.</p>

                           <p>Australia won't allow NZ citizens to take Australian Government Loans to train in certain courses (e.g., Medicine).  NZ studnets are considered local only for some things.  I was given a local scholarship for PhD study.  But wasn't eligible for HELP or HEX (they renamed it aptly, apparently, anyway).  THey are keeping slave prison hostage detention camps.  They don't have a health system.  It's sooooo competitive.  Death camps.  I mean...  Dr Leeks.  Once it started to become publically known the kinds and sorts of things he'd been doing they moved him to Melbourne.  To better facilitate his ongoing crimes.  They intentionally enabled him.  He was most valued employee.  That tells you everything you need to know about Psychiatry.  Medicine generally.  I mean, it's not plausible to think they don't have security cameras up in the OR's etc.  The ED's etc.  But still all these unauthorised people in the OR's and the ED's committing various crimes.  Atrocities.  On government payroll to commite crimes and atrocities.  </p>

                           <p>The wrong people won the war in Australasia.  We know because the atrocities never stopped.  Not even trying to be fair.  It's soooooo competitive, apparently.  There's nothing here.  Psychopaths.</p>

                           <p>They want to say more than 80 per cent of NZ studnets enrolled in 'Degree qualifications' are doing 'vocational degrees'.  What that means is that they do internship after internship after internship after internship while the Government records only increasing levels of debt against their name because they supposedly or allegedly owe the universities for course-fees.  The Universities get money from the government more and more and more and more money for having slaves a slaving on their internships.  It has no inention at all of graduating any of them at all. It is not going to pay any of them at all for doing skilled labor post-graduation.  You can get paid minimum wage to be a 'healthcare assistant' in an 'unskilled capacity' else you can pay and pay and pay and pay the university to do the same job as an unpaid intern with the vauge promise that after however many years of you a slaving they'll graduate you and employ you as a registered nurse. But why would they pay you to work as a registered nurse when they can get you paying the university and slaving the job for free?  Look at all the research work that I handed over to the Univerisity.  MOre and more and more and more research while they record only ever increasing levels of debt against my name.  Look at the research output of all the people on payroll?  Plagarists.  They don't write research output.  They are too busy having morning tea and lunch and afternoon tea and dinner and drinks and going off on camping trips.  Flying around the world to have yakkity yak yaks about reattributing the research output of the slaves to people on payroll who don't even to any of the ethings for which they are paid.  What research output?  What Universities?  What health system? What Judiciary?  There's nothing there.</p>

                           <p>Looking at hte Jobs available in NZ anyone would think the most in-demand job there is is the job that the government advertises and readvertises and readvertises.  For someone to work for the government as a 'recruitment consultant' and record how many hostages they are keeping unemployed or redeployed to voluntary work or slave work.  When it's time to pay the workers it's time to have them deported.  Right?  Locked up in the name of psychiatry (they must be mentally ill if they think they are going to get sign off on completion of training).  There's nothing here.  Garbage dump of a f*cking wasteland.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                           <p>I think Queensland has stopped doing genetic testing because most people's paternity turns out to be problematic.  The increasing number of people turning to 'medical professionals' to help them conceive.  Why would anybody think that they would actually be making viable embryos that are actually the progeny of the people who think they are...  I mean to say...  Wouldn't it be more likely that some f*cking psychopath Medical Doctor (the only one they would have on payroll) was using his own sperm for everything?  Wouldn't that be more likely?  Jacinda announces to the Medical Graduates of Harvard that NZ never prosecuted anybody for wrongful death of a foetus.  We have highest rates of abuse and so on.  What they really want to do is breed knock-out babies..  Try knocking out various genes. In the name of medical research and helping people of course.  But what they are looking for is trying to breed 'angel-man' babies.  Pretty little elven things who you can do anything anything anything to and they will just giggle and smile.  I would imagine they would / could get quite a lot of money for infants like that.  Non-verbal would be best.  Not able to testify against the government or anybody else in a court of law.  Maybe not having the congnitive capacity to understand anything that's going on.  We don't know how lucky we are to be gamma babies.  I would imagine that there would be quite the market for blow-up doll people.  You can do anything anything anything anything to them and they will never communicate about your crimes.  We can keep them in government institutions or sell them in the private market.  NZ is the best place in the world to come and do things like that.  Right, Jacinda?  Nobody was ever prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus.  Nobody was prosecuted for sexually molesting patients when they had been anesthetised for unrelated procedures (they go on about unauthorised cervical exams but implanting embryos and removing embryos when they are viable outside the womb as Fisher and Paykal incubator babies, maybe let's try and see)...  NZ is the best place in teh world to come and live out all of those fantasies (I think the Diablo people would put it like that).  So we can understand the nature of the competition.  The lengths that some people will go to to ensure that the likes of Dr Leeks and Professor Glue are the only game in town.  Why they reappoint judges not via proper process at all (e.g., Justice Toogood was not appointed by proper process).  Una Jagose publically admitted to her role in refusing to prosecute wrongdoing.  Throwing evidence away.  ordering obstruction of justice throwing away evidence.  Corruption.  There are none so blind as those who will not see.  </p>

                           <p>Presumably there isn't anything wrong with the reading comprehension of the leaders of the US and so on.  But who knows.  COrnell doesn't seem capable of processing applications to enrol.  Why do they acknowledge NZ as a country when they can read the Australian constitution?  Where is Jacinda anyway.  Who voluntarily chooses to walk away from her pay cheque?  She can't be employed to teach at Harvard on the back of a 3 year con-munications degree from Waikato, surely.  But then Ashley Bloomfield was re-deployed to University of Auckland Professor when he never applied to PhD, never wrote a doctoral thesis, never was examined for one.  Doesn't have a research output.  He's a medical doctor -- right?  A medical graduate who was acknowledged as graduated.  But they will not register him to see patients and he sees no patients.  That sounds right.  They will never pay him to work the job for which he trained.  They will re-deploy him only to ensure that he takes up a place or position ensuring that nobody works that job, either.  There's nothing here.</p>

                           <p>kim.com should have been extradited to stand trial in the US under Australian Law.  The courts refused to extradite him.  He pays the NZ courts, he pays the NZ courts, he pays the NZ courts.  THey order re re re re re re filing and more and more money to be paid to the NZ courts.  They say NZ doesn't have the laws to extradite him.  Australia does.  But the Federal courts of Australia refuse to acknoweldge or process filings from NZ . They say they don't have jurisdiction because the only people they would put on payroll are too f*cking stupid to parse the Australian Constitution, one can only suppose.  </p>

                           <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/pou-tiaki/132060879/calls-to-make-education-more-affordable-for-pacific-island-students  The University of Waikato was going to hold me indefinately under 'zero fees' (as a MPhil Student).  That's what their award winning in-house counsel (Shelley-Slade Gully) wrote to me.  That the University was going to keep me enrolled under the zero fee scheme until the externals signed off on completion of my qualification (which the University never intended to allow them to do).  They aren't even trying to follow the Statutory law, at all.  NZ Universities were responsible for training and graduating Pacifica Nurses.  Right?  Arranging for them to mix MMR vaccines with expired anasthetic solution and sending them to the Pacific Islands to administer ineffective vaccines that even resulted in wrongful death of infants they were given to.  THey were NZ trained and NZ graduated nurses.  Correct?  Who were trained and graduated and registered and shipped to Samoa to cause wrongful deaths of infants.  THey never would have graduated or registered or employed them otherwise.  Not even trying to be fair.  The Government does not 'subsidise the costs' of domestic studnets.  The government keeps domestic students doing all of the work for none of the money.  Will not sign off on compeltion fo their training.  Will not publically advertise jobs.  Won't follow proper process on employments. </p>

                           <p>THey won't get graduate studnets work out to external examiners.  It doesn't matter how much you pay them -- they just won't do it.  THe number of PhD studnets I know who were required to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay considerable fees in excess.  Considerable time in excess.  They refuse to process their work.  Refuse to get it to externals.  THey just wont' do it.  They'll wrongful death the studnets before they will graduate them.  The f*cking free-rider incompetents on payroll.  WHo don't even have a research output.  Only reason tehy are on payroll to to wrongful f*cking death howevr many others.  F*cking psychopaths.  Not even trying to be fair.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  What research output of the University?  Where is it?  What Univesrity?  Nobody home.  NOthing there.  Not even trying to have an education and training system.  Murder off all the people willing and able to do the f*cking work until you've got your slave prison detention camps.  Ruled over by f*cking incompetents.  Where is the research output?  One f*cking job to do..  Where is your research output??? </p>

Now the commissioner can get busy hiring 2 pedophiles to replace the one they had to let go.  That'll teach them for complaining!  </p>
