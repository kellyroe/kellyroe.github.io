 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>I started this website so that I could upload some of the writing that I have done.  Mostly for Universities.</p>

                                <p>I wanted to go to Medical School and was informed that since my graded work was completed more than 5 years ago I would need to complete a new qualification.  I asked if a 120 point MPhil would suffice and after being advised that it would I enrolled in that and worked towards it.  The University subsequently refused to get my work to externals and then sent the masters thesis out for 'doctoral examination' so as to prevent and prohibit my completing the qualification without being forced to re-enrol for extra-time.  By forcing me to re-enrol for extra-time they could say that I had failed to complete the new qualification in the 'minimum, normal, or standard time', you see.  In other words, by preventing externals from signing off on my qualification completion they stabotaged my application to Medical School. </p>

                                <p>If I hadn't have told them that I wanted to complete the MPhil to go to Medical School then they might have allowed me to complete it.  If I had have cooked up some story about how I really only had 1 year of time to spend on the research and there was just no way that I could keep working on it if it wasn't signed off on in that time.  If I had have been all 'I really don't think I can do it.  Do you think I can?  Do you think I can do 1 year of work in 1 year?  Will you help me?  Then they may have helped me.  If I had have spent my time rallying supporters instead of doing the work, I mean to say.  Maybe they would have just signed me off themselves regardless of what the examiners said (I mean if they can fail me out regardless of what the examiners say they can pass me regardless of what the examiners say) -- right?</p>

                                <p>But then what is the value of a New Zealand University qualification?  What do you want to do with a Medical Degree?  Go into Politics?  Write Law under Urgency?  Talk about how 'group rights' are fundamental rather than 'individual freedoms'.  Is that when the Rights of the Group to percieve justice to be done (the hanging of the lonesome stranger) takes priority over 'individual freedom' to walk out of town unmaimed?  That's what morality looks like in these parts?</p>

                                <p>I suppose the job or role of Medical Doctors, really, is to try and have people feel okay about how there isn't any medical treatment for them.  There aren't any medical supplies.  There aren't any or many trained professionals on staff.  There isn't enough to go around.  There never will be enough for genuine need to be met.  To convey this to the people in a way so they feel accepting and okay about it and like the poor doctors and clinicial staff are doing their very very best and there's just nothing much to be done but accept it.  Take one for the team, and all that.</p>
