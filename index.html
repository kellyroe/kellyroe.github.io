 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container"> 

                            <p>It is great to see NZ has a medical device company in South Auckland to target what might be one of the most vulnerable populations in the world.  Particularly when people in New Zealand do not have the right to opt out or opt off of Medical Experiments.  Do they?  Did that get revoked from our Bill of Rights, yet?  Or are we simply relying (as we usually do) on our Judiciary being unwilling and or unable to uphold any of the laws of New Zealand?  I mean to say, nobody was prosecuted for anything along the lines of 'wrongful death of an infant' when abortion was listed in the crimes act.  Nobody was prosecuted for having performed an abortion even though NZ had one of the highest rates of government paid for abortions performed.  Apparently voluntarily.  Apparently the women were consenting to these procedures being performed as many of them had been non-voluntarily inpregnated in the first place... </p>

                            <p>Anyway, abortion was removed from the crimes act without any public consultation.  Under special conditions of urgency and emergency, one can only suppose.  </p>

                            <p>The Universities of NZ are not processing applications to Medical School according to the objective criterion they publish, supposedly for purposes of their own accountability.  The Judiciary will not uphold the Education and Training Act.  </p>

                            <p>They really just are not even trying to be fair, at all.  </p>

                            <p>Nobody was held to account for WWII atrocities in this part of the world and the atrocities never stopped.  They aren't even trying to be fair at all.</p>

                            <p>It clearly says in the Australian Constitution that NZ is a State of the Federation of Australia.  But the Federal Courts claim that they don't have jurisdiction.  What can you do when the Federal Judges are too f*cking stupid (or something) to parse the constitution they are charged with upholding?  F*cking crazy-land, I tell you what.  There's nothing here.  Not even trying, hey.</p>
