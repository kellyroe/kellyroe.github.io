                                <p>(1)  Apparently the Australian National University are locating my student records and saying something about why I left the ANU without recieving credit for a PhD. I've posted much of my work that was done in 2006, 2007.  Then 2008/9 I spent 1 year at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and my thesis enrolment was put on hold.  Then there's a talk after I returned and a mammoth more than 100,000 word thesis document years later.  Then another 3 part thesis document a year after that.  Why wasn't my 2 years of work bundled off to external examiners?  They had opportunity to assess the quality of my work when I was working for them as summer scholar.  They gave me extensions at some point  -- which suggests the quality was on track.  Or..  Well.  Let's see the file notes.  Let me guess, someone thought I'd  make a nice slave?  Was that the general idea?  The chump from New Zealand?
                                </p> 

                                <p>(2)  The Social Security Tribunal of New Zealand.  Both parties were asked to confirm availablity for a phone conference on 14 July 2022.  I confirmed availability.  To the best of my knowledge the other party has still not confirmed availability and an hearing has not actually been set down.  
                                </p>

                                <p>The University of Auckland informed me that since the last Degree I completed from a NZ University was more than 5 years old I was 'ineligiible' to study MBChB.  They informed me that completing a PhD with the ANU would not count,  because the ANU was not a NZ University.  I asked them specifically whether my completing a 120 point MPhil with the University of Waikato would count for the purpose of them regarding me to be eligible for MBChB.  They said that it would, and that since the MPhil was ungraded my GPA would come from my previous years of full-time study.  It turns out, however, that NZ Universities do not have authority to set 'eligibility' criterion for domestic adults.  Domestic adults are declared eligible by parliamentary statute.  The Universities of New Zealand don't seem willing and or able to accept this, however. 
                                </p>

                                <p>It was on the basis of the information that was provided to me by the University of Auckland that I applied to be enrolled in 
                                 PHIL800-18C Philosophy MPhil Thesis 120 points dates 05-03-2018 - 03-03-2019 and my application was recieved by the application deadline.  To the best of my knowledge I was the only person to have applied to that programme and the programme (and graduate level research generally and in the philosophy programme particularly) was not over-subscribed.  The University administration refused to enrol me in the progaramme that I applied to.  They said they were entitled to take however much processing time they wanted and by the time they were done processing it was 'too late' for me to be enrolled in the programme I applied to.  Rather, they enrolled me in various other programmes of study that I had never applied to be enrolled in where those other programmes of study involved different enrolment dates and different amounts of points.  They seemed to think I was stupid for not having applied to study a PhD with them.  I explained I wanted to complete the 120 point qualification in the 'minimum normal or standard time' (1 academic year) and they insisted that it could not be done (as a matter of principle).  They invoiced various programmes of study I had never applied to be enrolled in to my studnet loan without my permission and kept transcripts on those programmes that I had never applied to be enrolled in.  They forced me to labor for those programmes by withholding my qualification completion.  They are psychologically abusive to their studnets.
                                </p>

                                <p>I supplied to the court evidence that I started working under supervision from 05-03-2018.  I had emails from my supervisor taking to me about what reading to be doing and about how to go about searching databases.  My supervisor encouraged me to get into the habit of sending them work, regularly, and acknowledged receipt of work received.  My 6 monthly review progress was overall 'satisfactory' and I submitted a thesis for up to 3 months of external examination on 14 September 2018.  The University refused to get that thesis out to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit  them signing off on my qualification completion.  They said they would fail me unless I kept working and submitted a thesis at a later date.  I submitted another thesis 05 October 2018 and they sent out the under 50,000 word 120 point masters thesis with instructions for the examiners to write 'doctoral reports' of it.  This was an attempt to force externals to say that insofar as it was acceptable (as a doctoral thesis) would require changes to the substance requiring at least 6 additional months re-enrolment.  Which is, effectively a demand that I repeat the year.  When I protested that this practice was corrupt the University re-enrolled me in programmes I never applied to (all this invoiced to my student loan without my permission), my supervisor instructed me to change the thesis in ways she required rather than the examiners, my thesis went back out to externals.  The NZ examiner said they accepted the university failed me.  The overseas examiner requested an oral defence (I can only suppose they wanted to see why the university was failing me).  The regulations said when the outcomes were divergent a third examiner would be appointed.  The Dean said that the examiners agreed that I had failed.  They updated my student records transcript to say that after working on the MPhil under conditions of 'extra time' they failed me for the entirety of the qualification.  That was the fate of my thesis on 'disability and equity in medicine and public health.'  It was not allowed to be completed in a timely fashion.  The University administration refused to allow it to be.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I was assured that they were not treating me any differently from how they treat any other candidate.  The High Court judge asserted they were entitled to refuse to get my thesis out for external examination on the grounds that I submitted it 'too early'.  He said it was an 'administrative mistake' that they demanded 'doctoral reports' rather than masters reports but he didn't have the cognitive capacity to see that asking the examiners to examine the thesis for the wrong qualification would have an impact on the content of their report (e.g., substantive changes would be required to turn a masters thesis into a doctoral thesis since a masters thesis was required to be under 50,000 words whereas a doctoral thesis is closer to 100,000 words).
                                </p>

                                </p>

                                <p>With respect to Roe v University of Waikato the High Court Judge asserts that they were entitled to refuse to get my thesis out for external examination on the grounds that I submitted it 'too early'.    The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications.  They define a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  
                            <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a> 
                            </p>

                            <p>The University of Waikato offers a 120 point MPhil qualification.  That means it has been approved by the TEC as being 'right sized'.  The academic quality and integrity people, the NZVCC approved the qualification.  It is listed in the University Calendar.  I applied to be enrolled in it.  The University refuses to allow anybody to complete that qualification, however.  They believe they are entitled to require studnets to work for at least 12 months on their thesis before undergoing an external examination period of up to 3 months.  Since you are required to be enrolled at the end of the external examination period that means that if the examination period takes 3 months then you are required to be enrolled in and pay fees for an enrolment period of 12 months plus 3 months for a total of 15 months.  But it doesn't stop there.  They believe that if the external examiners say anything about changes needing to be made to the substance (e.g., a referene to be added, a section to be moved around) then they are entitled to require the studnet to re-enrol for an additional 6 months and also undergo another external examination period of up to 3 months.  That means another 9 months added.  Basically forcing the student to repeat the f*cking year.  They say that the outcome of what they like to call 'first examination' is always that the student is required to pay fees for another 9 months.  This is fairly inevitable.  That is to say, they offer the 120 point qualification with the expectation that students will end up working for at least 12 months plus 3 months plus 6 months plus 3 months for a total of 24 months (2 years).  What happens then depends a  bit on the university.  Waikato has this 'option' for the university administration whereby the studnet takes another 2 1/2 months to make minor changes.  Find another reference.  Move a comma.  Etc.  The University administration believe they have discretion to force this -- else they can say the studnet failed to meet their requirements and the qualification is withheld.  I think it is important for international community to know that this is going on in NZ Universities.  The High Court was informed and they refused to put things right in a timely fashion.  They believe that this behavior is appropriate academic quality and integrity for NZ Universities.  This is partiuclarly important information for international studnets who may find their visas expiring (anad them required to leave the country without their degree).  I'm sorry.  New Zealand Universities seem to have decided that they are entitled to run this scam.  This is the scam they are running.  I have posted the evidence as to how they treated me.  You can see in teh courts judgments that the courts believe they are not treating me any differently from how they treat other studnets.  The courts also state that they do not think that this matter that I bring before the courts is a matter of public interest and they also think that the matter that I bring before the courts is one that I cannot win.  There are no merits to my case.  I also post about how I paid the fees associated with filing in the tenancy tribunal on a different matter.  The outcome was declared 'suppressed' by the courts.  That is to say, I paid the fees the court set without questioning or applying for consideration of exemption and even after receiving the filing fee money the courts refused to find in the interests of justice.  There does not appear to be precedent that paying the fees they demand will actually result in them processing or progressing things properly.  It is just more money for them, is all.
                            </p>

                            <p>Here is how much the Inland Revenue now says I owe the New Zealand Government for my 'Education' and 'Training' that are not acknowledged because New Zealand qualifications apparently expire 5 years post-graduation (well, not the Judges law degrees, apparently, but my qualifications have expired): 
  
                            <a href="judicial-review/ird-shot.pdf" target="_self"> $104,663.</a>

                            They have not provided a break-down of what courses they recorded me as having been enrolled in, in what year.  I have transcripts for some years that I will upload.  They acknowledge that I have completed BA(hons) and an MA (I can't tell whether they invoiced 1 year or 2 years or more of fees total for the MA - it looks to me from my transcript that they may have double-billed).  They refuse to acknowledge that I have completed anything since then.  They keep invoicing my student loan -- for courses that I never applied to be enrolled in (changing enrolment dates for more billings for them which make me look like I'm slow).  They take my research work, particularly, and give it to third parties without crediting me (or paying me).   
                            </p>

                            <p>The Education and Training Act 2020 (and previous iterations of the Act) all state that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible to be enrolled in whatever programme they apply to.  The Act states that when a programme is over-subscribed (more applicants than available places) then the University may use a selection criterion.  The University of Auckland published a selection criterion involving GPA, UMAT / UCAT, interview score.  They informed me that they were happy to use the grades from my previously completed qualifications -- so long as I completed a further qualification for the purposes of 'eligibility'.  They said that I was required to complete the MPhil for 'eligibility'.  But this is false.  As a domestic adult I was eligible all along.  THey were therefore required to apply tehir selection criterion to my application regardless of whether or not I had completed a qualification in the last 5 years.  They don't get to decide who is and who is not eligible.  The source of eligibility is the statute and not their discretion.  The University and the courts simply refuse to hear this.  They refuse to summarise this way of putting things or seeing things or stating things in their judgments.  THey refuse to accept my obviously correct characterisation of the issue. 
                            </p>

                            <p>Otago, too, thinks they get to decide what students they will enroll in what programme for whatever arbitrary (including discrimatory) reasons they want.  They don't believe that international standards apply to them or to their conduct.  Look at the choices they make (e.g., Dr Leeks).  The untrainable qualities that they value.
                            </p>

                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  They aren't progressing the filings. They are refusing to supply applications, refusing to process applications on their academic merits.  Apparently it isn't a matter of public interest how they pick and choose people to pass themsleves off as 'doctors' in our hospitals.
                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  Demanding me to pay more and more and more money to the courts else they force all my cases aborted, or abandoned.  <a href="judicial-review/sc-eyes.pdf" target="_self"> Here is the Judgement of the Supreme Court that I am attempting to appeal on the grounds that it is manifestly grotesquely unjust. </a>  It is like they have their eyes poked out.  Our highest court does not seem to have the conception of justice, at all.  It was the courts decision to delay Roe v University of Waikato proceedings until AFTER Roe v NZVCC and also until AFTER Roe v University of Auckland.  The Judge for Roe v NZVCC made all kinds of pronouncement in his judgment on the matter of Roe v University of Waikato.  That is to say instead of judging the issue he was supposed to be judging (the inaction of Chris Whelan in his capacity as CE of the NZVCC) he thought he would weigh in on whether or not I had done enough for completion of the MPhil Degree.  Clearly that is a matter of the Judge of a different case to decide!  The reasoning seems to be 'we don't choose you, Ms Roe.  If that means we declare you non-person criminal then that is what we do to justify the fact that we don't choose you'.  This country is not even pretending to be rule by law.  It runs on 'exceptions' or 'exemptions' only (that need to be begged, bribed, else stolen) so far as I can see.  The Supreme Court refused to appoint an aimicus to ensure there was no miscarriage of justice.  Refused to appoint a legal aid lawyer to help me with my filings (when I contacted everyone listed for civil on the the civil Legal Aid list and nobody would file the paperwork to help me with any of the cases).  Apparently our Legal Aid system is working.  Who is it working for?  It is working for who?  We do not appear to have a functioning judiciary (tertiary education system, health system).  Where does all the money go?  Apparently they would rather pay 'recruitment officers' and 'marketers' to make it look like we are wanting to hire other things and just continually re-advertise and re-market positions with no actual intention of filling them with paid workers, at all.  This is not a developed nation.  It is too corrupt.
                            </p> 

                            <p>
                            It seems to me that the Australian Constition explicitly states that New Zealand is regarded, by them, to be a State of the Federation of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  Australia refuses to honor it's own Constitution.  New Zealand seems to function as a detention camp of Australia only.  That is how the NZ Government chooses to keep the people of New Zealand.

                            <p>Una Jagose doesn't seem to have the job of instructing Crown Law to prosecute corruption within New Zealand Universities, or within the Judiciary (where judges refuse to accept evidence and where the supreme court punishes people for bringing injustices before the courts).  It seems there is no evidence that they will accept that would attest to corruption.  None of the invoicing information that I provided (e.g., 0.5 EFTS = 120 points = 60 points = indefinate enrolment).  They appear to have complete freedom to do anything they want with impunity.  Our Universities are nothing other than slave or detention camps designed to waste time only by delaying people until they die.  This is not the developed world.  <p> <a href="judicial-review/crown-law.pdf" target="_self"> Blow off response. </a>

Here's how it goes.  I file against the ADHB.  They order a case management conference.  They say I need to revise and resubmit my filings.  I say I can't do that without them handing over my case file notes because this is the evidence that there is.  I don't know what dates I was detained until I see what they say in my notes.  I don't know if I was unlawfully drugged until I see my notes.  They say I can't go on a fishing expedition.  I say they are required to give me my file notes.  They don't like that I said 'in the name of the OIA (rather than privacy act)'  SO revise and re-submit Ms Roe.  No,  you can't have a lawyer.  No,  you can't have an amicus.  Re-file your filings Ms Roe.  Else,-- what?  I'm in contempt of court for refusing to file and re-file and re-file and re-file and slave slave slave for the courts?  I'm to 'stay' indefinately?

                             </p>

                             <p>If you argue with a fool long enough you wonder who the fool really is.  The trouble is that I didn't ask to be a citizen of here.  I don't think that a reasonable and solvent person would choose to be.  I mean, what do you say in response to the courts thinking that it is not a matter of public interest how NZ Universities choose to violate statute with respect to enrolling, progressing, completing, and progressing complaints of students.  The statute says they are supposed to enrol students in courses of the students choosing (the Univerity administration does not get to stream students into degrees they want the students to do) and yet this is what they are doing.  The statute says they are supposed to uphold the academic freedoms of students to work to internationally accepted standards of scholarship.  But they refuse to get students work out to international community so as to prevent and prohibit international community from signing the students off.  They did not get my work to externals not because they were afraid that I would be failed by international community -- but because they believed I would be passed.  They think their job is to prevent and prohibit and obstruct and confuse and delay...  They aren't functioning as universities at all, they are functioning as slave labor detention camps.  That is a matter of public interest.  They go about blackbirding for students trying to get people to pay into a system internationally (as well as domestically) that is designed to extract forced labour out of them (and additional payments from forced re-enrolments etc) and they don't do any of the things they are supposed to do when it comes to at the very very very very least getting out of the f*cking way between the student and the external examiners.  They think that they can grant or withhold degrees for whatever arbitrary reasons they want.  The 'yay' or 'boo' theory of academic merits where the council picks out the students who...  I don't know.  I don't know what reason you have to think that if you paid the bribes or the exit payments that would inspire them to do what they say they will do if you pay them off without complaint.  Then the courts say 'pay the courts pay the courts pay teh courts pay the courts pay the courts' and they won't accept your filings.  They insist on recharacterising the issue into one they pronounce failed.  That is to say the courts choose to behave no better than the universities.  This is not a developed nation.  It does not have a functioning administration.

                            <p>How long can it possibly take to get credit for 1 year of work?  That I completed in 2018?  The University Calendar Regulations provide a list of outcomes of examination (a) - (f).  The ONLY outcome of examination that did not outright contradict the reports of 2 external examiners (and the fact they refused to return the thesis to the candidate) was that I had up to 10 weeks to supply a substantively updated thesis in fulfilment of requirements for the Degree.  Since they refused to post the thesis back to the candidate (when their examiners pack said that courier return of the thesis costs would be met by the Univesrity upon request) that meant they were not requiring me to keep working for 6 additional months under conditions of re-enrolment.  I supplied a substantively updated thesis on 05 February 2019 and again on 24 February 2019 that had been changed, I believed in ways required by the examiners.  The University was required to get that thesis to the externals and ALLOW them to sign off on completion of the degree.  The University refused to do that.  Again, hoarding the thesis.  3 lots of thesis submissions just hoarded by the university administration.  I did everything I was required to do in completion of requirements for the degree and the University refused to do any of the things they were supposed to do.  They didn't enrol me properly.  They didn't get my work to externals on at least 3 separate occasions.  Just refused to do it.  They bullied me continually saying I couldn't do the qualification, they wouldn't allow it.  I said that just because I was doing a thesis *about* disability did not mean I was intellectually handicapped.  I was not asking for accommodations or extra time.  They assured me they were not treating me any differently from any other candidate.  This is how they treat their candidates.  It is not a university.  They refuse to do any of the things that are required to allow timely completion of student research.  THey aren't trying to train a workforce of medical doctors (or anything at all) they are only interested in keeping slaves.

                            <p>I thought Waikato wanted a graduate entry medical program.  I thought they would want me to do well and be connected to the Waikato.  Help them develop their program.  But the idea of the program was a front (maybe to put in a bid so more money went to Auckland and Otago than would have without a bid from Waikato).  But the idea would have been that the Waikato people wanted to collect more and more and more money from students for enrolling in Med and then it would simply put them to work acting as doctors (hey, they watch shortland street don't they?) in the Waikato hospital and various other places around the Waikato.  Instead of the students paying Auckland University to bonded-servitue in the hospitals during their studnet years (to only ever  be replaced by new 'students' and failed out of the qualification), they wanted them to be paying Waikato University.  That is to say, they weren't actually interested in having me be part of the development of medicine and medical training in the Waikato at all.  Comes back again to not actually wanting the people to live.  Not actually wanting the people to have healthcare.  Not paying qualified people to work in the health system.  Not signing off on qualification completions.  Not processing enrolments, even.  Just won't do it.  Taking all of the money and not doing any of the things that they are supposed to do.  Wanting to collect up more and more and more money for the administration, is all.  Wanting the administration to have more and more power over more and more bonded servants or slaves.  There's nothing there.  It's so very very very very sad.
