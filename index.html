                            <p>Full time GPA of 8.6.  But that's meaningless  because they don't grade things properly.  They will actually record that studnets have failed (F).   Not because they didn't go to class.  Not because they didn't prepare for class.  Not because they didn't do the readings.  Not because they didn't listen attentively.  Not becauase they didn't learn the content.  Not because they didn't demonstrate understanding of the content.  Not because they didn't engage in or with the content.  But because none of those things are valued.  We don't care about any of that.  In fact, identify the people who engage with education and fail those ones.  Then give the highest grades to the ones who didn't go to class.  And or who didn't to the readings.  And or the ones who yakkity yak yakked their way through the lecture.  And or the ones who didn't hand in their essays on time.  And or the ones who handed in someone elses and passed it off as their own.  And or the ones who paid the administration to record a higher grade.  And or the ones who bullied however many other studnets into leaving altogether because it's been taken over by psychopaths.  </p>

                            <p>For how many years are you supposed to pay the university pay the university pay the university pay the university -- before they are supposed to pay you?  If you are still at the university after that time then they pay you they pay you they pay you they pay you.  They pay you they pay you.  They pay you.  They pay.</p>

                            <p>There isn't anything there, you see.  It's garbage.  A f*cking hoax of a f*cking scam.  They won't pay people to research and teach.  They pay people to keep hostages endentured servants slaves.  They won't get the work out to external examiners and allow the students to complete the qualifications in a timely basis.  They won't pay the workers.  Theres nothing actually there.</p>

                            <p>What education and training system?</p>

                            <p>What judiciary?  I guess that's because there aren't any law graduates.  What health system?  No doctors or nurses.  Theres nothing there.  Garbage dump of a wasteland.  Not even trying to be fair at all.</p>

                            <p>What's that?  The Government is just a script-bot.  Designed to keep Australasia socially engineered as a prison camp detention camp slave camp.  That's how the administration governs still.  Either they choose to or it's just the output of script-bots.  Can't lay a complaint with the human rights people, for example.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  'There could be no application received that would attest to...'  Just put that down as the automated response to every complaint you receive.  'There could be no evidence recieved or accepted such that' for lowest perceived corruption ever.  Just script bot that every time.  Or only pay people to output indistginushable from a computer programme.  Script bot responses.  For the script bot 'judges' who can't see anything wrong.  No evidence could be submitted such that...  Theres  nobody home.  Nothing there at all.</p>
