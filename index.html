                            <p> https://www.nzherald.co.nz/kahu/the-investment-into-maori-apprentices-has-turned-around-maori-unemployment-youre-hired/4NEY2WL5RNAQ5KJ2OSEYM7IZGE/  Do the apprentices get paid minimun wage for every week of their apprenticeship?  Or do the 'apprentices' have levels of debt recorded against their name, with the Inland Revenue Department?  The Government is paying the training provider to keep them as hostages.  Prisoners.  Detainees.  Slaves.  They aren't paid minimum wage for the work that they do -- are they?  Are they paid minimum wage?  How many decades are they supposed to do their 'apprenticeship'  before they are graduated from their qualifications so that they can go into their minimum wage paying jobs?  What education and training system?  You don't pay the workers.  You pay the slavers to keep slaves.  How are they unemployed when they don't make minimum wage for the work that they do?  What workforce? What economy?  </p>

                            <p>Helen Nicolson announced that she understood the concerns of her staff and that she and anybody earning over $100,000 per annum would be exercising pay restraint and that the retirement age would be enforced.  SOme people had had government payroll for 40+ years.  If they still couldn't function in the private sector no more government payroll for them.  Time to retire.  Stand down ffs.  No.  She didn't.  She says she doesn't get enough for each hostage for her to pass on to each hostage so much as a minimum wage.  What education and training programme?    What University?  How many graduate research students are acknowledged as having completed 120 points of study in 1 year?  How many 360 point graduate research students are acknowledged as having completed 360 points of study in 3 years?  What law grads? What medicine grads?  What engineering grads? What skilled workers?  What University?  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camp. It's sooooo competitive. Only over Helen's dead  body. </p>

                            <p>Australia and New Zealand have never met obligations to refugees.  NZ and Australia are goverened, still, as prison, slave, detention camps.  It doesn't make any sense to the people who have been appointed leaders that people come here for refuge.  People are supposed to flee from this region for refuge.  Nobody comes to these lands to seek refuge.  They come fleeing the laws of overseas.   All the PGY3 people should apply to be medical doctors in Australasia.  ALl the ones who weren't matched to train and work in the UK or US or Canada.  ALl the ones they didn't want.  We would  love to take all the ones they didn't want and bully and abuse them.  Put them to 'work' for no pay.  Tell them how garbage garbage garbage and crap they are.  We will have things no other way.  Locals need not apply.  Justice Toogood says that they can just enrol and not enrol and graduate and not graduate and just do anything they want.  Right Ashley?  If you put the kids on ventilators and breathe for them they will breate exactly how you think they should.  That would be a good job for you -- right?  I'm sure you know better than they how their mental health should be managed.   </p>

                            <p>Punative only.</p>

                            <p>It takes a lot of work to get the buy-in where Professor Glue's Glue Factory is the only game in town.  They should get the law guy who they only graduated from law because he likes to stick pins and pencils in infants...  THey should give him the job defending the Law Society's decision to preferentially register him and other people similarly willing to work the job for low to no pay.  They could pay him more than 100,000 per year to say that they didn't receive any applications to Law, to graduate from Law, to be registered with the law society..  No applications were acknowledged as received..  Except applications from him and people like him.. Who are given second chances only because they think they will go on to persecute on behalf of the government.  Government prosecution.  Guffaw.  Government persecution.  Join the Government persecutors.  Get paid more and more and more (your earning potential is unlimited limitless) depending on your capaciaty to persecute.  Chris will give you $400 a fortnight, was it Chris?  For keeping another as 'apprentice-slave'. ALl you need is to just keep sending information to the IRD that this, that, and the other has been re re re re re re re enrolled in your apprentice training programme.  Justice Toogood can't see anything wrong with that. </p>

                            <p>Which of the following is not one of the 4 main tissue types?  Nervous tissue. Adipose tissue.  Epithelial tissue.  Cardiac tissue.  Skeletal tissue.  These are the kinds or sorts of multiple choice questions that you get..  They then publish lists of supposed or apparent idenficiation numbers and grades.  So there are identification numbers associated with scores in the high 90's for these kinds of tests where there really are rather a lot of these kinds of questions.  How is it possible for some studnets to do so well on these kinds of questions?  I mean...  Epithelial.  Adipose.  Nervous.  The fourth kind is 'muscle'.  There is skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle and enteric muscle...  But cardiac tissue and skeletal tissue are both as bad of an answer as each other.  How can you decide between them?  SO..  If you know enough to narrow it down to 2 possible answers then you have a 50:50 on whether you get that answer correct or not..  How are people scoring in the high 90's on these kinds or sorts of tests when instructors write their own multi-guess and these are the kinds of questions they are asking?  It doesn't seem plausible that anybody does well...  Or, if you do, you are a statistical anomoly.  ANd that isn't likely to be repeated in the next test.  The next course.  And so on.  </p>

                            <p>It used to be that they weren't allowed to make it impossible for students to complete their degree qualifications by (for example) simply not offering a course and saying that passing the course was compulsory.  But they are still trying to have impossible degrees where it is not possible for anyody to actually get teh qualification.  What education and training system?  F*cking scummy scam.  There isn't anything there.</p>

                            <p>Who wouldn't want a big and important job in education?  I'm sure various people get erections just thinking on it.  That is what they seem to want to recruit.  NZSEX lolz.  New Zealand Stock EXchange.  lolz.  Tertiary Education Commission is about billions in claiming children as low as the age of 7, they reckon.  The Education and Training Act says domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 are eligible to be enrolled but there is more and more and more and more money to be made off the traffickign of children.  What education and training system?  Not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                            <p>Where is Nieve?  She's 6 now, right?  She enrolled in a school, somewhere?</p>

                            <p>The most underproductive economy in the world, was it?  People write books via text message on cellphones from prison camp and nothing has changed since Janet Frame was thrown in a psych facility (more and more and more and more money for them) because they never were going to pay her to keep her own detainees.  MOre and more and more and more money for keeping your hostages re re re r ere re re re enrolled.  There isn't anything here.</p>
