                             <p>Pretty funny haha that the Massey Academics want to say that if they lose their jobs their graduate students will suffer.  Why would their graduate students suffer?  The graduate students are supposed to be working independently.  Tell you what, if the people payrolled to supervise aren't being helpful, aren't getting the students work out to external examiners in a timely fashion etc etc...  Then maybe it really is time for the people on payroll to supervise...  To be let go.  They don't seem willing or able to do the job for which they are paid.  If they aren't going to be helpful then get out the f*cking way.  Hey.  </p>

                             <p>The thing about them treating international students as cash cows...  It's not just about international students.  It's about domestic students, too.  The farming of people.  That was Stuart McCutcheon's ideology.  Wasn't it?  That was why he was appointed to position as head of NZ's supposedly premier University.  Because he had attributed to him a doctoral thesis about how the farmers cry cry cry cry cry for more and more and more government handouts every winter they won't feed the lambs they'll die in the winter cold every year without more and more and more money.  The unbridled greed.  The business model.  Very...  Silence of the Lambs.  Wouldn't you say?  Where is the research output?  Where is all the independent graduate student research?  The 1 year theses?  The 2 year doctoral theses...  When are the public oral examinations scheduled?  So that interested members of the public can go along and see the oral examination of the doctoral candidates?  What university ffs?  There's nothing there.  What a f*cking face of a joke of a f*cking hoax of a f*cking scummy scam.  What 'University'?  There's nothing there.</p>

                             <p>We are seriously supposed to think that the anti-intellectual governments of NZL...  The...  Relatively most un-educated government in the western world...  Our un-intellectual government...  We are supposed to think that Jacinda Arden is a shining model of intellectualism, now?  Because she got given an honorary degree for reading teleprompts?  She gets 3 fellowships from Harvard for a book she's going to write (and not a book she's already written) when she never even applied for fellowships from Harvard and she never did a 4th year at University...  It just defies credibility, hey.  What a f*cking farce of a joke of a hoax of a f*cking scummy scam.</p>

                             <p>Basically...  People won't share.  Only over our dead bodies.  Well, then.  The choices that they've made.  Something about doing unto others as you'd have them do unto you.  Well then.  You see how they've chosen for themselves to be treated.  Let them gnaw each others arms off.    F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                             <p>I have a great idea for maximising the amount of unhappiness in the world.  Want to hear it?  Of course you do.  What could be a more admirable goal?  It goes like this...  You tell everybody that there is one and only one goal or point or purpose or aim in life.  Everybody is just fighting over one thing.  The same thing.  Everybody wants the same thing.  But not everybody can have the thing.  In fact nobody can have it.  There isn't anything there in fact.  It was just an elaborate ideology created to maximise the amount of suffering and pain and sickness and disease...  Just busy trying to be God.  All of the power and none of the responsibility.  Wasn't me.  Contracted out to the singularity.  The computer programme was the only thing that gave me the outputs or answers that I would accept.  I went with the one that gave me only the outputs or answers I would accept.  That was clearly the best one.  But when it comes time for responsibility for the one I picked, well, then, wasn't me.  Must have  been the singularity that did it.
                            </p>

                            <p>How much money did the NZ governmetn spend over how many years on...  Shortland Street?  Seriously..  How much money went into creating a television show to be exported around the world..  A marketing campaign.  An educational promotion...  To accompany 'wah wah wah we don't have any doctors.  Aw..  Pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for a visa to come to NZ because we don't have any doctors'.  How much money did NZ choose to invest in Shortland Street?  I suppose they would have done it because they didn't have a better idea of how to make money.  THey thought they would make money off of foreigners paying and paying and paying to come here and become doctors or nurses or whatever...  I suppose.  We thought that it would be a good use of arts funding.  To create a medical show about a...  About the Aucklaknd City Hospital?  About Middlemore?  About a private hospital?  Was it?  About who wants to be a doctor and the role they have and the power and so on...  Who wants to be a healthcare administrator...  About playing doctors and nurses...  And so on...  A creative output of NZL.</p>

                            <p>Was it?  It wasn't really...  Was it.  It was...  Purchased.  Wasn't it.  By some production company or whatever.  The idea of it.  Of NZL having that as a creative output.  It being about a private no public hospital and what it would do to lure people to the state of NZL.  It was an Australian...  Was it..  Grundy production?  OR similar.  They didn't want to do 'Home and Away' (about how everybody wants to be in state care in Australia uplifted from unhappy unhealty homes and raised in a trailor park)...  They specifically wanted to do a show about a hospital in NZL.</p>

                            <p>Why?  Well..  Dr Leeks don't grow on trees...  It takes a community to raise a child like that.  To grow up to do all the things he's revered for.  Everything it was that was valued.  He was worth moving to Melbourne and I don't know how much he was payrolled so that he could continue on with his crimes against the people of Melbourne.  It wasn't that they didn't know.  They picked him out because they did know.  They valued him as they knew him to be.  How...  Motivating.  And...  Inspiring.  Apparently.  Or similar.  Pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for a visa to move to NZL, everybody.  If you feel suitably motivated and inspired to become a Doctor.</p>

                            <p>Everybody else..  Well.  Nobody else applied.  Turns out.  Nobody else was able to get an application in!  Everybody else had their application thrown away!  He was the only game in town.  The only one of any value.  All heil Dr Leeks!  They should build a statue to his honor.  Only, they don't need to.  I mean, it's not like what he was doing was any different from what most everyone else on payroll was and is doing.  Right, Sterelny?  What's that you say?  We've been taken over  by over taken by psychoapths.  Yes.  Well, I guess you would know.   You being the only game in town, and all.  The only one they'd payroll.  To take all the philosophy curriculum out of the philosophy department so you can teach?  Do you?  Do you teach?  Or just take all of the research funding...  So you can reattribute authorship and control the narrative.  Oh, please, explain it to me.  How does it go?  The psychopaths have taken over.  We aren't any different from the f*cking apes.  Why shouldn't I just kill you right now?  Oh, because  you are young and cute with wide blinking eyes.  Unless you aren't.  In which case f*ck off and die then.  F*cking psychopaths.  What philosophy programme?  When do your students have their scheduled oral defences?  Did any of your studnets?  Did you have one?  Did you write your thesis or did Frank write it for you?  Is that why you don't want to talk about your supposed earlier works?  Because you never would have been given all the research funding if you actually wrote your own work.  Or something.  If you were actually working independently.  What education and training system?  There's nothing there ffs.  Nobody home.</p>

                            <p>I gave the ANU a document over 100,00 words in length.  I gave the document to my named supervisor, at the time, Kim Sterelny.  I left the acknowledgement section completely blank.  Because I couldn't think of what to say...  What to thank him for.  Thanks for expecting me to go away with various people on various camping trips.  Where you invite the to speak -- but you don't invite me to speak.  Thanks for expecting me to turn up to various other people's talks to show solidarity or whatever because whoever is not with us is against us...  But when I'm talking when did any of you show up for me?  WHen did you show up to my talks at conference?  Once.  I remember.  Relatively early on.  After you launch into a tirade about how I'm not to read from a script because those talks are always awful..  But you know what I have now? I have written f*cking scripts of my talks in the first year particularly (before you told me to stop writing my talks).  Thanks for all your help you f*cking psychopath.  You really helped my work be better.  Not.  I did better work before you arrived - 6 months late to start with the supervision.  The ANU regularly moved people when it was time for students to be signed off as having completed.  They would move the supervisor.  So that people who were employed by the University to supervise would abandon their studnets.  Which, the University and various people on payroll would say..  Meant the studnet needed to begin again.  In otehr words..  The supervisor would flee with their studnets work...  And their studnet would notn get credit for it.  Then the studnet would  be required to begin again under another supervisor.</p>

                            <p>WHen I first started at the ANU Dave Chalmers and Kim Sterelny were both my named supervisors.  The both of them.  YOu can see for yourself that I was working for Dave the first 6 months.  I gave a talk at the consciousness at the beach workshop or conference.  He never gave me written feedback on the talk (even though I provided it to him) and we never had a meeting about my thesis project or whaetver.  He wasn't really supervising me.  But that's okay.  Right?  I mean, doctoral studnets are supposed to be working independnetly. </p>

                            <p>But instead...  Dave sets himself up as head of one end of the table..  And Kim sets himself up as head of the other.  And the studnets are expected to flock to their master, or similar...  To choose.  To choose sides.  Because that's what being independent means.  It means having big wide blinky eyes and begging them not to kill you.  Not playing the choosing game is not an option, apparently.  Like the bit of the Bible where if you are luke warm God will spit you out.</p>

                            <p>But Dave left after I was there for a year or two, anyway.  So he wasn't going to sign me off..  Only there was a student from Otago who started a year later than me who I think Dave did sign off on.  Not sure who wrote his thesis on philosophy of Physics, or whatever.  I thought the studnet had  never studied physics at University...  Anyway...  Whatever.  And of course Martin left and wasn't acknowleldging any of the work I did for him or on his project etc.  And I think about how various others were treated...  Jonathan Shaffer.  How he treated Aisling during her mid-term.  He doesn't offer her any supervision she works indepnednently and gives her mid-term.  And he f*cking tears her a new one.  Senior professor of a field..  Just awful bullying just ripped everything apart.  Nobody else had much to say..  He was just an awful  horrible bully.  And then...  What?  After she works for however much longer on it changing it in ways he requires...  He leaves.  Takes up a position in teh US.  Which means she's been abandoned.  So she needs to start over?  Find a new supervisor to pander to for how many years?  Visa expired.  Time to get out the country...</p>

                            <p>F*cking psychopaths.  </p>

                            <p>ANd that's supposed to be Australia's premier research institution.  Yeah, right.  F*cking scummy scam, I tell you what.  Any research that comes out of there is in spite of and despite them and certainly not  because of them.  It's sooooo hostile and Sterelny (and various others) are selfish selifish selfish pricks.  That's for f*cking sure.  Hurry up and die you f*cking idiots.  There' snothing there.  Well done.  You ruined it, hey.  Well done Australia!  Leading the world in Arts and Science and Tech!  Or maybe nothing nothing nothing at alll.  Prison.  Slave.  Detention camp land.  Paying various people stupid amounts of money to ponce about as rock stars.  To bully and abuse.  What University?  F*cking idiots.  There's nothing there.  What a f*cking joke.</p>

                            <p>The scam works like this.  They tie the visa to the employer.  So, someone immigrates to be a doctor.  They pay and pay and pay for visa processing and so on.  Flights.  Temporary accommodation.  Etc.  Then they get stuffed around and turns out their employer won't pay them.  What employer am I talking about?  The Universties.  The Distict Health Boards.  The Government.  The NZ Governmetn that paid money to advertise and market that we need people from overseas to come here and take up payed employment..  Teaching.  Nursing.  Jobs.  Turns out we won't pay anybody to work those jobs.  We will lure people into paying and paying and paying the NZ governmetn for visa etc and once they've arrived here the employer their visa was tied to will defect on their offer of employment.  They'll  be expected to work as s volunteer or for free or whatever.  They'll be requied to breech or violate the visa conditions.  That's the real thing of it.  To force ciminality upon us all.  Everyone is a crimnal. The only people who would come here must  be criminals fleeing their overseas crimes.  So once they get here we feel entitled to treat them horribly.  But we also treat the locals horribly.  Most fo the time.  Much of the time.  Tell the locals that they can't do various things.  So we can re re re re advertise for more and more money from overseas investment.  </p>

                            <p>So international studnets are lured here.  Their parents are told that NZers don't value education.  The parents don't value it.  So if they come here and value it..  If their kid works just a little bit while the NZ kids are off doing things they value like playing rubgy or diddling each other in the change rooms -- then they can get the well paying jobs.  Teachers and nurses and doctors and lawyers and so on.  Because NZers don't value education.  They've  been told.  That's why the NZ kids aren't allowed to sit their exams.  Why the work isn't being handed over to externals to  be assessed on it's academic merits.  All the energy and effor that goes into the stabotage.  The elaborate f*cking hoax.</p>

                            <p>And they get here and realise, I suppose it dawns on them gradually...  How much they've  been set up.  They never will pay them.  They'll just lure ne migrants here.  Else breed new locals.  F*cking psychopaths.  I swear.  WHERE IS MY MONEY, HEY???  HELLO???  MY ACADEMIC QUALIFICATIONS...  FOR THE ACADEMIC WORK THAT I'VE DONE?  WHERE IS MY ORAL DEFENCE?  WHERE ARE THE 3 COPIES OF MY THEISIS I SUBMITTED 14 SEPTEMBER 2018?  YOU F*CKING STOLE THEM.  WHERE IS MY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY?</p>

                            <p>kim.com pays and pays and pays to not be extradited.  The NZ governmetn takes and takes and takes.  The courts do.  The filing fees etc.  They take his money and they confuse and obstruct and allow things to  be bloated..  Not even trying to have a functioning judiciary.</p>

                            <p>I guess things must be really really really bad in the US that things have to be kept so bad here.  So that people will be lured to move to NYC etc.  Lolz.  Last I heard they were lining up the body bags over there.  Not the very old or the very young.  But the people when it was time for them to pay them.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                            <p>That's why everybody wants to be a doctor or an engineer, I suppose.  So they can better figure how to take out infrastructure.  The keystone so they can take out the bridge or whatever.  Also to target particular individuals.  The thought of *helping* someone is just laughable.  Right?  That's the thing of the Vampire Masquarade lore..  The distance from humanity.  Or, in the lifetime of the individual the older they are the more distant they are from when they were very young.  Dependent.  Someone didn't kill them outright.  Gave them food and stuff so they grew up or straggled up in spite of and despite.  But the older you get the more distant you are from humanity.  SOmeone who helped you.  Why?  Why would anybody help you?  WHen did anybody help you?  Why would they help you?  Eh, Sterelny?  Why would you help anybody?  Why would anybody help you.  It's soooooo competitive!  I see why they pay and they pay and they pay and they pay and they pay and they pay you.  WHy they moved you from Wellington to Canberra for everything it is that they value.  Send Richard Joyce to Wellington for everything it is that they value.  How many of his studnets has he slept with over the years?  I'm wondering...  What that his modus operandi?  Sleep with his doctoral students and then bully them into fleeing.  They can hand over their work for however many years and then feel so disgusting about the whole thing...  That's NZ's main way of people management.  Isn't it?  Isn't that a common theme for NZ?</p>

                            <p>What do you say, Chris Whelan?  All of the complaints that you have from graduate studnets complaining about what it is like studying with NZ Universities..  All fo the complaints that you receive.  Where you say that all of the complaints are personal problems between the studnet and the supervisor and none of them are to be upheld.  Rather, the studnet is required to flee.  Basically.  Right?  SO I guess you probably get lots of compliants from students regarding senior people cooercing them into sexual relationships etc etc only to find that the supervisors will then be all disgusted by the studnets research output.. . That's the theme -- right?  Read Carolyn Mason's second report of my masters thesis.  She would be embarrassed if anybody were to know that she passed it.  That's what she said.  She was embarrassed to be associated with the thesis.  She's embarrassed.  Is anybody else embarrassed that Canterbury University was okay about an employee of their saying such things in an examiners report?  The externals are supposed to be anonymous.  They are.  But they kept my intellectual property.  And the University of Waikato made the information as to who my external examienrs were available to me (maybe accidentally or maybe they were intentionally sh*t stirring) on my student portal.  SO I know who is responsible for the NZ external reports.  She's trying to bully me into feeling shame and walking away from the research output.  The one she kept.  Where is my thesis September 14, 2018 that was shipped to you for hte purposes of external examination only, Caroline Mason?  What did you do with it?  Where is it?  You say you didn't shred it - or you would have remembered.  You kept it.  You f*cking psychopath.  You don't deserve to have studnets.  You shouldn't be allowed around children.  You shouldn't be placed in positions of repsonsibility.  What's that you say?  Take the sperm and take the eggs and raise the infants in incubators.  That's a great idea, Carolyn.  Take sperm and eggs without consent.  Take organs without consent.  Raise infants who are property of..  Of who?  Of you?  The University?  The NZ Govermetn?  And then just take and take and take and take and take.  Just take f*cking everythign for you.  You selfish f*cking b*tch.  It would have f*cking killed you to have requested an oral defence.  WTF.  It was a 120 point masters thesis ONLY that you were sent.  I know the Uni gave you templates to write 'doctoral reports' of it.  Now..  Were you paid to write 'doctoral reports' or were you paid to write 'masters reports'.  What token amount were you paid?  Because the amounts are different.  As is the invoice to the governmetn.  I'm sure.  For the false billings the 'Universities' are doing.</p>

                            <p>Because the truth of it is..  They say they need to enrol international studnets because we don't have any people wah wah wah.  NZers don't want to be enrolled in grad research degrees!  We actually don't have any studnets.  That's how competitive it is.  It's sooooo competititieve that there's nothing there in fact.  Turns out only 1 or 2 people want to do something that only needs 1 or 2 people to do it in fact.  But that's not very gratifying for people who get off on being abusive bullies, now, is it?  It must  be competitive!  The kiddies must be falling over each other to do anyting anything anything.  Unbridled greed.  F*cking psychopaths.  </p>

                            <p>I remember being targeted for a stats NZ survey, however many years ago.  Someone knocks on my door and tells me that I've been selected to fill out a survey.  That I'm required (by law) to let them into my house.  I'm required to listen to them read the questions and tell them  my answers.  And they will write their understanding of the answers to the questions down as my answers on the stats NZ survey form.  I tell them that I really don't think so (I mean most people are working 9-5 and clearly are not participating in these shenanigans when the stats NZ surveyers keep the same hours).  I tell them to leave the forms and I'll fill them out myself and post them to the address I'm required to post them to...  And they won't do it.  They just won't do it.  Nope.  Not going to happen.  That's how much the government was refusing to do the stats NZ surveys properly.  The biased sample they were getting (only from people who happened to be home when the surveyer came.  Only people who were bullied into cooperating).  The surveyers were making up answers.</p>

                            <p>Bullies, Hey.  Then the Covid Nasal Swabs.  Targeting the children of a south auckland school.  Telling people they were required to have nasal swabs stuck very high and very hard up their noses in the  name of public  health.  Yeah, right.  Targeting the children of south auckland.  The immunisations.  The people who couldn't have one when they wanted one (never will be enough to go around) the people who were forced to have one when they didn't want one...  The bullying and abuse.  The constant bullying and abuse.  The asking people what they want / need -- for the purposes of being withholding only.  The blatant bullying and abuse.</p>

                            <p>About 10 people want to do something that only about 10 people can do.  Therefore we will roll out a marketing campaign or whatever to get 1,000,000 people all signed up..  They all want to do it!  They all want to do it!  They don't really... But we are drumming up demand!  Now we can teach them all 'awwwww we don't always get what we want we can't all have what we want'.  It's sooooo competitive.  THe 10 people who wanted to do it in the first place can't do it.  Don't get to.  None of them do.  A group who never wanted to do it does it instead.  Because they have been told what they want and what they want is to ensure that nobody gets to do what they want.  That sounds like the kiwi way, right there.  That's the real problem.  So far as I see it.  We will not f*cking well listen to what people have to say.  FOrcing and inflicting..  For the purposes of bullying and abuse.  F*cking hell...</p>

                            <p>WHERE'S MY MONEY.  Hey.  Time to deploy me into a position of being paid.  All these people on payroll to prevent and prohibit and confuse and obstruct and deny..  It certainly can't be that lack of capacity or knowledge or skills or training is the problem, here, because you'll appoint people into position with none of the above.  Apparently Ashley Bloomfield is professor now?  He never applied to be enrolled in graduate school.  He never wrote a research output.  He has no research output.  He never enrolled in or did the work for PhD or MD.  So they deploy him into positon with the 'University' of Auckland.  Makes sense.  HOw many hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars are they going to pretend to pay him to..  Lure international students here so they can treat them really really really really horribly in their public health degrees.  I suppose that's the idea.  He could be an avatar.  Likely he is.  Likely they don't pay him anymore than they pay Jacinda.  What is the point of Jacinda.  Saying that people should want to go to Harvard so they can be taught by people on payroll (supposedly or apparently) who don't have any research output at all.  That makes sense of why people would want to go to Harvard.  To be taught by such intellectuals.  Yeah, right.  What a f*ckign joke,  hey.</p>

                            <p>WHERE'S MY MONEY!!!  ALl these people over the age of 65 who have had more than 45 years of government payroll.  They have had plenty of time to plan for their retirement.  To save money for their retirement.  So, if they didn't want to retire, they could set up a private start-up or something.  Invest in the private sector.  Instead of being the biggest babies ever taking and taking and taking and taking from the public sector.  Expecting however many people to f*cking well curl up and die becuase they don't feel like giving up their payroll.  Get the f*ck out.  Stupid selfish idiots.  Ruining everything for us all.  The only thing you can say, really, is that at least they get the health system they made.  The aged care institutions they chose to invest in.  The dementia care facilities for theier obvious handicap.  Lack of empathy.  Lack of fairness.  F*cking psychopaths.  Not even trying to be fair at all,  hey.  F*cking hurry up and die, already.  It isn't like I'm saying to them anything they haven't overtly made f*cking well clear they plan for me.  F*ckign psychopaths.  Get out already.  </p>

                            <p>I suppose the best sense of it, really, would be that the new Epstein (or maybe even the old one) needs a new wing-woman.  Someone they can roll out and do big eyes 'awwww' so people feel okay about handing their children over to Harvard for Harvard to do a little anything anything anything...  How much do you think some rich alumni would pay to have Jacinda come stay with them in their summer  house at the Hamptons, or wherever.  Entertain people at private parties.  How much money do you think they could get from her (with or without her daughter) were they to do a fund-raise?  I wonder who her daughters parents are, actually.  Was she a genetic experiment from Harvard?  Incubated in Jacinda.  I suppose that would make pretty good sense of why they picked her to tell the grads of Harvard that nobody had been prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus (for trying to breed knock out babies) in NZ.  That it had been taken out of thte crimes act (even when nobody  had been prosectued for that when it was in the crimes act).  Maybe they should pay and pay and pay and pay and pay to come to NZL where they can do anything anything anything because we don't have any doctors.  Or judges.  apparently.  Need to pull them out of retirement.  No extraditions from NZL to stand trial.  Not part of the developed world at all, it seems.  Are things really that bad in the US that they need to market this when it comes to US influence?  Seems so.</p>

                            <p>It is an interesting thing...  How reading and writing is obviously and clearly involved in the production of research output.   How many hours per day, do you think, would be devoted to, or required in order to produce what kind of research output, to what kind of quality?  Does Jacinda Ardern strike anybody, anybody at all, as an intellectual?  Studious.  Spending her time reading and writing and thinking and working out.  Rather than spending her time yakkity yak yak yakking wheeling and dealing wining and dining.  There aren't enough hours in the day.  Wouldn't you say?  Oh, but some people are supermen amongst men.  They can be academic intellectuals at the very same time as being high performing politicians at the very same time as being dotting mothers and wives..  All the money for them, therefore.  Nobody else need apply.  Yeah, right.</p>
