                             <p>Pretty funny haha that the Massey Academics want to say that if they lose their jobs their graduate students will suffer.  Why would their graduate students suffer?  The graduate students are supposed to be working independently.  Tell you what, if the people payrolled to supervise aren't being helpful, aren't getting the students work out to external examiners in a timely fashion etc etc...  Then maybe it really is time for the people on payroll to supervise...  To be let go.  They don't seem willing or able to do the job for which they are paid.  If they aren't going to be helpful then get out the f*cking way.  Hey.  </p>

                             <p>The thing about them treating international students as cash cows...  It's not just about international students.  It's about domestic students, too.  The farming of people.  That was Stuart McCutcheon's ideology.  Wasn't it?  That was why he was appointed to position as head of NZ's supposedly premier University.  Because he had attributed to him a doctoral thesis about how the farmers cry cry cry cry cry for more and more and more government handouts every winter they won't feed the lambs they'll die in the winter cold every year without more and more and more money.  The unbridled greed.  The business model.  Very...  Silence of the Lambs.  Wouldn't you say?  Where is the research output?  Where is all the independent graduate student research?  The 1 year theses?  The 2 year doctoral theses...  When are the public oral examinations scheduled?  So that interested members of the public can go along and see the oral examination of the doctoral candidates?  What university ffs?  There's nothing there.  What a f*cking face of a joke of a f*cking hoax of a f*cking scummy scam.  What 'University'?  There's nothing there.</p>

                             <p>We are seriously supposed to think that the anti-intellectual governments of NZL...  The...  Relatively most un-educated government in the western world...  Our un-intellectual government...  We are supposed to think that Jacinda Arden is a shining model of intellectualism, now?  Because she got given an honorary degree for reading teleprompts?  She gets 3 fellowships from Harvard for a book she's going to write (and not a book she's already written) when she never even applied for fellowships from Harvard and she never did a 4th year at University...  It just defies credibility, hey.  What a f*cking farce of a joke of a hoax of a f*cking scummy scam.</p>

                             <p>Basically...  People won't share.  Only over our dead bodies.  Well, then.  The choices that they've made.  Something about doing unto others as you'd have them do unto you.  Well then.  You see how they've chosen for themselves to be treated.  Let them gnaw each others arms off.    F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                             <p>I have a great idea for maximising the amount of unhappiness in the world.  Want to hear it?  Of course you do.  What could be a more admirable goal?  It goes like this...  You tell everybody that there is one and only one goal or point or purpose or aim in life.  Everybody is just fighting over one thing.  The same thing.  Everybody wants the same thing.  But not everybody can have the thing.  In fact nobody can have it.  There isn't anything there in fact.  It was just an elaborate ideology created to maximise the amount of suffering and pain and sickness and disease...  Just busy trying to be God.  All of the power and none of the responsibility.  Wasn't me.  Contracted out to the singularity.  The computer programme was the only thing that gave me the outputs or answers that I would accept.  I went with the one that gave me only the outputs or answers I would accept.  That was clearly the best one.  But when it comes time for responsibility for the one I picked, well, then, wasn't me.  Must have  been the singularity that did it.
                            </p>

                            <p>How much money did the NZ governmetn spend over how many years on...  Shortland Street?  Seriously..  How much money went into creating a television show to be exported around the world..  A marketing campaign.  An educational promotion...  To accompany 'wah wah wah we don't have any doctors.  Aw..  Pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for a visa to come to NZ because we don't have any doctors'.  How much money did NZ choose to invest in Shortland Street?  I suppose they would have done it because they didn't have a better idea of how to make money.  THey thought they would make money off of foreigners paying and paying and paying to come here and become doctors or nurses or whatever...  I suppose.  We thought that it would be a good use of arts funding.  To create a medical show about a...  About the Aucklaknd City Hospital?  About Middlemore?  About a private hospital?  Was it?  About who wants to be a doctor and the role they have and the power and so on...  Who wants to be a healthcare administrator...  About playing doctors and nurses...  And so on...  A creative output of NZL.</p>

                            <p>Was it?  It wasn't really...  Was it.  It was...  Purchased.  Wasn't it.  By some production company or whatever.  The idea of it.  Of NZL having that as a creative output.  It being about a private no public hospital and what it would do to lure people to the state of NZL.  It was an Australian...  Was it..  Grundy production?  OR similar.  They didn't want to do 'Home and Away' (about how everybody wants to be in state care in Australia uplifted from unhappy unhealty homes and raised in a trailor park)...  They specifically wanted to do a show about a hospital in NZL.</p>

                            <p>Why?  Well..  Dr Leeks don't grow on trees...  It takes a community to raise a child like that.  To grow up to do all the things he's revered for.  Everything it was that was valued.  He was worth moving to Melbourne and I don't know how much he was payrolled so that he could continue on with his crimes against the people of Melbourne.  It wasn't that they didn't know.  They picked him out because they did know.  They valued him as they knew him to be.  How...  Motivating.  And...  Inspiring.  Apparently.  Or similar.  Pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for a visa to move to NZL, everybody.  If you feel suitably motivated and inspired to become a Doctor.</p>

                            <p>Everybody else..  Well.  Nobody else applied.  Turns out.  Nobody else was able to get an application in!  Everybody else had their application thrown away!  He was the only game in town.  The only one of any value.  All heil Dr Leeks!  They should build a statue to his honor.  Only, they don't need to.  I mean, it's not like what he was doing was any different from what most everyone else on payroll was and is doing.  Right, Sterelny?  What's that you say?  We've been taken over  by over taken by psychoapths.  Yes.  Well, I guess you would know.   You being the only game in town, and all.  The only one they'd payroll.  To take all the philosophy curriculum out of the philosophy department so you can teach?  Do you?  Do you teach?  Or just take all of the research funding...  So you can reattribute authorship and control the narrative.  Oh, please, explain it to me.  How does it go?  The psychopaths have taken over.  We aren't any different from the f*cking apes.  Why shouldn't I just kill you right now?  Oh, because  you are young and cute with wide blinking eyes.  Unless you aren't.  In which case f*ck off and die then.  F*cking psychopaths.  What philosophy programme?  When do your students have their scheduled oral defences?  Did any of your studnets?  Did you have one?  Did you write your thesis or did Frank write it for you?  Is that why you don't want to talk about your supposed earlier works?  Because you never would have been given all the research funding if you actually wrote your own work.  Or something.  If you were actually working independently.  What education and training system?  There's nothing there ffs.  Nobody home.</p>

                            <p>I gave the ANU a document over 100,00 words in length.  I gave the document to my named supervisor, at the time, Kim Sterelny.  I left the acknowledgement section completely blank.  Because I couldn't think of what to say...  What to thank him for.  Thanks for expecting me to go away with various people on various camping trips.  Where you invite the to speak -- but you don't invite me to speak.  Thanks for expecting me to turn up to various other people's talks to show solidarity or whatever because whoever is not with us is against us...  But when I'm talking when did any of you show up for me?  WHen did you show up to my talks at conference?  Once.  I remember.  Relatively early on.  After you launch into a tirade about how I'm not to read from a script because those talks are always awful..  But you know what I have now? I have written f*cking scripts of my talks in the first year particularly (before you told me to stop writing my talks).  Thanks for all your help you f*cking psychopath.  You really helped my work be better.  Not.  I did better work before you arrived - 6 months late to start with the supervision.  The ANU regularly moved people when it was time for students to be signed off as having completed.  They would move the supervisor.  So that people who were employed by the University to supervise would abandon their studnets.  Which, the University and various people on payroll would say..  Meant the studnet needed to begin again.  In otehr words..  The supervisor would flee with their studnets work...  And their studnet would notn get credit for it.  Then the studnet would  be required to begin again under another supervisor.</p>

                            <p>WHen I first started at the ANU Dave Chalmers and Kim Sterelny were both my named supervisors.  The both of them.  YOu can see for yourself that I was working for Dave the first 6 months.  I gave a talk at the consciousness at the beach workshop or conference.  He never gave me written feedback on the talk (even though I provided it to him) and we never had a meeting about my thesis project or whaetver.  He wasn't really supervising me.  But that's okay.  Right?  I mean, doctoral studnets are supposed to be working independnetly. </p>

                            <p>But instead...  Dave sets himself up as head of one end of the table..  And Kim sets himself up as head of the other.  And the studnets are expected to flock to their master, or similar...  To choose.  To choose sides.  Because that's what being independent means.  It means having big wide blinky eyes and begging them not to kill you.  Not playing the choosing game is not an option, apparently.  Like the bit of the Bible where if you are luke warm God will spit you out.</p>

                            <p>But Dave left after I was there for a year or two, anyway.  So he wasn't going to sign me off..  Only there was a student from Otago who started a year later than me who I think Dave did sign off on.  Not sure who wrote his thesis on philosophy of Physics, or whatever.  I thought the studnet had  never studied physics at University...  Anyway...  Whatever.  And of course Martin left and wasn't acknowleldging any of the work I did for him or on his project etc.  And I think about how various others were treated...  Jonathan Shaffer.  How he treated Aisling during her mid-term.  He doesn't offer her any supervision she works indepnednently and gives her mid-term.  And he f*cking tears her a new one.  Senior professor of a field..  Just awful bullying just ripped everything apart.  Nobody else had much to say..  He was just an awful  horrible bully.  And then...  What?  After she works for however much longer on it changing it in ways he requires...  He leaves.  Takes up a position in teh US.  Which means she's been abandoned.  So she needs to start over?  Find a new supervisor to pander to for how many years?  Visa expired.  Time to get out the country...</p>

                            <p>F*cking psychopaths.  </p>

                            <p>ANd that's supposed to be Australia's premier research institution.  Yeah, right.  F*cking scummy scam, I tell you what.  Any research that comes out of there is in spite of and despite them and certainly not  because of them.  It's sooooo hostile and Sterelny (and various others) are selfish selifish selfish pricks.  That's for f*cking sure.  Hurry up and die you f*cking idiots.  There' snothing there.  Well done.  You ruined it, hey.  Well done Australia!  Leading the world in Arts and Science and Tech!  Or maybe nothing nothing nothing at alll.  Prison.  Slave.  Detention camp land.  Paying various people stupid amounts of money to ponce about as rock stars.  To bully and abuse.  What University?  F*cking idiots.  There's nothing there.  What a f*cking joke.</p>

                            <p>The scam works like this.  They tie the visa to the employer.  So, someone immigrates to be a doctor.  They pay and pay and pay for visa processing and so on.  Flights.  Temporary accommodation.  Etc.  Then they get stuffed around and turns out their employer won't pay them.  What employer am I talking about?  The Universties.  The Distict Health Boards.  The Government.  The NZ Governmetn that paid money to advertise and market that we need people from overseas to come here and take up payed employment..  Teaching.  Nursing.  Jobs.  Turns out we won't pay anybody to work those jobs.  We will lure people into paying and paying and paying the NZ governmetn for visa etc and once they've arrived here the employer their visa was tied to will defect on their offer of employment.  They'll  be expected to work as s volunteer or for free or whatever.  They'll be requied to breech or violate the visa conditions.  That's the real thing of it.  To force ciminality upon us all.  Everyone is a crimnal. The only people who would come here must  be criminals fleeing their overseas crimes.  So once they get here we feel entitled to treat them horribly.  But we also treat the locals horribly.  Most fo the time.  Much of the time.  Tell the locals that they can't do various things.  So we can re re re re advertise for more and more money from overseas investment.  </p>

                            <p>So international studnets are lured here.  Their parents are told that NZers don't value education.  The parents don't value it.  So if they come here and value it..  If their kid works just a little bit while the NZ kids are off doing things they value like playing rubgy or diddling each other in the change rooms -- then they can get the well paying jobs.  Teachers and nurses and doctors and lawyers and so on.  Because NZers don't value education.  They've  been told.  That's why the NZ kids aren't allowed to sit their exams.  Why the work isn't being handed over to externals to  be assessed on it's academic merits.  All the energy and effor that goes into the stabotage.  The elaborate f*cking hoax.</p>

                            <p>And they get here and realise, I suppose it dawns on them gradually...  How much they've  been set up.  They never will pay them.  They'll just lure ne migrants here.  Else breed new locals.  F*cking psychopaths.  I swear.  WHERE IS MY MONEY, HEY???  HELLO???  MY ACADEMIC QUALIFICATIONS...  FOR THE ACADEMIC WORK THAT I'VE DONE?  WHERE IS MY ORAL DEFENCE?  WHERE ARE THE 3 COPIES OF MY THEISIS I SUBMITTED 14 SEPTEMBER 2018?  YOU F*CKING STOLE THEM.  WHERE IS MY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY?</p>

                            <p>kim.com pays and pays and pays to not be extradited.  The NZ governmetn takes and takes and takes.  The courts do.  The filing fees etc.  They take his money and they confuse and obstruct and allow things to  be bloated..  Not even trying to have a functioning judiciary.</p>

                            <p>I guess things must be really really really bad in the US that things have to be kept so bad here.  So that people will be lured to move to NYC etc.  Lolz.  Last I heard they were lining up the body bags over there.  Not the very old or the very young.  But the people when it was time for them to pay them.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>
