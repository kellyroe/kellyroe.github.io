                        <div class="container">

                            <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/492883/happy-feet-dances-from-dumpster-cardboard-mats-to-world-stage And there is NO STAGE IN NEW ZEALAND.  NO STAGE.  NONE.  The f*cking empty 'high class' commercial spaces up Queen Street that WILL NOT host a art exhibition from (for example) the Elam School of Fine Arts.  NOBODY arriving on a Cruise Ship (the allegedly 'high value tourists' can actually purchase an original piece from an artist in NZ.  Not from Elam School not from a Wananga (a carving, wood, or greenstone) WHAT APPRENTICESHIP SYSTEM???  YOU F*CKING RETARDS>  THERE ISN"T ANYTHING F*CKING LEFT YOU F*CKING IMBIECELS>  THERE ISN'T A F*CKING WAY YOU RETARDED F*CKING MORONS.  NOBODY HERE.  NOTHING HOME>  NO SCIENCE (Awwww we all about the arts and the cultures) NO F*CKING ARTS>  NO F*CKING CULTURES>  RETARDED C*NTS>  THERES  NOTHING HERE) </p>

                            <p>Sigh.  Of course we should point out how f*cking racist it is that they go after Kiri Allen (and Meng Foon) while turning a blind eye to others who have done same to worse.  Also the fact that nobody gave Kiri an informed decision as to what was to the sorts of things that one can expect from uterus removal surgery.  With respect to mental state.  Coming to terms with.  No counselling or whatever to ease her through a transition that she consented to..  Of course.  She wasn't trained in a deprived and then do anything anything anything anything at the first available 'opportunity'.  Of course...  Why does NZ have to be such a f*cking sh*t hole?  Why does it have to be so f*cking nasty and hostile  by design?</p>

                            <p>The office of the ombudsman has delivered some sensible reports.  E.g., the one on psychiatry facilities in the Grafton Hospital.  Some things were not mentioned (e.g., the quality of the non-special food), but the report did contain plenty of high quality critique.  It must be very difficult to provide high quality critique and have that repeatedly ignored.  I do not know why the Office of the Ombudsman did not see any problems with the 'Universities', however.  I suppose they feel that they had bigger fish to fry, so to speak.  But the 'Universities' supply the trained prison guards and micro-mismanagers and con-municators etc.  The psychologists and psychiatrists and so on.  THe front-line staff and the administration over-lords.</p>

                            <p>So, how it works is...  When an over-lord e.g., Dr Leeks or Kiri Allen or whoever does things that most people think are wrong...  THey are having mental health issues that mean we are required to be compassionate about them otherwise we would be bad and horrible human beings.  We are required to forgive them, therefore, and re-instate them giving them second and third and all the chances to continue on re-offending.  But when someone who is not an over-lord is accused of having mental health issues of problems...  That is supposed to explain why they never can be appointed to a position of any real power...  Because they have a mental disease.  Not in the way that we are supposed to feel compassion for them.  But we are supposed to think that they are the real abusers, here.  Oh my!!! Those who were given to Dr Leeks...  The problem is that they were such horrible degenerates they made him do it.  Oh yes they did.  So say the courts!!!  All the consideration for the abusers to enable them to continue on their crimes!!!  All heil Dr Leeks!!! Most motivational and inspirational reason to come to NZ and do anything anything anything that there ever was!!!  Roll up roll up roll up all the pedophiles and psychopaths to the place in the world where you (and only you) will be most valued!!! most valuable!!! Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year for you to be relocated to enable your continued offending...  In f*cking upside down and back to front land.  There isn't anything here ffs.  Taken over by f*cking psychopaths.</p>

                            <p>The problem with the 'Universities' closing courses with low or no enrolments is that they aren't properly processing applications to enrol.  Firstly, they withhold applications to enrol so that domestic adults who are eligible by statute cannot get hold of an application to enrol form.  Secondly, they remove applications to enrol from the applicant pool.  Claiming never to have received them.  Thirdly, they record that students are enrolled or have been enrolled in courses or programmes of study that that student never applied to  be enrolled in.  Many studnets find themselves enrolled in courses not because they would have chosen to be enrolled in those courses, but because the 'University' tells them that they need to do those courses first as pre-requisites or whatever for what they really wanted to do, but the plan all along was to fail them out before they got to do what they wanted.  For example,  how many people want to enrol in an undergraduate degree programme in nutrition?  So they make it a graduate programme with various pre-reqs at undergrad level. So many of the studnets never get to study the programme they wanted (nutrition).  They spend how much money on advertising and marketing and so on to create desire for things that are cheap and easy.  Of course.  Wouldn't the cheapest and easiest thing of all be to enrol everybody in the same programme of study.  Have 1 person read a teleprompt curriculum to the entire population of the 'university'.  Then say they all failed and they have to be re re re re re re re enrolled the following year. Then tell them the 'work experience' placements they are required to go to else they will never never never get their degree completion.  Go work the job.  Oh, and don't forget to pay and pay and pay the 'University'.  The Vice Chancellor needs a payrise.  The problem is that they Vice Chancellor's simply aren't paid enough money.  The trickle down economics isn't working becuase the Vice Chancellor's don't have enough money.  That must be it.  We simply cannot conceive of any other way.</p>

                            <p>It' f*cking well isn't rocket science.  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars go every year for people 65 and over.  People who have already paid off their mortgage on a modest house.  THey are throwing their weight around.  Sexually abusing.  Verbally abusing.  Refusing to do their jobs.  Throwing their weight around.  Won't get out.  We have all these con-municators and 'support' people who get hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars every year to keep student hostages or slaves a slaving.  They don't do any research work themselves.  They get more and more and more and more money for keeping more and more and more studnets re re re re re enrolled.  They won't even pay scholarships to studnets that are suposed to be paid to students.  Corruption.  That is the problem.  Corruption.  What research outputs?  Corruption.  There isn't anything there ffs.</p>

                            <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/132438291/charges-against-former-lake-alice-nurse-91-stopped-due-to-ill-health  How old is Justice Isac?  I think I saw a photograph of him..  From 40 years ago.  How old is he?  When was he supposed to have retired?  How much overpayment has he received since he turned 65?  Will the IRD prosecute him, then?  When was he supposed to have gotten out?  Who should have been appointed Justice instead?  Corruption.  Corruption.  Corruption.  </p>

                            <p>d brand made nz a tourism campaign.  The email was priceless, for those who got it.  Better than the site,  but the site is here:  https://dbrand.com/  They probably won't sue you if you just f*cking take the campain, NZ tourism.  And even if they did who is going to uphold something like that in this jurisdiction?  Answer:  Nobody on payroll.</p>

                            <p>https://www.seek.co.nz/job/68378208?type=standout#sol=de18133b9f758dd29991f73fd23b24f8ecd1f3b0  Well, here we go.  The bail-outs have been announced!  Let the con-munications begin!!!  </p>

                            <p>THe problem is...  The VC demands a payrise!  Otherwise...  Otherwise...  WHy, he'll fail half the graduate students for their re-enrolments and fire everyone in Romance Languages.  WHy not take photos of your hostages and post on kick-start go-fund-me fundraising to pay the con-munications department of the nasty little despot.  Where is the research output of all your 'research academics' ffs?  How about your studnets (along with the enrolment dates associated with their projects)?  It isn't a university when you don't do any f*cking work.</p>

                            <p>Wow.  Two planes.  It is like the NZ 'trade delegation' think they are going to be returning with 50 'medical students' with visas tied to a sole employer (e.g., Calendar Girls), or something.</p>

                            <p> https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/national/remuera-homicide-murder-accused-philip-polkinghorne-seeks-advice-from-high-class-escort-s-lawyer/  Don't worry -- we have supervision for the 'medical students' all lined up.  He said he'd do it for free.  We wouldn't even need to pay him.  But silly silly of course we pay our most highly valued employees hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year so we can see the way that money flows around the economy in the name of 'trickle down economics'.  There really isn't anything here. </p>

                            <p>Apparently the GP's are due to retire soon.  I don't know how many of them are 65 already.  That means they don't have anything to lose.  Quickly quickly send the Doogie Hauser special special 14 year old medical students off for their internships in general practice.  It's soooooo competitive they best be willing to do anything anyting anything everything everything everything.  The GP's prooomise to retire real soon.  Yeah right.</p>

                            <p>How many decades did Kim Sterelny keep Carl Brusse enrolled and re enrolled and re enrolled and re enrolled in the doctoral programme at the ANU?  How many years?  How many decades?  How old is Kim Sterelny?  When did he turn 65?  How about his wife?  How many hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars for them.  How many millions.  Millions of dollars over how many years so that they could keep studnet slaves a slaving.  There really isn't anything there.</p>

                            <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/checkpoint/audio/2018895961/immigration-drive-hasn-t-recruited-a-single-gp-in-nearly-8-months  There isn't any shortage of people wanting to tell everyone they are a Medical Doctor.  You don't actually need to pay anybody to work that job, therefore.  You can get people to pass themselves off as in exhange for wink wink nudge nudge.  Get in there.  All the cervical examinations for the newborns, even.  Off you go.  Don't need to pay anybody to work in playing doctors and nurses, surely.    </p>

                            <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/492660/library-council-staff-rally-to-highlight-inadequate-wages-high-turnover  Silly silly sausages.  You don't stay for a career.  You stay because you have been placed in a government institution and there is no alternative.  A lifetime of abuse for you, therefore.  You lose.  Comprehnd.  Aye?  </p>

                            <p>The problem I have...</p>

                            <p>So, I have this problem, where I go along to Les Mills and there are group fitness instructors (or fitness models) there...  Amy and Sah...  And Amy is apparently or supposedly an emergency medicine physician.  But she is also scheduled in to teach a certain number of group fitness classes in the gym.  And I find myself wondering how she has the time and energy for it all.  I mean to say, most of the people who turn up to the gym as clients work a day job.  They work their day job and then they turn up for gym sessions.  But they turn up for gym sessions a bit beat up from their day jobs.  They don't turn up to gym sessions full of energy to get up on stage and lead the class.  </p>

                            <p>And I suppose the narrative is supposed to be that she is some kind of super special super human who is capable of working two full time jobs, effectively.  Only it doesn't actually make sense.  When does she get to study up on what is wrong with her patients?  It just doesn't make any sense at all.</p>

                            <p>And now Sah.  She's apparently a 4th year medical student.  So she's juggling studying for examinations and also clinical placements.  But she's also teaching however many group fitness classes at gyms across Auckland.  And you wonder how she does it.  Really.  How she can attend her internship requirement for a senior medical student and how she has the time to study up on medicine while working a full time job as a fitness model.  It just doesn't make any actual f*cking sense at all, truth be told.</p>

                            <p>So...  I did a year of sport and exercise science at Weltec.  Level 5 certificate.  They didn't want to pass me because I wasn't planning on sticking around for their Level 6 so the idea/l seemed to be to fail me, then, so I'd be forced to crawl back and re-do their level 5, then.  Anyway...  Their whole Les Mills thing.  Where you pay and you pay and you pay and you pay Les Mills. Firstly so you can be one of only a fixed number of personal trainers in the gym.  So competition for personal training is limited.  Secondly because of the opportunities to grow your personal training client base via group fitness instruction.  So the idea/l of that, then  is that you pay and you pay and you pay..  For videos and study materials for a particular release.  E.g., Less Mills The Trip Number 9.  Then you get the study materials you paid for.  Then you pay them to assess your performance doing the course with narration that you will use to instruct.  So you pay and you pay and you pay.  And maybe they say you are good enough.  So you are allowed to teach that particular release of that class.  So then your gym (in the US, say) can pay you (or not) to teach that release of that class.  But the basic idea is that there isn't a shortage of people wanting to tell everyone that they are fitness models.  So there isn't a shortage of people wanting to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the gym for study materials and assessments so they are certified to teach whatever fitness class.  Does Les Mills actually pay the instructors who teach their group fitness classes? </p>

                            <p>Well, now, that's an interesting question.</p>

                            <p>Firstly, I don't know the relationship between Les Mills International and the NZ chain.  The International one is subject to international regulations regarding slavery and the like because it is listed on the stock exchange.  I think that is correct.  But the NZ chain is not subject to those same regulations.  Is my understanding.  Not that regulations matter because the judciairy refuses to uphold them, but anyway...  </p>

                            <p>I have only seen Les Mills NZ (not anything from international) advertise for people in marketing or management.  I haven't seen them offering paid employment to fitness instructors or personal trainers or fitness models or anything like that.  You also don't see much advertised for medical doctors.  More recently, after I started saying about them not advertising.  Saying 'we are open to expressions of interest'  makes it all seem or sound really really really personal like they make you up a job if they like you, otherwise not.  Which seems to be the reality of the situation in fact.  Corruption.  Corruption.  Corruption.  What else isn't advertised?  MOst of the teaching work within the Universities.  Where do they advertise research funding applications?  You would think I would know as a former graduate research student of how many decades?  You would think I would know where to look for the calls for applications for research funding.</p>

                            <p>I would suppose the reserarch funding works like the scholarship funding.  You apply.  They either refuse to acknowledge your application else tell you that you weren't good enough to get the funding.  Then they write someone else's name on the funding application and give the funding to them.  Maybe to Kim Sterelny.  You get the idea/l.  </p>

                            <p>Waikato District Health Board likes to think they employ a number of academic researchers to do academic research.  I doubt that very much.  THey advertised a $5,000 masters research scholarship in 2018 where the recipient was supposed to present their masters work to the DHB as part of the award.  I have repeatedly asked them by way of OIA request for information who the receipient of the award was.  I was told my project (disabiltiy and equity for medicine and public health) wasn't the one most aligned with their research goals or interests.  They say they gave the money to someone in psychology.  I don't believe them.  WHere did the money go?  WHo was the named receipient?  It was for a 1 year research project.  Where is the project and what date did it start and what date did it stop?  When was the DHB meeting where the student got to present their research to the board?  THere isnt' anyting there.  COrruption.  Corruption.  COrruption.  Corruption.  COrruptoin.  ALl these f*ckign free-riders on payroll and they don't do any f*cking work.</p>

                            <p>I think in Wellington they were saying they kept close tabs on the number of people atending your class and if you grew atendees you kept your class and if people didn't turn up then you were removed from teachign that time slot.  I don't know how it works, now.  How many 'like share and subscribes'.  It was sooooo competititive.  In that way.  They churned through and bunrned through people instead of investing in a workforce, I mean to say.</p>

                            <p>Now?  I don't quite know.  Maybe even then...  It is a perk or similar for people on payroll for other things.  Sales or marketing or management or whatever.  Can teach a couple classes or something...  I don't know that they are paid, exactly, to teach them.  Again, there are no shortage of people wanting to tell everyone they are fitness models.  As there is no shortage of people wanting to tell everyone they are ER Physicians.  There is no shortage of people wanting to tell everyone they are diplomat to Ireland and they can do everything everything tehy want in the name of diplomatic immunity.  No shortage of people wanting to tell the world they are Judge.  Jury.  Also executioner.  With no accountability whatsover.  No shortage..  Why pay anybody to work those jobs when there is no shortage of people willing to work the job for free?  Work the job in the only way we care about it..  Just get in there and have a go...  Off you go....  What education and training system?  What judiciary?  What health system.  </p>

                            <p>So, I don't have a problem with Amy or with Sah.  They are pretty great group fitness instructos.  I hope they pay them.  Regarding their careers in emergency medicine or as medical students..  Well.  There isn't anything there.  Right?  I mean...  When do they have time to study medicine or do research on behalf of their patients?  We are supposed to believe they are superhuman but if you do the math it just doens't make sense.  Not enoguh hours in the day.  Double lives?  It just doesn't make any sense...  Set up to fail international exams (e.g., will never take the likes of the Step exam?  Yes..  That seems to be part of it.  Keep them too busy to actually study medicine.  Yeah.  For the good of..  Uh...  For the good of..  Uh..  For the good of who, again?</p>

                            <p>So...  Post Covid.  After the government ordered people to stay home and fired a bunch of people for non-compliance etc etc.  After people have learned about the corruption in NZ 'Universities' etc...  How many people will actually vote, do you think?  I mean, how many people are refusing to fill out Stats NZ surveys because they do not acknowledge the NZ governments authority?  How many people actually vote?  I think they need 5 % of the eligible population to actually cast a vote in order to claim to be a democratically elected government at all.  Do you think that 5 % of the eligible voting population will actually cast votes?  What democracy?  The people know it makes no F*cking difference.  Hey.  Corruption.  Corruption.  Corruption.  Corruptoin.  Corruption.</p>

                            <p>Now, How many GPS are 65 years or older and still on government payroll?  They refuse to sign off on new graduates because they insist there is no alternative to them.  Nobody else can do the job they do.  THey must continue to take hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year for them, therefore.  They refuse to sign off on anybody else.  Not  because they are still paying off the mortage on their first and modest home.  But because they are f*cking psychopaths.  Let's be clear.  All the time and effort and energy they have invested in over the years to keep up with modern medicine and do the best they could by their patients.  Yeah, right.  Couldn't f*cking slaughter them any faster.  It's soooooo competitive.</p>

                            <p>I wonder if the leader of China will tell Chris Hipkins to 'go home to his master' (as Winston Peters said about the leader of Taiwan) since it is in the Australian Constitution that NZL is the second named state which makes Chris not the leader of a Country, but of a state.  Actually I don't wonder.  We all know that the leader of China would not be so unprofessional as that.</p>

                            <p>We are supposed to believe that Jacinda voluntarily chooses to resign from the position that she has been elected to...  On the grounds of burn-out...  But now she's ready to work on a million dollar book contract for foreigners.  Instead of returning to her duties as elected Prime Minister of New Zealand to finish up her elected term?  HOw long is she supposed to take to write her book?  A decade?  Two?  Maybe $50,000 per year over 20 years... What is the value of a post-honorary-doc position, these days?  Only writing.  No research.  No teaching.  </p>

                            <p>Surely Justice Toogood isn't still paying off a mortgage.  On his 7th investment property after he paid off the mortgage on his 7 bedroom family home and his holiday house, perhaps...</p>

                            <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/492586/lack-of-data-on-medical-workforce-suicides-te-whatu-ora  Nonononono, you have to say it like this 'suicides'.  You can also say it like this 'people who have  been suicided'.  You know, all voluntarily-like.  Of course witnesses might upload evidence of the 'suicide' -- which would be swiftly declared unlawful and taken down.  As would any crime-scene forensic information posted by cleaners, say.  Such that people could consider whether the method claimed by the state appears to be consistent with the footage supplied by third party cameras and the like. </p>

                           <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/492602/thousands-of-acc-cases-probed-for-misuse-but-only-seven-prosecutions  I told ACC about the Auckland District Health Board incorrectly billing for me.  They billed ACC, saying I had conditions and they gave me treatments that were complete and utter fabrications.  I did not sign the consent form for any of it.  It was a complete and utter hoax.  I told the ACC and they just don't care.  It is like when you tell the IRD that the University is trying to have you charged for a programme of study that you never applied to.  They just don't want to hear it.  Unwilling / unable to keep accurate health records.  Of course they want to cry cry cry about the 65+ year old people who are still working to pay the bills.  The issue is not the 65+ people on the payrates that are needed to pay the reasonable bills, in fact.  The issue is the 65+ people on hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.  Judges that are suppose to have gotten out.  45 + years of highly paid employment as Judge ffs.  Time to get out.  Are we really expected to believe that the former speaker of the house was basically forced to be diplomat to Ireland because he's still trying to pay off his f*cking mortgage?  Ffs.  Time to get out.  Kim Sterelny and wife.  How old?  Time to get out.  Ffs.  It isn't exactly rocket science.  Interesting, though, to learn (maybe -- I'm skeptical of stats because they are often made up) that we have a higher proportion of retirement age people who refuse to get out than the USA.  I am interested in the breakdown of that regarding how many of them are living in houses where there is no mortgage on that home (thought I guess it is complicated when people buy investment property to have rental income as their own income by remortgaging their own home). </p>

                           <p>You  need to look at how the DHB's are billing ACC, rather than scapegoating a few individuals.  E.g., keeping people for cardiac observation in cardiology rooms when they have no grounds to suspect anything cardiac is wrong with them.  Ramping patients to keep the beds full to maximise their billings.  The cases of apparent or alleged fraud by particular individuals are NOTHING in comparaison to the systematic fraudulent billings by the DHB's.  similarly, I would imagine they are billing for surgeries that never were performed.  Placebo.  Give anasthetic. Make a surgical cut.  There's your placebo surgery.  Feel better.  That will be the cost of a full surgery, thanks.  Sign off on your surgical training, will we?  Yeah, right...</p>

                           <p>I guess the issue for me is the realisation that there simply isn't anything in healthcare or education...  Anything to do with vulnerable people.  Students.  Sick people.  Poor people.  Ethnic minority people. There just isn't any kind of shortage at all of people wanting identify vulnerable targets and get in there and take them for everything they have got.  We won't actually pay anybody to work those jobs (for or in the interests of the above people) because there never will be any kind of shortage at all of psychopaths who want to get in there and exploit them for everything they have.  So...  The positions will be filled with psychopaths.  Volunteers.  People who will 'yes sir yes sir everything you say sir' in exchange for getting to do anything anything anything.  The most valued Dr Leeks.  Moved to to Melbourne to better facilitate his continued ongoing crimes.  Most valuable employee ever.  This eye surgeon guy who is cohorting with Sydney prostitutes.  Let him be a motivation and inspiration to a bunch of young men who otherwise never would have considered Medicine as a viable profession, at all.  All the people he trained over the years?  Yeah, right.  </p>

                           <p>The recent inquiry into abuse in state care shows the lengths that the NZL government and judiciary will go to to ensure that NZ is the destination location for abusers and offenders and psychopaths and pedophiles...  It simply won't do anything about historic cases, even, and there is no intention whatsover of stopping with present abuses or developing any kind of education and training system or professional graduates with professsional careers.  There simply isn't anything here and there is no desire to develop, at all.  Can't function.  Taken over by psychopaths.  Not even trying to do things properly.  On shore prison camp detention land of Australia.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  Hire all the con-municators to say they can't see anything wrong.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                           <p>So... Usually the question from the rich people's spoiled kids is 'how much money would it cost to be leader of a little island far away from the laws and courts and so on of the USA so I can do anything anything anything I want...  Child porn..  Whatever drugs..   Torture.  ANything anything anything.  How much would it cost?'  To set yourself up as Epstein on the aptly named virgin islands.  Or maybe NZ.  How much money would it take to buy the election outright?  How much did kim.com think he could win it for?  I'm not sure...  But the point is that that usually is the idea.  How much money it would cost to have yourself positioned as dictator, basically, of an island.  How much money would it cost?  And we are expected to believe that Jacinda chooses to walk away from her position of leadership for a mere million dollars?  Makes no sense, hey.  Or, is she writing a defence of her actions for international community?  I guess the idea is that if they are all criminals they can all be removed from office at any time without much of any fuss.  Because you have the evidnece to prosecute them.  Like ensuring you only sign off on completion of Medical Degrees, say, once you have collected up enough evidence of them doing non-consenting procedures etc.  </p>

                           <p>The Junior Doctor from Dunedin (only one they would employ it's sooooo competitive) who was giving drugs he got from the hospital to teenagers.  Who killed one of the teenagers when she didn't want to have sex with him and threatened to tell everyone that he was doing these things...  The Junior Doctor who allegedly suicided in state care.  In prison.  There wasn't an open casket funeral so the parents of his victims could be satisfied that he actually was dead.  Was there?  He didn't just pay some sum of money in the form of bribe to flee.  Maybe to be relocated to Melbourne and set up with all the resources that he needed to drug teenagers and murder them off, over there?  The idea never would have occurred to me, but that seems to be the main motivating and inspiring reason to do Medicine, in NZ.  Wouldn't you say?  The courts don't see anything wrong with it...</p>

                           <p>They will not process applications to enrol according to criterion they published for the purposes of them being held accountable.  THey won't do it.  The courts will not hold them accountable.  They just won't do it.  There isn't anything there.  NOt even trying to be fair, at all.  They won't get students work out for external examination.  THey won't allow external examiners to sign off on qualifiation completions.  THey just won't do it.  Instead they pick out a few people and choose to award them the qualifications for reasons that are not transparent.  Which graduate research students from the Australian National University had their research sent out for external examination?  WHere are the external examiners reports?  WHen were the oral defences so that the students could defend their research projects in the face of external examination? When?  What 'University'?  WHy is Kim Sterelny still on payroll?  His 65th birthday was when?  WHy do they keep paying him hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year in base salary (with research grants in addition) when he was supposed to retire at 65?  How many years of overpaymant have their been?  How much money? So that his studnets can be re re re re re re re enrolled for more than a decade on their 3 year doctoral theses?  F*cking hell.  How retarded can some people be.  What education and training system?  Not behaviorally modern, indeed.  Indistringuishable from f*cking apes.  No kidding.</p>
