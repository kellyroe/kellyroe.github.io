 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2023/01/alleged-fraudulent-auckland-university-graduate-practised-psychiatry-in-uk-for-19-years-court-hears.html</p>

                                <p>Likely they wouldn't have hired her at all if they didn't think that she was a fraud.  I would imagine that when you are keeping institutions that are not even pretending to be theraputic so that you can torture people, effectively, and keep them punatively in conditions the UN would likely say amount to torture, then you have a certain special kind of staffing problem.  Wouldn't you say?  How are you going to find people willing to commit atrocities?  Or, at the very very least, willing to turn a blind eye to atrocities being committed by others?  I would imagine that you would have to find people willing to do anything anything anything anything.  Really train them up.  Teach them all about 'the other' and how badly you will treat them if they don't comply.
                                </p>

                                <p>Why are they going after her now?  All of a sudden?  What happened for them to declare her to be a fraud now, all of a sudden?  Time for them to pay her, was it?</p>

                                <p>The Calendar Regulations say they can hold you back for 1  year (make you repeat 1 year) of Medical School.  It does not make sense, therefore, that she would have dropped Medicine entirely after being failed for 1 year of the course when repeating the year (so the University can get more fees from you) is something that they do.  In fact, Didn't 1/3rd (at least) of the Medical Cohort of University of Otago fail their internship which meant their Degree was withheld?  They had recieved signoff from their internship placement but the University didn't accept that it was sending them to placements that the University would acknowledge (accused them not of paying bribes for sign off but of not doing enough work even though they had been signed off).  They wanted them to take up their junior doctor positions in the NZ hosptials, anyway, but they weren't going to pay them their junior doctor salary.  THey were going to need to keep paying the university.</p>

                                <p>There aren't that many psychiatrists in the world.  If she was accepted to train as a psychiatrist in the UK and she practiced in fact it is disingenuous to think or say that nobody knew of her or remembered her as having failed out if she did fail out in fact.</p>

                                <p>They intentionally select criminals so that they don't pay them.  Then they move them around so that again, they don't pay them.  Also, the whole doing anything anything anything anything anything.  Keeping people in punative conditions of torture and so on and so forth.  Nobody there.  Nothing home.</p>

                                <p>The USA has STEP examinations.  STEP 1 is a basic science subject knowledge test of medical science.  STEP 2 is clinical subject knowledge test of medical science.  STEP 3 is a mock clinical examination.  So that they can ensure that they only take people who try and give sexual health examinations to the toddlers and who don't ask informed consent etc.  Whatever it is that they value for wherever it is they want to deploy 'medical workforce' to manage the prison and detention camps, I would suppose.  Check what they have to say about how to write up patient notes to limit health coverage and so on and so forth.  THe UK has something similar, I think.  They don't have the teaching materials that the USA does with respect to at least nominally pretending to have an actual curriculum and examination scores that are some indicator of the curriculum contents that were taught.  She would have passed those exams in order to practice in the UK at all?  And she would have practiced in the UK for a couple years before being selected to Psychiatry.  It really isn't plausible to think that when a place is thinking of hiring someone they don't get people to contact the Univeristy that the person is from.  I mean to say, Martin Davies wouldnt' write me a reference to study in the USA because he thought I'd make a  better slave for AUstralia and the USA could just take my work, my research outputs etc etc anyway.  I imagine.  ANd I imagine that Kim Sterelny wants me to go begging and pleading.  People will do anything anything anything anything.  Right?  I wasn't supplicant enough.  Following him around all day like a lost puppy begging him to read my work and do his f*cking job supervising or at least getting the work to externals.  You know how it goes, the slave or prison camp of Australia.  Apparently if Carl spent 2x the normal time doing a PhD -- but then he got a PhD.  Right?  And now he has paid employment?  So they just get you slaving for a while..  ANd eventually they do pay you.   Riiiight.  Suuuuure.  LIke how my doing what Waikato wanted and writing them 2x the thesis over 2x the years meant they recorded that I failed.  ANd they still haven't gotten around to recording me as having been enrolled in the course of study that I actually applied to.  In fact thehy have recorded me being enrolled in a course that isn't even listedn in the University Calendar and doesn't have sensible course-codes.  There are no enrolmetn dated associated with the enrolment.  Indefinite detention.  My student ID card haven'e even expired yet.  Look at the expiration dates on the University of Waikato studnet identification cards that hey give you when you enrol in a 1 year programme of study.  </p>

                                <p>Nobody home.  Nothing there.  Is she getting to testify about atrocities in the hospitals?  Why are they going after her *now*?</p>

                                <p>The 'Universities' of NZ (Haha) are wanting to keep online records only, now.  A potential employer is supposed to put in a records request with the University and the Univeristy will tell that prospective employer whatever they want about you.  SO, for instance, they can tell prospective employers that you are a nasty criminal degenerate if they want you to have no option but to stay and slave for them.  Why would they want to give up their slaves?  And the ones they want to get rid of..  Glowing references, I suppose.  Send off the problems, right? </p>

                                <p>How do you get signed off in NZ when the tutor is teachign you to grope people doing cardiac exams?  How do you get signed off in NZ when the tutor is teachign you to do cervical exams on patients anesthetised for unrelated procedures when they ahve not provided informed consent?  If they won't sign off on your committing atrocies (just like them) then how can you get your qualification from teh 'University'?  What Uniersity?  They are trying to keep more and more and more and more slaves and prisoners in the detention camps up and down the land..  What education and training system? What garduates?  What jobs?  There's nothing there...  Nobody home.</p>

                                <p>They wouldn't accept or acknoweldge when teh studnets had completed things to the satisfacation of international community.  Locally.  They won't accept it.  They say that their studnets are garbage garbage garbage garbage rubbish useless stupid lazy incompetent criminals.  Garbage garbage garbage.  Therefore they must be kept here as slaves.  Kept in teh prison detention camp because it's so fun to abuse them.  Garbage wasteland.  There's nothing here.  THere is nothing at all even trying ot be rehabiliattive or educational or healthy or helpful about any of this.  It's just soooooo cmopetitive.  Poking each others eyes out.  Soooooo cmopetitive.  Soooooo competitive.  Wehre does all the money go?  Of ocurse it's not really about money.  It's about power to do anything anything anything.  HOw some peopel need to feel big about themselves.</p>
