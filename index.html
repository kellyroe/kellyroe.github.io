 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->

                            <article>
                                <p>
                                    How much research work are you supposed to do for a 120 point Masters Qualification?  How about a 240 point 2 year Masters Qualification (with one year of course work and one year of research)?  How much work are you supposed to do for a 360 point thesis (extendible to 480 points)?  You are supposed to work for a time...  1 year or 2 years or 3 years or 4.  And then they are supposed to get your work out to external examiners so that it can be assessed on it's academic merits and they can decide whether you have done enough work for credit, or whether you have been loafing and not doing your work.
                                </p>

                                <p>I started my PhD with the Australian National University in 2006 (after working for more than 2 academic years on a 120 point Masters Research project) and the Australian National University never got my work out for external examination.  Never did.  You can see a more than 100,000 word document that I gave to my supervisor on the writing page.  He never got it to externals, never gave me comments on it.  Nothing.  I left Australia without it going out to externals for external examination at all.   
                                </p>

                                <p>Lots of students did.  Left Canberra before their thesis was sent out for external examination -- if it ever was.  I'm not actually sure whether any of the doctoral studnets work was actually sent out for external examination, or how they were picking and choosing what students they were acknowledging as having done enough for a PhD.  I mean to say, I remember Nick Southwood saying that he did everything his supervisor told him to do (as did I) and he had been informed that the external examiners had accepted his thesis without any changes or alternations being required to it, at all.  I am not sure how plausible this is now, however.  I guess I think it was actually more likely that they never sent it out for external examination at all.   They simply told him that he had done enough for a PhD.  None of the Australian National University doctoral students had oral examinations or defences at the end of their PhD.  So nobody from overseas or international community actually got to question them about their doctoral research to even see if they understood the work that they were credited as being the author of.  It seemed to be at the discretion of their supervisor to say they had done enough. </p>


                                <p>
                                You can see on the seminars page various seminars that I wrote while I was a PhD student in Australia.  Written talks that I read to various conferences.  The work that I did while I was at the ANU working on a 3 or 4 year research PhD program.  How much work are you supposed to do for a PhD?  How many seminars (articles) are enough?  You can also see a book chapter with OUP where I was a co-author.  You might say 'they didn't send your work out for external examination because they themselves judged it to be garbage'.  But the thing is that it is supposed to be externally examined by people who don't have an interest in keeping their research students slaving for them handing all their work over to their supervisors without their supervisors acknowledging them as the author of the work at all.  Who knows what the supervisors do with the work they get from students (or people submitting to their journals).  Take it for themselves or reattribute it to their friends.  Keep it as trophies in their basement?  It needs to be externally and independently examined because otherwise the supervisors keep slaves.  Obviously.  Never sign off on their students.  Or, what?  It is at their discretion whether or not their studnets are acknowledged as the author of their own work?  Relies on their good-will?  The kindness of their hearts?  What do you have to do then?  Anything anything anything?  Pay a bribe?  Go camping?  Just one more camping trip?  One more drink? </p>

                                <p>My work was judged to be of high enough quality by the ANU from my writing samples for me to be given a summer research scholarship to the ANU.  And my research over the summer and my subsequenet writing samples were judged to be of high enough quality by the ANU for me to be enrolled there to work on my doctoral thesis.  And my progress was deemed to be enough for them to keep enrolling me and keep me working in the programme.  For how many years?  And then (after I've been working for many years in excess) they say that I'm garbage and rubbish.  When it is time for them to credit me as having done enough for a PhD so I can be applying for tenured positions and research positions.  That's a convenient time to bully someone into not having credit because you think they are garbage.  Corruption. </p>

                                <p>Apparently the issue is that there will be a job for me over there dead bodies.  They have tenured positions.  They apply for and get all the research funding.  Them and the people who depend or rely on them.  Their dependents.  There is no alternative to them and their dependents.  They don't sign off on independents.  They keep dependents only. </p>

                                <p>When I returned to NZ I wanted to train to do Medicine.  Something with an academic and also practical aspect or element.  There is a shortage apparently.  Unlike philosophy positions where there are more people with Philosophy PhD's than there are academic posts in Philosophy so even if you have a PhD there likely won't be an academic post or position for you.  You'd have to wait for the people currently in those posts or positions to die.  Is what they keep telling me.  Job for you over our dead bodies.  We are the only game in town.  All the money for us.  All the money for us to keep studnets re-enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled.  I wanted to do something practical to help people.  Learn and have knowledge and help other people obtain the information they need to make informed health decisions.  I was told by Auckland University that I needed to complete a new qualification form a NZ university to be 'eligible' to apply to Medicine.  I asked specifically if a 120 point MPhil from Waikato would be enough and they said it would.  So I applied to enrol in that.  I worked on it from 05 March 2018 under supervision (have emails from my supervisor directing me to finding readings and acknowledging recepipt of my writing) and the University refused to get my thesis submission of 14 September out for external examination.  </p>

                                <p>They said I needed to keep working or I would never get credit for completing a Masters thesis.  I kept working (did what they said) and they send 05 October Masters thesis submission out for instructions for externals to examine it as a 'doctoral thesis'.  Since the externals were required to examine the masters thesis as a doctoral thesis they could only say that more work would be needed.</p>

                                <p>So I keep working on the thesis.  THey refuse to get my thesis submission of 05 January out to external examiners.  They refuse to get my thesis submission of 24 January out to external examiners.  They send the June 30 thesis submission out for 'masters examination' (So it would be externally examined for 3 months after I had been working on it for well over 1 year) and the interntional external examiner says that at that point they want an oral examination.  The New Zealander external examiner says that she accepts that the University of Waikato failed me.  The University of Waikato updates my transcript to say that I was enrolled in various programmes of study I never applied to be enrolled in (much more than 120 points of MPhil) and that I failed.  F.  They are keeping false student enrolment records and false transcripts and they are refusing to get studnets work to external examiners who can examine it on it's academic merits. </p>
 
                                <p>The external NZ examiner was Carolyn Mason of Canterbury.  She was supposed to be anonymous but the University made the information availabe to me over student portal at one point.  I wonder what Carolyn Masons research output was over the 2018 academic year.  She thinks there are too many problems with giving me credit or recognition or qualilfication for having done 1 year of research in 2018.  What research did she do to justify her being paid a tenured position as a philosophy academic, then?  University employees primary function is supposed to be research.  What research did she do, then, that she thinks she should get tenure while I should be sent away from the University without any credit at all for the 1 year research that I did.  Where is her students work that was signed off as being enough for a 1 year masters, then?  Show me the work that was signed off as being enough for a 1 year masters.  I want to see it.  So we can compare the quality of my academic work with the quality of others who were signed off.  Oh..  Nobody was signed off.  Is that right?  There will be a job for other people only over her dead body.  All the money is her entitlement, you see.  So nobody else can be signed off as having completed any research.  She can be the only applicant for research funding.  Only game in town.  Nobody else applied for that position.  </p>

                                <p>The Vice Chancellor tells me to complain to the Ombudsman and the courts if I have a problem with how the University of Waikato isn't getting studnets work out to externals, isn't keeping accurate enrolment records and transcripts and the like.  The Ombudsman delays things for a year and doesn't see anything wrong (that seems to be why they pay him).  I took them to court, then, and Justice Toogood is reappointed from retirement (I don't suppose they signed off on anybody else's law degree, so there wasn't a new person to be appointed, a new person would be appointed only over Justice Toogood's dead body, apparently).  He doesn't see anything wrong with the death of Olivia Podmore (apparently she suicided but they won't release her health records to her parents) or with the death of Mason Pendrous (he rotted for a month in a residential hall.  Justice Toogood says they don't know when he died.  But he was a computer science person living in a University Hall so they would have been able to see when he stopped using his University internet).  Justice Toogood doesn't see anything wrong with the Univesrity of Waikato not getting studnets research out to externals, getting students research out to externals with instructions for them to examine it for the wrong qualification (so they can only say that more work is needed).  He doesn't have any problem with them keeping false enrolment records and false transcripts. </p>

                                <p>Turns out that the Education and Training Act states actually pretty clearly that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are in fact eligible to be enrolled in the program they have applied to.  In other words, the University of Auckland wrongly decided the outcome of my applications in 2019 and 2020.  They said I was 'ineligible' because I hadn't done enough work for the masters qualification and then because Waikato said they failed me for the Masters qualification but that is ultra vires because they don't get to decide eligibility for domestic adults.  I was eligible by statute.  Therefore they were required to apply the selection algorithm they published for selection.  They simply refused to do that.  They refused to enter my GPA into the system (last 2 years of full time study).  Would not do it.  Justice Fitzgerald acknowledged that they did not have authority to deem me eligible but she refused to find that they were required to actually process my application according to their published selection criterion and actually enrol me if my rank order score was high enough.  I likely was, which is, of course, why they refused to apply their published selection algorithm to my application.</p>

                                <p>Instead, I suppose they gave the training place that should have gone to me (if and only if my rank order score was high enough) to some surgeons son, or whatever.  Because there will be a job for new medical graduates only over the dead bodies of those who are currently on payroll to work those jobs.  </p>

                                <p>How much work are you supposed to do before you are allowed to apply for research funding?  The people getting all the funding at the moment ensure that no new applications are received.  Unless they are from people who appear obviously to be less capable else unless they are from their own dependents.</p>

                                <p>Corruption.  There is actually nothing here.  We have these people in position and they don't do the job for which they are paid.  But they take all the money for themselves.  They try and identify anyone with the capacity to do the job better than them and exterminate or annihiliate those people.  Bully them away.  Take their work outputs and steal them for themselves or give them away.  The judiciary in NZ fails to function.  They refuse to do anything about this situation.  Indeed, Justice Toogood (also Mander, I think) were specifically pulled out of their retirement and put back on payroll to refuse to accept the evidence I brought before them, refuse to acknowledge half the statutory laws.  What is the worst thing that can happen to them failing to find in the interests of justice?  Removal from office?  They werne't supposed to have been re-appointed back into office, anyway.  So they have nothing to lose.</p>

                                <p>We have these people in positions of power holding everyone else hostage.  We don't really have to wonder whhy there aren't any doctors, teachers, lawyers..  There really doesn't seem to be anything anything anything at all.  'Trickle down economics' apparently.  Where some people just take a big piss all over everybody else.  Not even trying to develop better Universities or whatever.  Just taking everything out of it.  Costly fitness trap, Sterelny would say.  Yes.  That is what he is, indeed.  That's why he's on payroll.  Right?  Better give him all your research work, then, so he can refuse to acknowledge you as the author of it.  So he can give it to other parties etc etc.  I'm sure Victoria University of Wellington wouldn't have  put him on payroll for however many years it did if he hadn't have played his part in the keeping of slaves.</p>

                                <p>So the government keeps me on disability, apparently.  Because it won't acknowledge the work that I've done.  No credit for me.  I'm such a slow worker that they don't acknowledge any research output from me, at all.  THey don't acknowledge my masters research our doctoral research.  I did a different masters research for Waikato before I went to Australia to work on my PhD.  I mean to say, Auckland wanted me to repeat a masters level qualifiation after I'd done one already because they said that they thought that qualifications expired and were no longer acknowledge 5 years post-graduation.  That was why I needed to do a second masters, apparently.  TO be 'eligible' to study Medicine.  Where is the previous masters?  It wasn't in the Univesrity of Waikato Philsophy Department.  The University of Waikato is not acknowledging the research outputs of the studnets.  So that they can keep people on payroll who don't output any research at all. Where is Justine Kingsbury's research output for 2018?  What research did she do in that year?  Why is she on payroll when she doesn't do any research?  So that she can keep students and refuse to get the students work to external examiners  because there will only be  job for them over her dead body.</p>

                                <p>It's sooooooo competitive.  Apparently.  The race to the bottom.  The keeping of slaves.  All of the money and none of the work.  All of the work and none of the credit or recognition.  It was AFTER I wrote my 1 year research on disability and equity in medicine and public health that there was a report commissioned by the government on the topic.  Where is my credit?  Where was my research funding? Why do I have levels of debt recorded against my name only more and more and more and more debt to the University while they take my work and payroll people who don't do any?  I understand that they don't like what I have to say.  They don't have to like it to acknowledge that I did it.  I did the work.  Research output isn't supposed to be a bunch of 'yes sir yes sir everything you believe is true sir'.  Apparently Ashley Bloomfield was recently hired by Auckland University as an academic.  Where is his research  output?  Where is his MD or PhD?  Why is he qualified to be a university academic?  Because all he has to do is take his studnets work and give it away (e.g., hand it over the kids of Princeton or wherever to pass off as their own ) or pass it off as his own, or give it to his friends.  Or keep it in a trophy cabinet and not show it to anyone.  The author will get credit as having done it only over the authors dead body.  It's sooooooo competitive.</p>

                                <p>There is actually nothing there. It's just a big scummy scam.  Instead of the government paying people to work jobs they get people paying the university so that levels of debt are recorded against their name only while they hand their work over to the university else while they do work in the name of internships.  The University keeps them doing far in excess of what they were supposed to do (keeps them in excess of 1 year for 1 year credit, excess of 4 years for 4 years credit) etc.  Simply refuses to give any credit at all.  In order to payroll people who don't do any of the work.  Keeping of slaves.  HOstages.  That's the basis of the NZ economy.  What economy?  Australia isn't any better.  Can't see that the UK or US is or wants to be.  There's simply nothing there. Scummy hoax of a scummy scam.</p>

                                <p>In NZ more and more people aren't being paid for work they  have done.  The government simply won't pay them.  Teachers and the like.  The government won't pay them.  They take their employer to the employment court but even if the employment court finds that they were correct punishes them for having brought the case before the courts.  I mean to say (example) if they don't pay them $10,000 then the courts will find that they are to pay them $10,000 (maybe) - but the person who brought the case needs to pay their lawyers out of their own pocket (more than $10,000, say) and needs to pay the filing fees and costs out of their own pocket (even more than $10,000 for sure).  So they end worse off financially for having complained.  Which is the real point, of course.  To teach people that if they complain about being slaves they will only be treated worse.  If you complain about having to housesit for you supervisor,  having to feed their cats.  Having to go away on camping trips.  Having to go out to dinners and lunches and drinks.  Having to hand over many more years work than the 3 or 4 it was supposed to be.  While the supervisor simply says 'keep working keep working keep working there will be a job for you only over my dead body' then what are you supposed to do?  Oh.  Turn and walk away.  Until they find some new incompetent slaver to take their place.  There's nothing there. </p>

                                <p>Work hard everybody!  Pay ya later!</p>

                                <p>It doesn't even make any sense that there be a health system.  Only over there dead bodies.  It's soooooo competitive.  Only over there dead bodies.  They aren't going to pay the studnet ambulance drivers etc so how are they supposed to find their money?  They aren't going to pay the student nurses or doctors or whatever so how are they supposed to make their money?  Corruption...  There's nothing here...</p>

                                <p>The court of appeal ordered me to pay around $27,000 to have various cases against NZ Universities and the Vice Chancellor's Committee progress through the court of appeal.  The Social Security Appeals Authority has delayed things for over 1 year.  It has been more than 4 months since a substantive hearing and they have still not produced a judgment.  They don't think that justice is an essential need, you see.  So there isn't any problem with NZ not having a functioning judiciary.  WIth them not paying lawyers or judges.  Maybe they don't actually pay Justice Toogood when he writes a report saying he doesn't see anything wrong with the deaths of Olivia or Mason.  Maybe they don't actually pay him when he says he doesn't see anything wrong with Waikato not getting students work out to externals while they keep people on payroll who are not doing research, who are only preventing and prohibiting anybody else from being seen to be doing any research.  Maybe he does it out of his own desire to have his day in court.  I don't know if he even writes his own judgements or is simply acknowledged as the author of them.  Who knows who writes them.  I suppose some law studnet who has been told that they are to keep writing reports seeing nothing wrong otherwise they never will get their law degree.</p>

                                <p>So I guess it's time for a draft, then.  We are going to need a bunch of people to all voluntarily-like die so that certain special other snowflakes can have the lives they believe they are entitled to, else the lives they believe they are lucky enough to have found themselves living even if that means that various other people can have nothing or simply be sent off to slaughter.  It simply isn't plausible that now, where there is more co-operation or co-operativity or co-ordination interntionally...  THings like computer chips and so on.  THe internatinoal co-operation.  It simply isn't plausible (New Zealand Government) that there needs to be a draft so that you can send all the people off to die now that it's time for you to f*cking well pay them.</p>

                                <p>Various people need to stand down.  Only, that's not the thing, really.  It should not be a matter of personal conscience.  There should be systems and processes in place that allow for meritocray.  External examination by people who don't have financial or other insterests in keeping the person enslaved or recognised only after they have died.  Things haven't changed in NZ since the time of Janet Frame ffs.  When it was time for them to pay her (to teach and ideally to get creative arts funding for creative outputs) they threw her into an institution and kept her punatively.  Punatively.  What health system?  What judiciary?  What Universities?  There's nothing here.  Just a bunch of people paid far far far more than they are worth to keep slaves hostage.  Anti-meritoctracy.  We know that merit and intelligence and the like is not particularly hereditary.  Because of the lengths people go to when it comes to neptosm.  If things really were hereditary then there wouldn't be all these things in place in order to prevent and prohibit meritocracy.  People wouldn't need to throw away various other applications and various other applicants if their kids really were most meritous, you see.  And there shouldn't be any problem signing off on and acknowledging the merits and talents of other people including new people if those in the positions of power actually were most meritous.  INstead of being appointed into postion only to eliminate the competition, you see. It's sooooo competitive.  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>They joke about the 'bums on seats funding'.  That the government pays the universities money to babysit people, effectively.  Keeps the crime rate down.  They are in class.  Also the idea that the government actually sees university studnets as bums.  They are only enrolled in University (higher and higher levels of debt against their name)  because if they don't agree to sign up for training courses the government threatens to keep them on unemployment.  If they are on unemployment then the government will find a job for them.  Likely a 'job' that pays them less than they are required to pay their 'employer' for working that job.  I mean to say, you pay your employer for parking and for your uniform and for your laundering of the Uniform.  Maybe for food.  Maybe compulsory drinks.  No?  Otherwise..  I'm sure there is some individual who the government plays soooooooo muuuuuuuch to, so that they can keep you, then, on 'mates rates' rent in their house?  Maybe their bedroom, then?  Does that sound like a good idea?  Is that a nice thing to do to or for the PhD students who give you thesis (book) after thesis (book) after seminar (chapter, article) so that you can pay and pay and pay and pay the likes of Justine Kingsbury to tell everyone how they don't have the ability to think critically.  HOw this is a bad argument and that is a bad argument.  Fill up an entire course with bad arguments so that people get exposed to all the worst of the bad arguments.  Quite the curriculum you have, there, at the fine institution you like to call 'university'.  That won't get studnets work out to international community.  Because it is determined that there be nothing here.</p>

                                <p>So what did Jacinda do to get a PhD then?  It was an honor bestowed upon her publically in exhange for her reading the teleprompts in public.  So far as I can see.  To announce to the Harvard Medical Graduates, Biology Graduates, that noboody would be prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus, in NZ.  They can then look into things relatively easily and discover that nobody ever was.  Even though it was a criminal offence up until relatively recently.  NZ doesn't have a functioning health system or judiciary.  THey can come here and do anything anything anything they like.  By teh seems of it.  That's what it means to have a PhD from Harvard.  Apparently.  Where is her PhD?  Her research output?  Where is her thesis?  How about Ashley's?  Not Universities.  Not places of higher learning or research at all.  Not even trying to train a workforce.  Trying to keep slaves.  All of the work for none of the credit while recording only higher and higher and higher levels of debt against their name.  There's nothing.  Nothing worth working towards or working for.  There isn't a health system.  It's sooooo cmopetitive.  THey won't pay them.  Kickstart a gofund me for the hostages.  </p>

                                <p>The Minister for Justice and Minister for the Courts say that they can't remind the Judiciary on timely judgment expectations because that would be against the principle of the independence of the Judiciary.  So, then, what is the function of the Minister for Justice and Minister for the Courts?  If they can't so much as remind the courts on expectations for timely judgment delivery then what on earth are they doing?  What can they do?  What is the point purpose or function of having Ministers in those positions?  I suppose given the state of corruption it likely is that the Ministers do in fact use political power or pressure to alter the outcome of judgments else to prevent and prohibit the delivery of judgments.  There's really nothing here.  I don't know why we would think that they would actually count the election votes.  The supposedly elected representatives (Ayesha Verral was elected?) don't seem to care at all what the public think of them.  Why?  Because this is NZ and there is no alternative.  By design.  It's just a Harry Harlow social engineering research experiment in the prevention and prohbition of social development.  Fisher and Paykal incubator babies.  I'm so glad I'm a gamma baby you don't know how lucky you are to be a New Zealander-land.</p>

                                <p>You have teachers who say they aren't comfortable teaching reading writing or arithmetic.  If they were comfortable or confident in these things they wouldn't be primary teachers.  Sometimes they say that.  But the ones with tenured positions have how many paid employment weeks per year where they are not having to front up to kids in the class?   I mean to say they are paid a yearly salary so they have a lot of time that is teaching recess so they can brush up on their reading writing and arithmetic skills.  But they won't.  And the ones who would make that kind or sort of use with that time are kept on temporary contracts where they are only paid during teaching weeks to do teaching weeks.  People on term contracts or whatever.  Who aren't paid over the teaching recesses.  To ensure they keep the basic standard of teaching low etc.  So the people with all the money and power can feel like they are the most meritous.  Justified.  Entitled.</p>

                                <p>National does not want the kids to do reading writing or arithmetic any more than there is no alternative Labor does.  They don't want people understanding any more math than that they are to be held or kept in negative numbers paying their employer having more and more and more levels of debt recorded against their name only.  They don't want people reading the statutes and reading the judges the law.  There is nothing actually here, at all.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>
