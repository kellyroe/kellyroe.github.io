                        <div class="container">

                            <p>Is Nieve even Jacinda Ardern's baby at all?  I mean, if people were to do the genetic test..  Or was she uplifted from someone else.  Stolen into 'state care' and then trafficked internationally.  Where is Nieve now?  I mean...  Who takes their baby along to the UN and presents it to a meeting of the UN.  Usually NZ presents to the UN having a yakkity yak yak about how it's culturally normal and expected and required to abuse children and adults and everyone really.  Culture of abuse.  PUnative punative punative.  It's being 'friendly' we know how Kiwi love to be kept...  Who takes their infant along to the UN and presents an infant to the UN in the meeting of the UN?  WHo does that?  WHere is Nieve now?  How much money did she fetch on the market?  She's 6 now?  7?  SO she's enrolled in school?  No..  We've changed the laws on that, I suppose.  She's not going to go to school at all?  She's to be kept at home?  IN what country, exactly?  How much money did she get for you?  For who??  On the market.  Not even trying to be fair at all, hey.</p>

                            <p>It is better to limit face to face interaction to limit their opportunities for them to be unprofessional.   If you limit your interaction to written communication so that there is a record of what was said.  So how I've posted up some of the conversation that transpired during my 2018 enrolment with Waikato.  How they get their lawyers to send me letters saying they will keep me enrolled as a masters level student indefinately under the zero fee scheme.  Saying how I am required to pay them fees in addition to those associated with the 120 point programme that I applied to -- otherwise I will never receive the Degree.  I have a written record of them saying all that. I even have a written record of me supplying this information to the Courts.  To the 'Judge' that is supposed to have been retired.  Hauled out of retirement to not see anything wrong.  There will be justice only over his dead body, it seems.  ALl the very very very very best of the aged care that he orders for everybody else for him!  F*cking psychopath.  There isn't anything here.</p>

                            <p>Oh well if you don't present in person to be physically and sexually molested and denigrated and so on..  TO be told what a f*cking c*nt you are (right, Sterelny?  That's how we talk to our 'students' in our great 'apprenticeship system'?) then you can talk to a chat-bot then.  Hahahhahahahahhaha.  How f*cking clever, hey.  There's nothing here.</p>

                            <p>It's funny, isn't it.  All the jobs that there aren't, in NZ.  All the positions that are not there.  Ones they don't advertise, at all.  For example, they don't seem to advertise for tutors or graders or lecturers or researchers, even, at any of the 'Universities'.  The positions are given to people in-house and they don't advertise for people to fill the positions at all.  They aren't interested in hiring those most qualified or experienced or knowledgeable for the positions.  They will hire second year students to teach first year students.  So the first year studnets need to ask the second year students to shut up during labs, for example,  because the second year students were yakkity yak yak yakking through the demonstration.  Maybe they were prefects of their private school.  THey seemed to think that being appoined to position to lord over the first years was precisely that.  Like giving the keys to the first year girls rooms to the second year boys in the name of them being picked out to be leaders of the residential halls.  There so the girls can have a yakkity yak yak to them after being drugged and raped during orientation week by so and so's son (a fellow student) or was it his father..  Or who knows... Really..  THe proffessionalism..  No, that's not it.  The complete and utter lack of professionalism.  Not even trying to pretend to be professional, at all.  What Univesrity?  What edcuation and training system?  How do they make their decisions as to who to enrol and who not to enrol?  It isn't academic merit based because they refuse to allow their students to have their work externally independnetly examined on the basis of it's academic merits.  They refuse to do it.  Won't do it.  Will not allow it.  ONly the unprofessional psychopaths and abusers and so on need apply.  Right?  Simply will not do it any other way.  SO..  Where are teh employment postings?  For teachers and tutors and lecturers adn research?  Where are the lists of scholarship recipients?  They aren't paying the money to the studnets at all. Who was the recipient of the 2 year Masters in Leadership to the Kennedy School or whatever it was at Harvard?  That was supposed ot be to the value of a couple hundred thousand USD.  Who was the recipient?  Was there one?  WHERE DID THE MONEY GO??  It wasn't about the money, you see.  Insfoar as USD is a way to track corruption.  Who paid the USD to have Jacinda's entourage travel around on domestic flights within the US?  WHo paid for that?  Who paid for her graduation gown?  Her hotel stay in teh vicinity?  Corruption.  Corruption.  Corruption.  Corruption.  Corruptoin.  There isn't anything here.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                            <p>I guess Apple has the information provided (or not) about what clinical research trials people are signed up for.  Do we still think that people have the right not to be subject to 'medical' experimentation?  I don't think we do, do we?  We don't believe in human rights.  We don't actually see any people.  There aren't any.  You just take what you can for as long as you can because you can until you get got.  Then you go away.   Not exactly behaviorally modern, eh, Sterelny?  The selfish selfish selfish selfish selfish.  They will fund that.  Most brilliant idea that anybody's had in socio-biology since the 1960's or something.  How old is Dawkins, now?  Him and his selfish selfish selfish.  Oh well, I guess when we tire of that ideology we can listen to you go on about all the things that you think go into a training and apprenticeship system.  Of which we have none of.  Only over your dead body.  Right?  That's what you always say..  Lots of old men will need to die before there will be a  job for you.  Selfish selfish selfish selfish selfish selfish selfish.  If you don't want to help me with my thesis and you don't want to try and teach me anything and you only want to try and get me to go camping and looking after your house and so on (that's what you did to Carl Brusse over decades also, right)?  F*cking psychopath.  F*cking die already.  What would you say?  I think people know what Sterelny would say something about  him having 'f*cked the dog you f*cking c*nt'.  He's real eloquent like that.  I can see why they pay him.  And pay him and pay him and pay him and pay him and pay him and pay.  I find it really hard to believe that he was the author of much of what they claimed to be his research output.  I think the scam goes that people send their work to the Journal and he arranged for them to be bullied to death, or similar, so he can reattribute authorship to other people.  I guess that is why they won't do oral defence examinations at the ANU.  Because asking people questions about their work is one way to check if they actually understand it.  If they were the author of it etc.  None of the studnets work was sent out to externals for external examiantion -- was it?  I don't recall going to a single studnets oral defence.  I remember people visiting a lot from the NOrthern Hemisphere.  Keen for coffee and morning tea and afternoon tea.  Dinner.  Drinks.  Keen to go off on camping trips.  Fly around Australia and the world in the name of conference.  Then, often, to not go to other people's talks and to go off sightseeing on the University's dime.  What Universities?  Taken over by f*cking psychopaths, for sure.  What research output?  Hurry up and f*cking well die, already.  There isn't anything there.</p>

                            <p>So, I hear the Prime Minister of the Country-State of Tasmania had this bright idea to ship the people off to New Manus Island as volunteers to continuet to keep the detention camp facilities running, over there.  Because they didn't see any people...  The local people from the region.  They weren't marching on TV about how they are people and sick and tired of being lorded over by Australians shipped there to lord over the off-shore detention camp slave colony of New Manus Island and so on.  With the greatest literary output of all coming out of someone not kept on payroll to write a book on his cell-phone, or something.  Research output exceeded that of the entire 'University' English Department, I'm sure.  I guess it's like how they pay Chris Whelan hundreds of thousands of dollars per year NOT TO PROCESS complaints of wrongdoing when he had one f*cking job to do.  The prevention and prohibition of that job.  Check out what he has done to completely and utterly undermine the education and training system of NZ.  He's not a kiwi is he?  Is he English?  SHipped here to undermine so that the pretty pretty little girls can be shipped to Oxford and Cambridge and the like to entertain the 65 +++ year old guys who promise to retire in the next 45 years, or so...  Yeah, right.</p>

                            <p>I mean, what is the criterion by which they make their decisions?  They are quick to tell people that they didn't get a place in the programme because their grades weren't good enough.   But when it turns out they aren't calculating the GPA the way they themselves say they will they won't put it right.  Instead of putting it right they will spend tends of thousands of taxpayers dollars asserting their right to enrol and not enrol whoever they want for whatever arbitrary reasons they have.  So, then, if it isn't about GPA what is behind the decisions they are making?  Justice Toogood got pulled out of retirement and put back on payroll.  I can only suppose it is because he doesn't feel that he has anything to lose.  He is supposed to be retired.  They are supposed to appoint someone else into the position.  Doesn't he have anybody who he has trained over his many many many years of service who could do the job he has done?  WHere are all his graduated apprentices?  What's that?  He ate them all, did he?  WHere are they?  Warwick Bagg...  Wanted to have a yakkity  yak yak yak to me after the University of Auckland refused to calculate my GPA.  I let him know about it in time for them to fix it.  Do something about it.  The first day the University was open in January of 2019.  You guys didn't calculate my GPA properly.  They didn't calculate it properly prior, either, trying to get out of interviewing me.  Two days after interviews had started.  Where is my interview?  Trying to tell me I didn't meet the GPA cut off for interview? FFS.  Will not process applications.  But now, apparently, the government is on the campaign trail.  ANd how they think they will win votes is explaining to the junior doctors that they aren't actually going to pay them.  THey are just going to replace them with new studnets.  They will lpay and pay and pay and pay and pay the University and be put to work pretending to be doctors (passing them off as when they don't have keys to the medical supply cabinet and they can't order any tests of procedures)...  They can tell all their friends they are a doctor and maybe women will throw themselves at them in the bar...  I mean who wouldn't want to marry a doctor?  Or give their 14 year old special child over to one to have custody and do a little anything anything anything for the weekend.  Why is Warwick Bagg back on payroll to take more and more and more and more money for keeping Medical Students?  How old is he?  WHy is he choosing the ones he does?  More than a little creepy, wouldn't you say?  Where are his former students?  Did he eat them?  Where are the apprentices he's trained over the years?  What education and training system ffs.  Where are teh graduates?  WHere are the kiwi trained doctors? Oh, no speak English.  Can't speak English.  Nobody (except Professor Glue's Glue Factory) seems to do much int eh way of speaking English for Psychiatry.  Where is Uffindell now?  Has he been redeployed to Education and Training?  Identifying the abusers and doing everything he can to give them second and third and fourth chances at offending.  Most high valued employee who will do anything anything in exhance or return for getting to do anything anything in return.  So long as it's bullying and abusive, of course.  What education and training system?  Where are all the graduates?  They can't even / won't even calculate a GPA.  Nobody there.  Nothing home.  Manufacturing LSD as a psychological treatment?  What are we back in the f*cking 1960's?  Much research was done back then.  O'Leary etc etc drugging the pretty little girls they enrolled from their photos before they refused to graduate them in case they spoke out about the crimes.  Wouldn't even get the work out for external examination ffs.  What education and training system?  Nothing there.  Nobody home.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>What did the GP's learn?  The ones who are due to retire.  What did they learn?  'I'm sorry it's probably a virus there isn't anything we can do'.  Not doing health checks.  Putting in a referral for specialist tests or treatments.  What do the GP's do, again?  Not doing the cancer screenings.  Not doing the  health check ups.  They lecture people about their obesity and pre-diabetes.  They put them on their statins and record their height and weight.  Withhold antibiotics.  What do they do, again?  Immunise the babies.  Not so much.  What do they do again?  Get given information about the very very very very best local foraging spots.  While the people of the community line up to hand over their babies so they can do anything anything anything.  Who wouldnt' want to be a Medical Doctor in New Zealand?  Who wouldn't want to do psychiatry?  No speak English.  Go tell the Judge that if they didn't get teh forced confession they must be intermittently psychotic.  Not floridly so such as a jury would think so..  But just intermittently.  Every now and then.  Must be kept in an institution therefore.  ALl the ECT to the Wernicke and Broca's area to try and destroy language production and comprehension so they can never testify.  All of the nasal polyp surgery for them.  Just put a laser or suction device up the front nasal passage and swizzle stick it around for a while.  How many of those do you think you can do in one day?  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  Why are all these old men being reappointed into positions while there aren't jobs for anybody else.  Re re re re re re re advertise positions for foreign candidates.  Trick them into coming here until it's time to lock them up.  What education and training system?  Where are our highly educated graduates?  Where is the original research?  Where is the research?  Where is the research output of the Universit?  What University?  Can't wont' employ anybody doing any research.  The first year studnets output more research than the paid academics ffs.  The prevention and prohibition of research institution.  Have an extension.  We force you to take an extension.  We require you to re re r er er eenroll never stop paying the 'Univesrity'.  What University?  Nobody there.  Nothing home.  F*cking psychopaths.  F*ckign stupid f*cking psychopaths ruining everything for us all.  Hurry up and die, already ffs.  Get out of the f*cking way ffs.  Where are all the people you trained ffs?  What education and training programme?  IN spite of an despite you.  Get out of the f*cking way already.</p>

                            <p>Does Warwick want an apprentice?  Maybe he can look through all the photographs and pick himself out a 14 year old special student from Malaysia to be enrolled in Medicine (not her first choice).  Then she can do anything anything anything Warwick wants since Warwick is too f*cking stupid to calculate a GPA and offer enrolment on the basis of GPA.  Too f*cking stupid to graduate on the basis of who has done what they were supposed to do for graduation.  Let me guess...  The 65+++ year old guys promise to retire...  If only the 14 year old specical girls can be sent to them as apprentices.  Do anything anything anything they say for decades..  And decades...  And decades..  While they refuse to sign off on qualification completions.  Refuse to pay them wages so they can live independnetly. Real class act, NZ is.  Can't even won't even process an applciation on the basis of the published algorithm.  All these people who were required to have retired..  Decades ago.  Required to retire into the aged care institutions they are f*cking well responsible for having made.  F*cking and die, already, you f*cking stupid pricks.  Hurry up.</p>

                            <p>Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm not behaving very professionally, am I.  Well, I'm not on payroll to behave professionally.  THey are.  They are on payroll to  behave professionally.  ANd look at how they behave.  They are paid soooooooo muuuuuuuch to develop new skins on professionalism.  It's sooooo cutting edge research in suuuuuch a comeptitive environmetn you could  be forgiven for not understannding it for what it was.  Really world f*cking leading.  Yeah, right.</p>

                            <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/492057/more-funding-for-medical-school-places-welcomed  Hey, that's great Warwick.  Shame that Warwick is too f*cking stupid to calculate a GPA.  Shame that that's more places for the pedophile child molesters.  Love the decisions that were made from Dunedin to pick and choose to graduate and employ the 'Doctors' who would supply date rape drugs to teenagers at parties and then go on to murder one of them for complaining.  Great to see that there are going to be more and more government funded places for everything that it is that we value in Medicine.  I don't know why Warwick finds it sooooo hard to calculate a GPA.  It is just an average ffs.  It isn't advanced calculus..  It's really f*cking unfathmoable, actually. Ayesha says they must require something that is not their first choice.  Should they give euthanasia medicine to non-consenting because there is no other alternative, then?  Is that what makes a most excellent Doctor Warwick?  What was it that you valued?  Clearly it wasn't mathematical aptitude (can't even won't even calculate a GPA).  What was it that you valued?  It wasn't the reading skills, clearly.  It wasn't the 'repeat after me' to be found in examinations of what best practice etc was.  What was it that you valued, again?  What values do you have, again?  ESL no speak English.  No medical records.  No informed consent.  NO presription medicines.  No best practice.  No fit for purpose buildings.  F*cking psychopaths.  Pay and pay and pay and pay money to the 'Univesrity' you say...  TO keep studnets enrolled in courses they never applied to...  To not graduate them once they've done their time.  To not employ them, now.  Keep on advertising the readvertising of the readvertisement of the anybody anybody anybody to keep the death camps the way the marketing manager of the adminsitration says they must be kept.  Because nobody had a better idea.  No better ideas.  Everything it is that we value.  There really isn't anything here.  Not even trying, hey.  It isn't so much a problem the current stat of it.  The problem is the f*cking ideology of it all. The sheer and utter f*cking genious that is the most motivational and inspirational can't even won't even calcualte a f*cking GPA.  When do you die Warwick?  What's the f*cking plan, hey?  You are another Injustice Toogood that was hauled out of retirement only recently.  correct?  HOw old are you?  MOre than 65?  MOre than 75?  After how many  years of your f*cking crimes... F*cking die already, mate.  ALl the very veyr best of the aged care just fo ryou.  The only ones you would sign off on you f*cking psychopath.</p>

                            <p>Well, hey.  The great injustice Toogood can't even comprehend that the zero fees scam was for first year undergrads (not for grads enrolled in grad qualifictions).  Cant' parse the education and dtraining act.  Real quality hire that one.  Can't even parse the f*cking laws.  Probably never opened a law book.  A what, now?  </p>

                            <p>
                            There is a series of books 'First Aid for the USMLE'.  By 'First Aid' it means a go-to resource.  Your first place to look for help.  The USMLE is the United States Medical Lisencing Examination.  There are different Steps (stages) to becoming a Medical Doctor in the US.  The first step for lisencing is a theory-based test of subject knowledge.  The basic sciences that are required for Medicine.  Bio-chemistry.  Genetics.  Some Statistics and Law and PUblic Health.  Immunology.  Physiology.  Anatomy.  The theory.  So that you have a knowledge base from which to identify what kinds or sorts of things might be going medically wrong.  There are case studies, also.  So a patient presents with certain symptoms.  What kinds of differentials.  It might be a or b or c or d.  What tests can you do to narrow it down?  What treatments are there?  Pharmacology.  COntraindications.  This one or that one.  How do you decide.  Etc.  Medical Books.  WIth the medical knowledge.  Do you want to study Medicine.  Really?  Learning that kind of information to  help patients.  Really?  You like to spend time reading do you?  Researching.  To figure out what is going wrong and work out ways to help?  No?  You just like to tell everyone that you are a doctor.  Have the power to decide who gets the death jabs and who will be spared.  Have the people do anything anything anything you say.  What Medical School?  Can't even won't even process applications to enrol.  NOt even trying to be fair at all.  Won't do it.  Nothing tehre.  Nobody home.  I know not everything is learned from books.  But take a look at ahte ones they picked for academic  medicine.  Fail the basic reading comprehension check.  What Medical school?  THere isnt' anything there.
                            </p>

                            <p>I guess the ideal is that it is better that the 'Psychiatrists' no speak English.  Or at least claim not to.  That way they can't read the patients file notes or contribut to the writing of them.  THey will  need to just follow orders of the managing administrator who tells them what is to happen with this, that, or the other one.  What 'medical procedure' is going to  be performed, maybe by order of the Judiciary.  Order any labotomies to be done lately, Injustice Toogood?  How about removal of 'nasal polyps', I think they like to call them.  ECT?  Bi-lateral?  Want to make sure you go after the language production areas so that they can't testify against you or other members of the Judicaiary or anybody else.  Anyone in your old boys network.  What happened to Uffindell?  He would have got some prime position working with children now, right?  SInce he was picked out to be a prime bully and groomed into position by his teachers,  he'd make a 'must  have' for teaching.  Right?  When he applies for any position the police will be able to attest to him keeping his mouth shut about the crimes of others in exchange for a little something something of his own.  Correct?  Just so we can understand why it is that there isn't anything allowed to be here.  Because people just loved their daughters so much they wanted to make better world for htem.  Of course.  ANd they thoght what they'd most love is to be prime bully of a detention camp of their very very own.  To serve their husband, I guess.  So they don't have to fill that function anymore.  Oh, NZ is all about the animal rights.  I mean the people rights.  Yeah, right.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  No people.  Nobody wants to live amongst equals.  Everybody is just vying for the position of apical predator.  No peoplel.  Hey.  No people at all.</p>

                            <p>They were doing DBT.  IT was a good initiative.  Psychology.  But not only.  They had a couple people from Nursing etc.  THey did not have a psychiatrist on board.  Not a single one.  The counselling was a good initiative.  But the government would't fund counsellors.  Not unless they are abusive covering up the govenrments crimes.  I guess.  That was likely it.  They wanted lists of people who claimed to have been abused by partiuclar people so they could silence them, I suppose.  I suppose there was that.  Like they don't want the DNA testing (paternity) because it turns out that certain psychopaths are more individuals Daddy's than they are supposed to be (e.g., fertility treatmentsn not being done with any integrity at all).  They can track the flow of STD's and syphilis etc with testing.  So the evidence of who is sexualy molesting the kids (only one on payroll of course) is something that is available. IN some sense of available.  But of course we would only payroll the known offenders to be punative punative punative.  Because there isn't any other job for NZers.  Right?  I mean, prostituion is legal.  It is required?  If it is legal then that means people can be forced to work that job?  Is that hte idea?  Simply don't process their application for anything else...  Punative punative punative punative punative.  </p>

                            <p>Their point is...  Australia wants nuclear submarines -- but it doesn't really seem to have any job offerings, even, in the way of regular submarines.  New Zealand wants rocket scientists -- but it doesn't really seem to have any job offerings, even, in the way of aircraft.  Waikto wants a Medical School -- but it doesn't have a nursing department.  That seems to be the idea.  I mean to say, recently there are (made-up and not actually hiring?) postings about them wanting people to work with regular submarines, aircraft, and a position for a research nurse to be enrolled in a masters or doctoral qualification (to pay and pay and pay the 'university') while being responsible for undergrad teaching.  Yeah, right.  Their point is 'how plausible is it to develop a Medical School when we don't even have nursing'.  Well, WINTEC has nursing ffs.  They've had it for years and years and years and years and years.  And since it has nothing to do with the Univesrity maybe the programme is decent.  I don't know.  How many of their studnets do they put to work in the name of internships and not sign off on completion so as to get more and more and more money for keeping the hostages re re re re re re re enrolled?  I suspect that's a Univesrity of Waikato initiative.  That's what you get for hiring the psychopathic management people who think they are soooooooo cleeeeeever they will grow the research school at all costs!  By completly undermining and stabotaging it.  THey don't need grad research studnets when they can have prisoners hostages slaves.  Well record as being enrolled all the people you want.  The 'judge' pulled out of retirement can't see a problem with you recording people as being enrolled in qualifications they never even applied to!  HOlding graduate research studnets indefeinately under the zero fees scheme ffs.  What Univesriety?  ffs.  </p>

                            <p>You do have psychology departments and education departments.  The psychology people focus on cognitive behavior therapy.  Why?  Because it is punative punative punative punative punative which fits really really well with the general ideology.  They have the psychology testing library that they use to pick out only the most abusive and so on of the applicants to work in the prisons.  That's a Waikato initiative.  The use to which they put the psychology personalitly etc screening tests.  Right?  How much do you pay for access to the testing library?  Corruption.  That was what I saw when I was there, anyway.  How much people would pay for access to the answers for the psyschological tests.  To work with the department of corrections etc.  That's psychology.  Hey lets hire some psychologists to go out to the prisons and record how the mental state of the prisoners kept unlawfullly drugged and in conditions of torure is going.  We know best how kiwi are to be kept.  They like to be kept that way. > How mjuch do you have to beat them until they voluntariliy choose to remain in indefinite seclusion.  Why think the prisoners are voluntariliy takign the drugs they test positive for on the drug tests.  How plausible is that really?  They are being abused and so on in state care.  We will have things no other way.  Punative puniative punative punative punative.  Cognitive behavior therapy.  Punative.  Punative.  Punative.  That's the state of psychology.  Who or what do you need within psychology to develop things out?  SOme stuff was starting to...  DBT.  But you can't do a lot when the psychiatry inpatient and the psychiatry people are drugging people poorly and so on.  What the hell...</p>

                            <p>Masters of councelling seemed quite good. What happened to them?  The graduates of that progarmme?  They made it be about sexual abuse, I thought.  A few special snowflakes were approved (only) to speak with people who said they had been sexually abused.  ACC funding for treatment, you see.  So people had to say they had been sexually abused to get treatmetn with one of the people they authorised to see them.  That was the thing of it.  So then the treatment was focused on them being a victim.  Of course.  Punative punative punative?  I don't know.  I didn't claim ACC for having been sexually absued and I never had therapy with a counsellor who was ACC apporoved for that purpose.  So I don't know the state or quality of things there...  But my issue is the defining of the scope of treatment as being focused on that particularly...  Why it has to be about victimhoood?  Disempowering.  I don't know.  Maybe it is different now?  Because there was a humanistic element.  Narrative element.  From within counselling from within education.  But again what you can do is limited with the incarcerations and the involuntary treatments and the druggings.  </p>

                            <p>Whatever.  It doesn't really matter.  The only thing that actually matters is that the people who think they are so so so so so f*cking clever they get to make all the decisions.  They know what is best.  ANd they have chosen the path whereby we hire no speak English people from overseas to punatively  manage the punative insittutions.  So they can testify to the Judge that people who don't want treatment are to be kept imprisoned and given psychiatric treatments (ECT, electrical stimulatiosm to their genitals, lobotomies, removal of nasal polyps, LSD prescriptions now, prescriptiosn of massive doses of old gen antipsychotics known to induce parkinsonian symptoms)...  Only treat the involuntary. Force the people who don't want treatment to be locked up and force medicated.  No treatment for people asking for a little help.  Punative only.  Punative punative punative.  It's soooooo competitive!  It's sooooooo competitive!  ANd these are the losers.  The vulnerable targets.  Some no speak English winner is goign to get to be deployed into position to get to abuse them, for a while, and then be off on their way.  Again and again and again.  The leaders of this region simply will not allow (surely will notm invest in) things being any other way.  No no no no no.  Not on their watch.  They will need to f*ckign die before they will allow things to be any other way. Good choosing!  Great decisions!!!  Well done!!!</p>

                            <p>Only treat the involuntary while they are screaming at you to stop.  Thats a 'hospital'.  Brought to you by the only graduates they will acknowledge of the 'University'.  Ffs.  Garbage dump of a waste f*cking land.  Nobody else need apply.</p>

                            <p>Shane Reti was good choosing, wasn't he.  Really lead the Whangarei hospital to develop.  What's that, he doesn't even work with patients, at all?  He sees patients 1-3 weeks every year to meet the bare minimum registration requirements.  How many patients has Ashley Bloomfield seen lately?  He seems to speak English, at least.  Oh, he's not registered.  How about Ayesha?  What about the other Waikato guy?  The one running for politics.  What's that?  We don't have doctors.  We pick politicians to enrol in Medicine and when it's time to graduate them for all the learnings of everything they learned in their despite us and certainly not because of us time at 'Univesrity'...  What a f*cking scummy scam.  Well, just record ever increasing levesl of debt against peoples name only for their 'con-munications' degree, then.  Where is the research output of the University?  List the people on payroll to do research.  How many paid to do research?  Then divide up their research output and see how many words nets them what pay every year.  How much do you pay them per word of research output.  What is the entire wordcount of the research output of the English Department, for example.  And how much do you pay the people to do research output.  HOw much do you pay them per word?  WHere is the research output?  What Univesrity?  F*cking hell.  Nobody home...</p>

                            <p>I mean, the thing is...  Who does Waikato hire for Psychiatry?  Foreigners, for the most part.  ESL speakers of Engish who don't have particularly understandable accents or ability to follow along what people are mumbling with their Kiwi accents at the very very best of times.  These are the people we hire to work Psychiatry.  There have been at least 2 cases reported in the Waikato Times over the years of people being FRAUDS or HOAXES.  On Psychiatry payroll when one of them never went to Medical School at all (learned enough to pass themselves off as in virtue of having been a former patient overseas in Russia, or somewhere) and the other one literally stole the credentials of a different person who had practiced for a time in the US.  He, himself, wasn't a psychitrist.  Of course it's possible that things are sooooo corrupt, in NZ, that when it comes time to actually pay them...  Actually hand over the payroll, they throw them in prison or have them voluntarily chose to run away else threaten to imprison them for some made up reason. It is possible that that is what is going on.  But it is also possible that we intentionally choose to preferentially employ frauds.  Hoaxes.  People who no speak English.  People thrown off the register for malpractice and abuse and the like, overseas.  Why?  Why?  Why?  It isn't that there aren't people from NZ who want to do it, who are capable of f*cking well doing it.  But no no no no no no no they aren't allowed.  We will hire frauds and hoaxes from overseas.  No speak English Psychiatrists.  Nobody from here is allowed to do it.  Why?  Punative.  Punative.  Punative.  Punative.  Punative.  Professor Glue and his f*cking Glue Factory is the only game in town.  THe only ideology their f*cking stupid brains could apprehend, one can only suppose.</p>

                            <p>I have spent time in Psychiatric hospitals over the years.  Many people have.  Many good people have.  I actually remember the part of Patch Adams where the guy was like 'how many fingers am I holding up' and it's worse than that.  No speak English.  There are some good people working within the health system.  But for the most part nobody is allowed to help anybody.  Why?  Because it's a real magnet for the psyschopaths and abusers.  People are drawn like flies to children adn vulnerable targets.  And I guess I didn't realise the extent of the government wanting to cover up the crimes.  Not interested in trying to do better, a lot of the time.</p>

                            <p>Hire known offenders only because they wont speak out about others crimes.  Criminal psychopaths.  Only teh criminal psychopaths need apply, then.  ANd anybody who speaks out about this situation can be thrown in 'state care' to be abused by the only people they would payroll to 'help' them.  What hospital?  What university?  There isn't anything here.  Punative punative punative.  Where is the research output of the research university?  They refuse to acknowledge my research output.  Was that because they had sooooo muuuuuuch research output that they could afford to be picky and choosy? What research output?  Where is your research output?  What univesrity?  F*cking hell.  Mate.  Refuse to accept my researach output.  There will be no research output at all!  ONly over their dead f*cking bodies, I swear.  Punative punative punative punative punative.  They will have things no other way.</p>

                            <p>Now they seem pretty focused on doing everything they can to grow the size of those kept punative punative punative punatively in state care.  They know full well that by not paying teachers and deploying punative and abusive people to teach the kids to be punative and abusive to each other they can maximise the return on their investment.  Their investment being to grow a population of gamma babies, one can only suppose.  I'm soooo glad I'm a gamma baby I don't have to be paid half as much as a graduate from Harvard who gets to come here and scummy scam and scheme about how to feel clever because I'm not any good.  Socially engineered to be a garbage dump of a wasteland by design.  New Zealanders don't have the right to not be subject to medical experimentation.  Didn't you know?  All the studies they think wouldnt' get past ethics boards in the US (and that really isn't saying a lot).  The only people they would employ to roll out experiments in NZ.  Only people on research payroll one can only suppose.  How can things be more punative and more abusive?  How?  HOw?  HOw?  Only research game in town one can only suppose...  Only studies they will fund.  We want to do generations of observational studies on how abusive the peple on government payroll are because we just like to observe that kind of sort of a thing.  It's the kiwi way.  Only way kiwi will be kept.  We will have things no other way.  Punative punative punative.  </p>

                            <p>Waikato didn't want a Medical School at all.  What they wanted was people to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay to enrol with the Univesrity.  Then they would throw them into the hospitals to pass themselves off as professionals for a while -- only insofar as they were paying the University for enrolment.  WOrk the job for free (actually while accumulating levels of debt for University enrolment).  There isn't anything there.  Not even tryign to be.  THey are advertising now for someone to go work for the 'University' in the capacity of 'nurse'.  To teach the PhD and Masters nursing studnets.  While  being kept detained by the University enrolled in the PhD or Masters programme, of course.  Just straggle yourselves up and,  hey, try not to get imprisoned when it's time for them to pay you.  Nothing there.  Not even trying to be.</p>

                            <p>Let's think about it, for 5 minutes.  1 student is going to work a 1 EFT teaching job.  Is that right?  What is a full-time teaching workload?  Is it 4 classes per semester for a total of 8 classes per academic year?  Is it 2 summer school classes in addition?  Or is that 2 full-time teaching workloads?  Is it 3 classes in one semester and then 4 classes in another semester for a total of 7 classes in one year?  That sounds about right..  I meam to say, students enrolled in 7 classes would be doing 1 EFT 120 points or one full time acaemic year.  Oh, but wait a minute...  Universities are required to be involved in research.  They are required to hire people who are actively involved in research.  But doing 1 EFT of work in the academic year leaves no time for any research.  So that can't be a full-time teachign workload for a Univesrity academic, then.  They would  need to have some time set aside for research.  In fact, their PRIMARY FUNCTION is supposed to be research.  So I guess that means they need to have not more than 0.5 EFT or FTE of research so that they can do at least 0.5 FTE or EFT of research, every year.  So, then. Half of 7 is a bit trickier..  I guess they will need to part-teach courses...  I bet the Univesrity hires really intelligent and good business people to make sure that their employees are properly cared for.  Not being required to do more than 0.5 FTE or EFT of teaching so that they can have research output. What kind of research output would we be looking at then?  I guess 50,000 words per year is reasonable.  Up to about that.  Why?  Because that's a 1 year masters.  A 3 year PhD (with up to 1 year of external examiantion with 2 x 3 months and an oral defence that needs to be scheduled and changes made after examiners reports received)..  100,000 words of research for a doctoral thesis with a minimum enrolment term of 3 years.  That's 50,000 words per year.  Then it goes out to teh external examiners ffs.  It isn't exactly rocket science, as they say.  What University???</p>

                            <p>Oh, but I bet the nurse not only has to do .5 FTE of teachign and .5 FTE of research, they are also supposed to actually work as a nurse.  Right?  No FTS left.  Nothing.   But then where is the time to have coffee with the Dean to yakkity yak yak yak about that?  When it sthe time to play b*tch to the Univesrity administration??</p>

                            <p>They will not hire people to work the job.  They won't do it.  They simply will not pay people to work the actual f*cking job.  That is why they say 'it takes 3 doctors for a functioning specialist unit'.  Because it is the equivalent of 3 FTE.  (1)  Research.  (2)  Teaching.  (3)  Clinical practice.  So 1/3rd of the time is spent on each of those activities.  Need 3 people for there to be 1 FTE clinial position filled etc.  It isn't advanced calculus ffs.  It's really not that f*cking hard.  WILL NOT DO IT.  WILL NOT DO IT.  There's nothing there.  PUnative punative punative punative punative.  Punative.  The only people on payroll to 'help' the studnets understand the degree requirements are people who punative punative punative punative punative.  The 'studnets' are required to  be held under zero fee scheame.  Scam.  Hoax of a f*cking scummy scam.  Says Justice Toogood.  Good choosing. It's just great that he gets picked out to do a 2 year Masters was it?  Certificate in Law from Yale.  Good choosing NZ.  He's got that amazing reading cmoprehension that you'd expect of a Judge.  Guess he's great at ordering punative punative punative punative punative to be involuntariliy detained in conditions of punative torture only.  Don't even need to have a trial.  Either you sign the confession voluntarily else to be detained in the name of psychiatry.  Remove your nasal polyps, forced participation in fight club (that was uploaded with cellphones which is why the prisoners don't get cellphones to document the crimes of abuses in state care).  Punative punative punative.  F*cking psychopaths.  Only ones they'd payroll.</p>

                            <p>Will not graduate their students.  Hey, can't even process an application to enrol.  What a f*ckign farce of a hoax of a scummy scummy scam.  Where is your research output 'University'???  Where is it?  What was the research output of your academics last year?  ffs.  What a f*cking joke.  </p>

                            <p>I didn't think University of Waikato did nursing, actually.  THat was WINTEC.  Polytech.  Waikato doesn't offer first year physiology.  Doesn't offer human biology.  Can't get a thesis out to external examiners in a timely fashion...  Nobody there.  NOthing home.</p>

                            <p>Apparently there is a new Dean of the School of Research.  What did they do with Kay Weaver, then?  What 'Univesrity' did they ship her off to ruin next?  Great business model you have there, Kay.  Go try that in the private sector?  No?  Move from England (Nottingham) to NZ (nobody from NZ could work tht job) to undermine and stabotage the Univesrity.  The prevention and prohibition of research project that you have there.  To completely and utterly undermine the research school by refusing to get the students work out for external examination.  What research?  Line up all the thesis (with teh enrolment dates) that was the studnet research output on your watch.  F*cking psychopath.</p>

                            <p>The new dean wants the research studnets to go meet with and have coffee.  Is that where they explain carefully about how many decades of re re re re re re re enrolment a 120 point 1 EFT 34 weeks including the external examination period reserch masters will take?  What University?  NOt even trying to pretend to be.  Garbage f*cking dump of a wasteland.   Nobody from NZ is allowed to work that job.  No speak English.  Struck off for being a psychopath.  Only need apply.  F*cking garbage dummp of a wasteland by design.  What Univesrity?  F*cking psychopaths.  Medical experimentation grounds, I would suppose.  Waikato HOspital have any accreditation left to do any actual procedures?  I though tthey were progressively losing all of the accreditations.  That was the point, right?  Just f*cking burn the whole thing down to the ground.  Unless the graduates of Harvard (only they ones they don't want around) want to come to NZ and do all their knock out baby gene studies trying to breed Gamma babies so they can feel better about themselves because yes.  They actually are that retarded.</p>

                            <p>________________</p>

Is that the sort of arrangement that had Dr Leeks redeployed into position so he could have second and third and fourth chances of re-offending?  The financial package offered to offenders to give them many many more chances.  The most valued employees ever.  Only ones on payroll.  I guess there is the issue of 'what surgeons'?  I mean, they aren't getting people on the training positions, they aren't signing off on completion of training.  And, of course, they aren't training them at all.  Just get in there and have a go.  We want the patients to die on day 31 post surgery becuase we keep stats of post-surgery until day 30.  But I don't suppose we keep any stats at all of the f*ck ups and faiures of those who will get in there and have a go without any training being provided at all.  I mean, who wouldn't want to have a go at inserting IUD's to non-consenting patients?  Providing cervical examinations.  WHen they can't even won't even keep accurate medical records.  Only treat the non-voluntary involuntary non-consenting.  What health system?  What education system?  Prison camp detention camp.  The only leaders overseas will acknowledge for this region.  Not developed nations at all.  Will not do it.  Waiting for however many people to f*cking die so that the rest of us can have a life, for a change.  Nasty nasty slavers. </p>

                            <p>https://www.seek.co.nz/job/68075344?type=standout#sol=6341347ec7cf9d518ce77b722fd1a54273e9a629  Wow, that sounds like a terrific idea.  We can send out Education Graduates (insoar as there are any) off to foreign lands as 'volunteers'.  Unpaid worker-slaves.  That's a 'genuine employment opportunity', apparently.  To do the job without pay.  Who did they pay to do their advertising and marketing and con-munications to have people sign up for doing the job without pay.  Sounds like an 'employment opportunity' brought to you by the New Zealand Government who thought that it was more important to staff the country with managing advertising con-munications specialists.  Spin-doctors working to undermine and stabotage and disempower as many individuals as possible.  I'm sure what developing nations really need are unpaid worker slaves from New Zealand.  Given how our education system is really flourishing and thriving and all. What's that?  We don't know how lucky we are!  Indeed.  If only we knew how f*cking unlucky we f*cking well are.  To live in this sh*t hole country who doesn't even believe in people.  Divisive and undermining.  Punative only.  There is no alternative.  Nasty nasty nasty nation of slavers.</p>

                            <p>The United States Medical Lisencing people won't allow anybody to sit their examination (so you can register to practice Medicine in the US) unless they graduated from a Medical School that is from their approved list, within the last 5 years.  I informed them that the 'Universities' of Auckland and Otago (the only 2 'Universities') of New Zealand are not properly processing applications to enrol and are not properly processing progressions through training and completions of training.  I asked if I could independently study the course material (you can pay World Question Bank and so on for access to curriculum contents and purchase 'First Aid for the USMLE' study books for curriculum contents) and then sit the examinations - and they said 'no'.  I mean to say, they don't care about demonstrated competence.  Assuming their examinations are designed as fair tests of competence, they aren't interested in competence.  The whole thing is just a f*cking scam.  They don't care about competence regarding the course materials and course work.  They don't care about your actual performance doing physical examinations etc.  The whole thing is just a f*cking farce of a hoax of a scummy scummy scam.  Off to the death camps with and for you now, you hear?  It's sooooooooooooooo competitive.  Sooooooooooooooo cmopetitive.  There is actually nothing there.  That was around 2019.  Prior to Covid.  I don't know how many Medical Graduates were lost because they got Covid and died in the USA.  NZ didn't feel the need to claim that Covid killed anybody.  We just kept on with our usual 'just up and died for no good reason like Mason Pendrous happens to the children all the time' and 'died in state care' and 'voluntarily suicided'.  Yeah, right.  Who is supplying NZ with euthanasia drugs?  Given that we cannot.  We will not.  Keep accurate health records.  All the pills and injections that are given in the 'hospitals' without having been prescribed by anybody at all.  There isn't anything there.</p>

                            <p>The only way you can get into a treatment programme is if you get a court order for one.  Go on then.  Go be a criminal.  Go offend.  Then we can write you up as a criminal.  Oh, but there aren't in-patient treatment programmes.  You need to be out of jail to have treatment.  Oh, but now you are out of jail and there isn't any treatment.  You would need a judge to court order treatment before you would get treatment.  Only treat the involuntary.  Punatively.  They must be punished.  What psychiatry?  Punative institution of abuse.  All these people presenting to judges asking to go on treatment programmes.  They say they want the court order to go on the treatment programme.  They wanted the treatmnet programme.  The treatment programme.  What do they have to do to get on the treatment programme?  What treatment programme?  What treatment?  There isn't anything there...  THey won't employ anybody to work that job.  Those jobs.  Punative only.  Punative institutions of abuse only.  Won't let the UN inspectors in.  The prisons...  How many people kept in the prisons longer than the maximum sentance for the crimes they've been charged with.  What judiciary?  There isn't anything here...  What judiciary?  What a f*cking joke.  Just won't do it.  Wah wah wah wah wah we don't have enough lawyers.  Wah wah wah wah wah we won't pay them.  Wah wah wah re re re re re re enrol them.  We'll never graduate them.  Forget about learning anything in your 'education and training programme'.  Anything learned is IN SPITE OF AND DESPITE THEM.  It's sooooooo compeetitive!  Soooooo competitive!  Here is a great game.  Let's arbitrarily divide the class up.  Carve off a small group and tell them about how they are sooooo special they have been arbitrarily picked out chosen as leaders of the slave camp detention camp and if they don't do anything anything anything anything their psychopathic supereriors say when they say because they say (housesit for me, go camping) then they will throw them into the underclass of the enslaved detainees.  Nasty nasty slavers.  There isn't anything here.</p>

                            <p>There aren't any people, you see, because persons are equal in respects that matter. But they aren't wanting there to be people here there aren't any people.  Nasty nasty slavers.</p>

                            <p>I think I have come to understand what some psychiatrists have been saying, for quite some time.  Psychiatry is not a specialist field within Medicine insofar as there are such things as compulsory detention and forced drugging ('treatment').  Particularly when it focuses on massively over-prescribing old generation anti-psychotics for their 'chemical straitjacket' or sedation effects when they know full well the longer term side-effects of Parkinsonian-like symptoms.  There have been human rights proponents (who were themselves psychiatrists) who thought that psychiatry needed to get back with the programme of focusing on people who were actually asking for psychiatry to help them.  Rather than working with abusers, basically, to keep victims oppressed. Freud was a neurologist and regarded as one of the first psychiatrists.  Jung.  Various of the psychoanalytic and then psychodynamic schools were things that developed from within psychiatry.  The idea of talking cure was there from the ground up.  But New Zealand is prison camp detention camp land.  There isn't any Medicine, either.  I mean to say, the entire Medical 'Profession' in NZ...  Either there isn't one, else they aren't even pretending to be actually practicing medicine.  Only 'treat' the involuntary.  They won't let the UN inspectors have unrestricted access to our hospitals.  Punative conditions only.  Abusive conditions only.  Died in state care.  Wrongful death.  Sexual violation.   How many people involuntary detained in conditions of torture?  What hospital?  But the Universities can't process applications to enroll.  The Universities won't acknowledge progression through training.  Won't sign off on completion of training after the studnets have done their time as studnets.  Won't do it.  Not even trying to be Universities.  What Universities?  There's really nothing there.  NZ doesn't have psychiatry, but that isn't because there is anything specially different about psychiatry than there is from Medicine more generally.  NZ doesn't have Medicine.  Doesn't have Universities.  What Judges?  What Lawyers?  What Engineers?   I mean there simply isn't anything here at all...  Not even trying...</p>

                            <p>There was something I read about this problem in China of University Graduates finding themselves unemployed.  They were saying the problem was that they were not willing to work the jobs that there were.  Well, what jobs are there?  Pay people to cover up the crimes of the government and pay people to commit crimes on behalf of the government..  What jobs are there?  I don't know that governments pay people to commit crimes or if committing crimes is it's own reward.  Did the Nazi's pay the Nazi doctors?  The 'doctors'?  Did they pay the soldiers who marched people off to the death camps?  Or were they willing volunteers?  Did they simply 'just follow orders' because they were told that if they didn't march off xx amount in their quota for the week then they'd be next off to the death camp?  I mean, what kind of thing are we talking, here, when we say that the problem is that there aren't jobs for University graduates?  What sort of class sizes are we talking about when they say there are too many people trained in primary teaching and they won't employ any more primary teachers?  Are we talking 30 students per class?  How many university studnets for 1 researcher?  What are the class sizes expected to be so that we can cry cry cry cry cry about how people simply have to go off to the death camps because we can't always have what we want since some people actually want to be slavers or maybe they simply want to sing happy songs about how victorious they are while marching others off to the death camps.  I mean, what the hell...  </p>

                            <p>I mean, there is a pattern here.  They go 'if you study x there won't be a job for you.  There is a shortage of y.  Study y if you want a job'.  Then the people who study x don't get jobs (hey, there was never going to be a job for them).  The people who study y - not because they wanted to, but because they wanted a job..  THey get to be part of a wonderful cohort of people doing it only becuase they are focused on the job...  That way you can eliminate anybody who wanted to do it becuase they wanted to do it...  Only graduate those who were in it for the money.  Then simply not hire any of them.  Keep readertising the job.  Hey that's a good job.  HIre someone to advertise and readvertise and readversise.  Maybe interview.  Maybe do some interviews.  Hey, you could get them flying around the country for short-notice interviews like AUckland and Otago do for Medicine.  Get people paying and paying and paying to sit examinations where there is no right answer, everybody fails, everybody must pay and pay and pay again the following year for re re re re re examination.  I'm sorry, you passed the ethics test so we never will not pay you to work the death camps.  There isn't anything here...</p>

                            <p>And it isn't about the money.  Ffs.  Except insofar as they make it be about the money by using money as a tool of abuse.  Which is the whole modus operandi of NZ.  Abuse in state care.  State 'care'.  Abuse.  Abuse.  Abuse.  Highest rates of child abuse.  We know how kiwi like to be handled.  How they must be handled.  Only way they are allowed to be handled.  ANything else would constitute abuse.  We know what is best for kiwi.  There really isn't any reasoning with the people who have the power, in NZ.  Not even trying to be humane at all.  There isn't anything here.</p>

                            <p>It would have f*cking well killed them to have enrolled me in Medicine and graduated me.  ALlowed me to work with patients.  It would have f*cking well killed them.  Well keep blackbirding, then, for 'no speak English' volunteers who will come  here and deliver euthanasia drugs when we lack the willingness and the ability to keep accurate health records.  Not even trying, hey.  There simply isn't anything here.  NZers lack access to basic medicines because we don't have any doctors.  THey won't pay anybody to work that job.  THey can't tell the difference between a doctor and a f*cking psychopath.  Build a monument to Dr Leeks!  Professor Glue's Glue Factory is the only game in town.  THey simply wouldn't look at enrolling, progressing through training, signing off on completion of training, anybody else.  Nobody else would be employed.  You gotta keep the people abused in state care.  Punative.  Punative.  Punative.  Punative and abusive only.  We know how kiwi must be kept (and any foreigners we can blackbird into coming here).  There is no alternative.  There's abosolutely f*cking nothing here.  Quite by design.  Taken over by f*cking psychopaths, indeed.</p>

                            <p>Justice Toogood doesn't see anything wrong with Univesrity of Waikato recording that studnets have been enrolled in programmes of study that the studnet never applied to be enrolled in.  THey are not keeping accurate enrolment records at all.  They are telling lies about the studnet numbers.  Forcing studnets to be re re re re re re re re re re re enrolled and not getting graduate research (particularly) out to external examiners for external examination.  Who are the people they choose to hire to keep studnet slaves?   Mostly foreigners.  We are supposed to believe that NZers leave NZ and get to keep slave camps of their own overseas but I don't think that that is true, particularly.  They don't even pretend to hire researchers to work at the University.  What research output?  HOw many researchers do you have for all the studnet enrolments you claim?  HOw many managing marketing con-munications advertising...  Pay people to run writing workshops etc and treat the graduate researchers like they are too f*cking lazy to write 50,000 words of research in one year when they have been f*cking well doing it for how many years as undergraduates?  Only hire those too f*cking stupid or lazy to output to ensure that nobody is allowed to output.  Crabs in a bucket.  Tall poppy syndrome.  There isn't anything there.  Not even trying to be a fucntioning University.   </p>

                            <p>And let that take over Australia, then.  The Fabulous Kim Sterelny can be shipped back to Australia from NZ (after being shipped from Australia to NZ in the first place because nobody was going to be employed from NZ to work that job) and he can see how many NZers he can destroy from Canberra.  How many years is Carl Brusse supposed to hand work over to Sterelny to be re re re re re re re enrolled?  How many decades?  While Kim pretends to be too f*cking stupid to get the work out to external examiners.  Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year for him to go on about how he's such a f*cking psychopath psychopaths have taken over everything.  You have to go camping it's important for your career.  You have to housesit his house.  You have to go listen to other people give talks and not give talks of your own.  F*cking psychopath.  And he won't actually talk about anything he supposedly or allegely wrote.  Likely because he wasn't the author of it in the first place.  ANd it's just a f*cking hoax.  So 'people' from teh Northern Hemisphere can blackbird for slaves, then.  HOw many studnets go to North Carolina for 1 year and hand over work..  Is that the idea?  Hand over course-work so that they can reattribute authorship to their own stupid children so their stupid children can be appointed into positions as University acadaemics when they have no abiltiy or probably inclination even to do any research of their own.</p>

                            <p>There doesn't seem to be any f*cking shortage of people who will take money to keep slaves.  The Universities, sorry 'Universities' want to hire 1 supposed researcher for 1,000 + students and then have that researcher simply appropriate the output of the studnet slaves for their own.  So they arent hiring researchers at all.  Slavers.  Who wants to be a slaver?  To be paid hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to ensure the prevention and prohibition of University.  No such thing.  Not on your watch.  There's nothing there, at all.  Nobody with the willingness and ability to do research was graduated.  If they complain better throw them in the psych ward and involuntariliy drug them for their anxiety LSD delusion must be the schizophrenia.  The problem ist hat htey desire to escape their slaver.  That's a mental disease didn't you know.  Political dissent.  What psychiatry?  What medicine?  What hospitals?  What Universities?  THere isn't anything there.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  Taken over by f*cking psychopaths.</p>

                            <p>Amnesty Internatnional Used to have an office physically at the top of Queen St.  Corner of Queen St and Karangahape road.  I went in to speak to them about the prison camp detention camps passing themselves off as 'Universities' and they said that there wasn't any slavery in NZ so far as they could see.  That was before it was publicised about the seasonal workers not being paid, and so on.  Construction workers being deported without being given their salaries.  But after we heard about international students being detained in psychiatric 'care' before being deported without their qualifications.  Anyway, at the time I went in to see them I asked them what they did, exactly, since they weren't registering or lodging or processing complaints.  They said they wrote policy.  I asked to see the policy that they wrote, but they couldn't show me that.  So...  There never was anything there.  But now they aren't even pretending to be.</p>

                            <p>'The appropriate thing to do is to stand down'.  Otherwise we are entitled to bully and bully and bully and bully you so that you are forced to stand down for reasons of your 'mental health' because that's what having a mental condition is or means in the under-developed state of New Zealand.  There is no trial or inquiry.  There is no removal from office.  That could be done humanely.  Instead we will have a trial by public opinion (a mobbing) and feel entitled and justified into bullying the person to voluntarily choosing to walk away from however many hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and thousands and millions of taxpayers dollars they are being paid and paid and paid and paid and paid.</p>

                            <p>Are we more corrupt than South Africa?  Are we more corrupt than Fiji?  The Government doesn't seem willing or able to understand what 'State' means.  Ffs.  What people do you see?  Looking at the leadership...  I don't see any people.  I don't see any people at all. What people do you see?  We just pray every day that they might get sick and be forced to go away.  Please God.  What people do you see???</p>

                            <p>I remember my Mother saying that she quite liked Trump.  I was like, what?  Or, why?  And she said she watched season one of the apprentice and she liked the way he said 'you are fired'.  That there was a board room meeting and a discussion of what went wrong.  And the person who dropped the ball was identified and they were fired for reasons that were articulated.  And that doesn't mean that they couldn't or wouldn't thrive in a different kind of environment or with different people in their team, or whatever.  But the fact that it didn't go on and on and on and on and on and f*cking on.  Trying to get however many of the people to drop f*cking dead of f*cking boredom or dropping f*cking dead of being bullied and bullied and bullied and bullied in an endless pretence of a hoax of an 'inquiry into what went wrong'.  Ffs.  It's not that f*cking hard.  EVERY OTHER NATION SEEMS TO HAVE F*CKING WELL MANAGED IT.  Australia had an apology into the stolen generation but NZ won't apologise for sh*t because IT IS STILL AT IT AND IT WILL NOT STOP AND IT WON'T EVEN ADMIT THAT IT IS WRONG.  No f*cking people ffs.  What people do you see?  Torturing an innocent child for fun is morally wrong.  Also legally proibited.  Nooooooo Noooooooo Noooooo whatever could that meeeeeeeean.  F*cking retards in power in stupid f*cking land.  There aren't any people here.  The only leaders that international community will acknowedge for NZ.  Forced to get behind Australia.  F*cking how.  How much lower can we f*cking go?  Euthanasia drugs brought in and they can't even manage accurate health records.  Consent is about people 'voluntariliy choosing to stand down' after being bullied to death.  There is no justice here.  No health system.  No education.  There isn't anything here.  Garbage dump of a f*cking wasteland.  The f*cking leadership won't have it any other way.  The only leaders international con-munity will acknowledge for NZ.  Garbage f*cking dump of a wasteland.</p>

                            <p>Full time GPA of 8.6.  But that's meaningless  because they don't grade things properly.  They will actually record that studnets have failed (F).   Not because they didn't go to class.  Not because they didn't prepare for class.  Not because they didn't do the readings.  Not because they didn't listen attentively.  Not becauase they didn't learn the content.  Not because they didn't demonstrate understanding of the content.  Not because they didn't engage in or with the content.  But because none of those things are valued.  We don't care about any of that.  In fact, identify the people who engage with education and fail those ones.  Then give the highest grades to the ones who didn't go to class.  And or who didn't to the readings.  And or the ones who yakkity yak yakked their way through the lecture.  And or the ones who didn't hand in their essays on time.  And or the ones who handed in someone elses and passed it off as their own.  And or the ones who paid the administration to record a higher grade.  And or the ones who bullied however many other studnets into leaving altogether because it's been taken over by psychopaths.  </p>

                            <p>For how many years are you supposed to pay the university pay the university pay the university pay the university -- before they are supposed to pay you?  If you are still at the university after that time then they pay you they pay you they pay you they pay you.  They pay you they pay you.  They pay you.  They pay.</p>

                            <p>There isn't anything there, you see.  It's garbage.  A f*cking hoax of a f*cking scam.  They won't pay people to research and teach.  They pay people to keep hostages endentured servants slaves.  They won't get the work out to external examiners and allow the students to complete the qualifications in a timely basis.  They won't pay the workers.  Theres nothing actually there.</p>

                            <p>What education and training system?</p>

                            <p>What judiciary?  I guess that's because there aren't any law graduates.  What health system?  No doctors or nurses.  Theres nothing there.  Garbage dump of a wasteland.  Not even trying to be fair at all.</p>

                            <p>What's that?  The Government is just a script-bot.  Designed to keep Australasia socially engineered as a prison camp detention camp slave camp.  That's how the administration governs still.  Either they choose to or it's just the output of script-bots.  Can't lay a complaint with the human rights people, for example.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  'There could be no application received that would attest to...'  Just put that down as the automated response to every complaint you receive.  'There could be no evidence recieved or accepted such that' for lowest perceived corruption ever.  Just script bot that every time.  Or only pay people to output indistginushable from a computer programme.  Script bot responses.  For the script bot 'judges' who can't see anything wrong.  No evidence could be submitted such that...  Theres  nobody home.  Nothing there at all.</p>

                            <p>Clearly the NZ government doesn't have any control of the con-munications.  They just read the script-bot.  The pre-approved script-bot questions to the pre-approved audience actors.  Mercenaries.  How much do they pay them?  Oh, they don't imprison them and feed them diseased rabbit organs that were fed to diseased rabbits to make more diseased rabbit organs to be fed to more diseased rabbits...  Who wouldn't want to work their way up the food chain and be responsible for feeding people to people to people to people.  It's all about the people, that's what script-bot Jacinda would say.  All about the people the people the people for some of the  highest suicide (also 'suicide') rates in the world.  Nobody would expect any different of the slave camp prison camp land of Australasia.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>Hi Kim Sterelny.  So great to see you arrive to start supervising me at the ANU 6 months after I arrived to start work on my thesis.  You can see the work I did in the first 6 months and over the first year.  What supervision meeetings were there?  Was a single meeting scheduled?  What feedback did you provide me on my written work over the first year?  Did you supply me with reading lists?  Instructions for things to be summarised or whatever?  What work did you ask to see?  How about over the second year?  That's documented here, too.  The work I did over the first two years of my doctoral candidature.  Where is there evidence of meetings about any of that?  Instructions for me?  Any feedback or comments at all?  WHY DO THEY PAY YOU?  Where is evidence of your supervision?</p>

                            <p>A PhD is supposed to be 3 years.  The examination process can take up to a year.  The external examiners checking it was the studnets own work.  Asking for more work.  More references.  Read this and add that.  Remove this and go do that.  Oral defence.  Another round of examination.  Did you send my work that I did over the first two years out for external examination?  When?  Did you tell me what I'd need to do before you would send it?  What the hell do they pay you for?  What evidence is there of you doing any supervision at all?</p>

                            <p>So then I go to the US for a year.  My work doesn't go out to externals -- you send me out to externals to do more work for them for 'non-credit'.  I'll give them written work for 'non-credit' will I?  What is the quality of that supposed to look like, then?  The 'work' that I hand over for non-credit?  What does that even mean?  Am I supposed to hand them written work for courses edited for non-credit?  </p>

                            <p>Then I go back to Australia and what supervision is there there now?  And I'm supposed to just keep handing them 'work' just keep handing them more and more and more and more while Kim Sterelny doesn't do anything at all when it comes to supervising me.  'We have been taken over  by psychopaths!' he declares periodically.  Indeed.  </p>

                            <p>What University?  There's nobody home.  Nothing there.</p>

                            <p>They won't get research out to external examiners.  I don't think they got any of the studnets work out for external examination.  I didn't see anybody have a scheduled oral defence or oral examination.  They just took the work of Australasians and handed it over to visiting academics from the Northern Hemisphere.  Mostly ones already on payroll.  And various people who visited the Australian National University to party party party.  Go to University to have morning tea, lunch, afternooon tea.  Drinks.  Dinner.  Go away on camping trips.  What University?  There's nothing there.  </p>

                            <p>I wrote to the administration of the University to let them know that this happened.  The Vice Chancellor, in the first instance.  I mean, my supervisor was supplied with various pieces of written work over the first three years of my enrolment (where it's supposed to be three years enrolment extendible to three and a half because of the time it takes to externally examine) -- and none of it was sent out for external examination.  I also supplied to them, at a point in time when I was currently recorded by them as being enrolled with them, a doctoral thesis more than 100,000 words in length.  They never got that out to externals.  My supervisor never gave me any comments on it at all.  My student records say that he told the administration that it was only 50,000 words long but it was more than 100,000 words and I included a word count for each section.  They aren't functioning as a University at all.  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camp.  That is how they choose to rule the Australian National University in Canberra.  Will not get studnets work out for external examination.  I don't think any of the 'students' recorded as being enrolled there had their work go out for external examination at all.  THey are not functioning as a University at all.  There isn't anything there.  Slave prison hostage detention camp.</p>

                            <p>The Administration today insisted that they would only hear a complaint if it was lodged as a complaint according to their formal complaints policy.  I said I'd prefer things to be sorted out informally.  But they wouldn't hear that they insisted on formal resolution.  Then they said that my compalint wasn't acknowledged by them as having been received at all.  I should revise and re submit my compaint.  Try again to formally submit a formal complaint.</p>

                            <p>The complaints policy and the people who receive the complaint (if any) may as well be script-bots.  Here is the script 'there could be no complaint received such that it could constitute a complaint'.  'Please try again to pass the bot-test'.  There isn't an Australian National University.  There was just a marketing advertising con-munications.  Come to Australia and spend your money party party party party.  See whose work you can take for yourself and keep as a trophy in your basement while they are bullied away.  Else pass it off as your own or hand it to your studnets for them to pass off as their own so the only people acknowledged as having done enough for doctoral qualification are plagarists all.  There isn't anything there.  They aren't processing progressions through training and completions of training.  They aren't even doing enrolments properly anymore.  Not even pretending to be Universities.  Nothing there.  Nobody home.</p>

                            <p>Australasia.  Socially engineered to be tower of babel-land.  I remember being in the tea-room when they announced in the news that the Australian Economy had overtaken the Canadian.  By which, I mean, the Australian Dollar was valued higher than the Canadian.  What choices did Australia choose to make, then, with all of this wealth that it had?  It wouldn't even get doctoral students work out for external examination to allow the hostages to be part of international community.  What international community, I guess there is that.  Trafficking human slaves.  Prisioners.  Detention camps.  There isn't really anything there, you see.  What research outputs?</p>

                            <p>I guess the idea was to get everybody's work to Sterelny.  Since he's a journal editor, apparently.  Then he can look into who submitted it to the journal and see who he can eliminate.  Him being appointed to the position in order to be a psychopath, and all.  Find out who isn't on payroll and elminate them.  Hold things up or tell them the work isn't good enough.  THen after 5 years it's regarded 'abandonware' -- right Sterelny?  To be re-attributed to a different author as you see fit.  Probably not you.  I think Penn is doing it now.  They like to think they have a research output.  SO they receive all the research inputs of people wanting publication and instead of helping them have a timely publication they steal the work and reattribute authorship of it</p>

                            <p>I sent two articles to the journal Philosophy Psychology and Psychiatry.  More than a decade ago.  I still have not received acknowledgement from them that they have received my submission.  I guess they can pass it to someone else.  A script-bot, even.  To copy paste it together with various other submissions from people not already on payroll.  So some people on payroll with a publication output have script-bot publications (so it's easy to fire them later) else no publications at all.  Because they aren't even trying to be an education and training system.  There isn't anything there, at all.  What's that Sterelny?  How is it possible that there be any products of civilication or socieity at all.  Indeed.  What products do you see?  Oh yeah.  The world is so hostile and it wasn't you it was your selfish selfish selfish genes.  Not even behaviorally modern.  No values.  Nothing of value.  A f*cking script bot could have taken the thesis and hit 'forward' to get it out for timely external examination ffs.  You had one job you had to do (get the work to externals).  What do they pay you for?  There isn't anything there. </p>

                            <p>What Education and Training System?  What health system?  What judiciary?  What law graduates?  What medical graduates?  What judges?  What doctors?  There isn't anything there.  They can't / won't process applications to enrol, they can't / won't keep accurate records of progression through training.  They can't / won't properly advertise jobs or employ people.  There's nothing there.  What products or outputs of civiliation?  What people?</p>

                            <p>What did Australia choose to do with the money they had?  When they were gloating to the world about the state of their economy?  They weren't crying about how f*cking poor they were.  Because it isn't about the money, hey.  Keeping people deprived is just a symptom of something different entirely.  Nasty nation of slavers.</p>

                            <p>The Australian Constitution declares that NZ is the second of the original states of the federation of Australia.  But the federal courts of Australia claim 'not our jurisdication' when it comes to upholding the law in NZ.  When it comes to upholding the law, in Australia, regarding people born in NZ.  It isn't because Australia doesn't have enough money.  It isn't about the money (they keep people poorly not because there isn't enough money but because they are nasty nasty slavers).  F*cking psychopaths.  More and more and more and more and more money for Sterelny so he can organise camping trips ffs.  Who the f*cking pays you to take the kiddies camping ffs.  Garbage dump of a waste-land by design.  They choose to pay and pay and pay and pay him to refuse to supervise grad studnets work.  That wouldn't be so bad if he would just get out of the f*cking way, then.  </p>

                            <p>Harlene Hayes sent medical studnets off to various internships overseas and they were signed off as having completed the internships.  They came back to Dunedin and they refused to graduate them.  THey were told they could pay the university for more enrolment and they could pay the government back for their internship year because they didn't accept the sign offs that they had.  Accused them of not having their bums physically on the seats in the hospital for long enough during their internship.  So they were to pay the University for more enrolment while doing internshiph year again in teh hospital but they would say they were junior doctors going into junior doctor positions but they would withhold graduation from them.  So did they get a registration number or not?  What registration number do they put on the prescription form when they drug the patients and say the drug was prescribed to them by the junior doctor they saw?  The one who pays and pays and pays the university and who doesn't have a registration number.  Who is passing themselves off as junior doctor.  Because the university withholds their qualification.</p>

                            <p>So they redeployed Harlene to Western Australia so she (as an American) can continue on her good works of undermining and stabotaging Australasia so that the children of the government officials will pay and pay and pay those Australian dollars to Harvard, one can only suppose.  Because there isn't an education and training system in Australasia.  And who wants to 'work' in teh death camps?</p>

                            <p>What are we supposed to think when they won't process applications to enrol.  Won't acknowledge progression through training.  Won't get graduate research work out for external examination.  Won't allow externals to sign off on qualification completions.  Won't allow them to sign off on internships.  Won't allow them to sign off on completion of doctoral qualifications.  There isn't an edcuation and training system here.  HOatages.  Slaves.  Prisoners.  Indentured servants.  They pay and pay and pay and pay and pay Dr Leeks.  Dr Green.  Harlene Hayes.  Kim Sterelny.  See what you have to do to be picked out to be part of the 'brain drain' to Australia?  All the brains, they reckon.  Psychopaths.  Most brainy.  All the brains for them.  Literally.  Kuru.  All the brains for them.  Literally gone mad with power.  MOre and more and more and more money for them.  It isn't about lack of money.  It's about everything else.  What education and training system?  What health system?  What judiciary?  THe judges refuse to uphold the law.  What judges?</p>

                            <p>Babbel. Babel.  Socially engineered to take the f*cking rocks from out of the ground and hand them over.  Prison.  Slave.  Detention camps.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  Theres nothing there.  Quite by design.</p>

                            <p>I mean, NZ doesn't even have the most basic access to medicines.  The standard medicines that there are in the US, UK, Ireleand, Scotland, Wales..  Provided to people of 'developed nations'.  There isn't anything here.  Lowest valued people in the world, isn't it?  Lacking the most basic of healthcare.  Lacking the most basic of education.  Babel only.  Positioning people only to stabotage and undermine.  Prevention and prohibition of develoment.  So overseas has some place convenient (to them) to send their psychopths to go be free to be slavers.  Can't have medications.  Don't have any doctors.  No registration numbers.  No prescriptions.  No accurate patient file notes.  No consent forms.  Supply euthanasia drugs only to a nation that can't keep won't keep the most basic health records.  Babel land.  Socially engineered to be.  Is the US and Harvard really that f*cking horrid that they need to be so very invested in the social engineering of a place to send their psychopaths.  Theres nothing here.  Change the laws by stealth (must have been an urgeny emergency that removed abortion from the crimes act with no public consultation) so the only grads Harvard would acknowledge from Medicine can go to the former-colonies and try and breed happier slaves.  What genes do you have to knock out so they are not verbal (cannot testify against you) and so they can be happy happy slaves?</p>

                            <p>Not even trying to be fair at all.  HOw many years research and then you give them the PhD.  ALl the people they gave PhD's to -- who didn't write a thesis at all.  Babel land.  Garbage dump.  There's nothing there.</p>

                            <p> https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2023/06/paddy-gower-has-issues-students-pull-out-their-phones-rather-than-help-11yo-beaten-up-at-napier-school.html  Did they film the attackers so that the attackers could not hide who they were?  What were the kids supposed to do?  Ask the attackers to 'stop that'.  But then the attackers would turn on them.  Right?  Why should we remove the personal security measure that people have in New Zealand?  We have some of the highest rates of child abuse and the like, in the world.  Why take away the childrens only defence?  Their ability to film their attackers.  Let's ban the security cameras from the streets (the police and judges won't remove the attackers from the streets) let's remove the security cameras from the 'hospitals' and the prisons and the schools and so on so that the abuses in state care can continue.  Document their crimes.  Document their crimes.  Document their crimes.  Do you think Dr Leeks would have been so valued and valuable as he was if his victims had have filmed him committing his crimes?  I guess they could have uploaded them to the dark web and sold the content...  Is that the idea?  That the kids are making snuff videos rather than documenting the crimes.  They are kids ffs.  It is up to the people with power to do something.  What did the school principle and board and so on do about the attackers?  What do the judges of NZ do about the attackers?  Upload the 'judges' to social media then.  When were the photos of them taken last?  Last century?  </p>

                            <p>https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2023/06/education-student-worries-about-impact-of-strikes-on-grades.html  Pfft.  Don't be silly little girl.  You don't 'just want to learn' at all. You are bored.  Wanting your phone to get your gambling fix because that's what the University Professor thinks that is.  Little kids like you don't want to learn.  Don't want to learn at all.  You go to school to eat your lunch with your friends and film the other kids being beaten up documenting how nobody will remove the abusers.  The victims are eliminated from the school as a lesson to everybody else.  Take out your phone little girl and huddle in with the herd.  Hey, maybe you will get picked to be a pilot in NZ.  It won't be because of grades.  It will be all very very personal and arbitrary.  Then they will send you in for a flight approach the wrong way -- because that's how we do in NZ and you can't make us do otherwise.  And you'll either be taken out yourself or you'll take someone else out.  That's how you know you made it in life!!!  There's nothing here.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  </p>

                            <p>https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2023/06/patients-advocates-want-government-to-overhaul-new-medicines-bill.html  We don't have publically funded access to the basic medicines that citizens of mainland Australia (and Tasmania), UK, USA do.  That makes us easy prey for the hucksters and scammers out there.  Hell, we are easy prey for the second-rate production of cheap generics.  We don't see any problem with the manufacturing process says the State of NZ (how many face masks did we return for not meeting spec?  How many vaccines?  how much food recall do we do)?  Most low valued population ever.  There for the taking.    </p>

                            <p> https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/death-of-a-schoolgirl-coroner-orders-review-after-teens-suicide/WGYMC6ZYVJEVHAZGLDFYWL3PDA/  I thought we weren't allowed to discuss methods of being suicided.  I guess that doesn't apply when it comes to blaming the victim for their personal personal personal it must be personal.  NZ has such high high high rates of suicide and 'suicide' and 'died in state care' and it's all very very very very personal the personal responsibility of the victim.  Their own fault.  Nobody else to blame.  Says the only coroner on payroll.  I suppose there is that. </p>

                            <p> https://www.newsroom.co.nz/news/two-churches-apply-for-judicial-review-of-royal-commission  And they would be right.  The UN instructed the NZ Government to undertake an investigation of abuses BY THE GOVERNMENT.  That is what IN STATE CARE means.  Nobody is denying that abuses took place in Church institutions and also in Private Schools.  That is not what the abuse in state care inquiry is about, however.  It is about ABUSE IN STATE CARE..  Not the private sector.  IN STATE CARE.  It isn't f*cking rocket science.  No speak English.  No, that isn't the problem.  The problem is something different entirely.  WILL NOT DO IT.  Is the problem that they are too f*cking stupid?  WHat is the f*cking problem? I genuinely do not understand.  It isn't that f*cking hard.  What is the f*cking problem? </p>
