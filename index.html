                                <a href="https://kellyroe.github.io/writing/realmecv.pdf">Chronological CV</a>
                                There is a link to my CV that I have presently under consideration for various things.
                             </p>

                             <p>I will try not to do  anything to break the links.</p>

                             <p>I am file re-formatting my work.  The links will be replaced.</p>

                             <p>I am also attempting to simplify my cv by turning individual pieces (some of which weren't previously available) into collections such as:</p>

                             <p><a href="./publish/2003-rep.pdf">Roe, (2003).  Collected Essays and Conference Proceedings for 2003.</a></p>

                             <p><a href="./publish/2006-rep.pdf">Roe, (2006).  Collected Essays and Conference Proceedings for 2006.</a></p>

                              <p><a href="./publish/2007-rep.pdf">Roe, (2007).  Collected Conference Proceedings for 2007.</a></p>

                             <p><a href="./publish/2008-rep.pdf">Roe, (2008).  Collected Essays in Cognitive Neuropsychology for 2008.</a></p>

                             <p>
                              <a href="./writing/ks.png">Here is an example of an email from Kim Sterelny.</a> 

                              I collated the 'few small chunks' as he refers to them, here:
                              </p> 

                                <p><a href="./publish/2013-rep.pdf">Roe, (2013).  A few small chunks for 2013.</a>
                                </p>

                                <p>It is basically a re-write of my thesis topic, especially for him.  You can see how I referenced him in the middle chunk, particularly.  That was his cue to send me emails telling me what I should take out and what I should put in.  I suppose that's how it is done?  Sterelny says, Sterelny, thinks, Sterelny believes.  Sterelny can tell me what my original contribution is allowed to be.  He can give it to me and I can copy-paste it into a thesis?  When?  For how many years am I to give him work, or how any years am I to do work for the University (present material at conferences etc) before they bundle it up and get it out to externals for external examination?  What University?</p>

                                <p>BEFORE I LEFT AUSTRALIA I sent him this: <a href="./writing\doctoral.pdf"> Over 100,000 words of doctoral thesis.</a> He gave me NO COMMENTS on it.  NO FEEDBACK.  AND HE WOULD NOT SEND IT OUT TO EXTERNALS.  Years later I get my student records from the ANU and there is  note from him asserting that I sent him 50,000 words (only) and it should be done in 3 months (therefore 3 months more money for the Philosophy Programme for keeping me re-enrolled so he gets more money for pretending to supervise me).  If he wanted to see 50,000 words from me (only) he should have asked for my words in 2006.  If he wanted 100,000 words (only) he should have asked for my words as at end of 2007.</p>

<p>I did not see any of the ANU students with reports from external examiners.  I did not see any ANU students give a public oral defence of their thesis in response to the reports from external examiners.  Public oral defences should have been publically advertised.  I simply don't believe that various people had public oral defences without my knowing about them.
</p>

<p>How are other students claiming to have PhD's from the ANU?

<p>
    Let me see their work over their comparable enrolment period.</p>

</p>  I don't understand.  </p>

<p>I guess the idea was that various people really really really really wanted to be philosophy academics.  Sooooo much more than me.  They just loved going along to `work' every day and eating their lunch with their friends.</p>

<p>How does Ashley Bloomfield get hired to be Professor when he never applied to be enrolled in PhD, never wrote a PhD, does not have any research output?  How does Jacinda Ardern get 3 fellowships at Harvard because she wants to write a book.  Why won't they hire someone who has already written a book ffs?  I guess she's a former politician so she can help them figure the logistics of breeding real knock-out babies in NZL to populate their under-ground bolt-holes, or similar.  Only the best and the brightest send their kids to Harvard to eat their lunch with Jacinda, obviously.  What Universities?  There's nothing there.</p>
