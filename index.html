                        <p>I don't know how much things were about 5G and face recognition with surgical masks on.  State your name and registration number for the camera.  State clearly what your role in the procedure is, today.  Who is responsible for itemising what is on the tray and who is responsible for initiating closing.  Who was responsible for the informed consent?  What procedure is being performed today?  It isn't rocket science, as they say.  Who is on payroll to do that, then?  What education and training system?  They aren't even processing applications to the specialist training programmes.  Are they?  I don't think they are...  I'm sure the 'junior doctors' (so to speak, since the 'University' (so to speak) wouldn't accept their sign off on their internship) can't wait to hear which 65+++ year old GP they are being pimped out to in the name of 'education and training' to do anything anything anything anything he says for decades...  Because he promises to retire in the next 45 years, or so, (yeah right).  </p>

                        <p>Nobody trained or educated the people over 65 who won't get out.  They don't know how to train the next generation and they have no interest in walking away from their pay check or the power.  Justice Toogood is past the age of retirement.  He is required to get out, therefore.  But he refuses not to keep having his days in court.  The Great Injustice Toogood.  Time to go, Sir.  Get the f*ck out.  Where are all your students?  Who are the people you motivated and inspired to go on to be good Judges?  Get the f*ck out.</p>

                        <p>How old is Robert Nola (the f*cking racist) anyway?  Time to go Robert.  I guess they had to supress my work on delusions because Richard Dawkins 'The God Delusion' came out about that time.  They were trying to have more and more people declared irrational and so on.  Lock people up for belief in God...  Hey Dawkins..  Why not choose to believe in a God who loves you?  Oh, you don't want to.  Well, that's your choice.  What's that?  The basis of informed consent?  You get to choose.  Professor of Philsophy publishing in the New Zealand Medical Student's Journal.  I didn't realise that he was a Medical Student...  Writing about first year Philosophy of Mind stuff for Medical Studnets who weren't allowed to study anything other than the prescribed Medical Curriculum Contents...  Teaming up with the Oraka Tamariki people who were all about putting targets on certain kids heads. The uplifts into State Care for the purposes of abuse, one can only suppose.  I mean, we don't think it is wrong to abuse people in state care.  We don't think it is wrong.  We know because of the lengths they go to to cover up and silence anybody speaking out about the crimes.  Their refusal to compensate the victims.  They can't get past seeing the victims as losers.  They lost.  They could have raped their rapist with a broken bottle, or something, but they missed the opportunity.  They were overpowered by the better man, at the end of the day.  I don't know..  Ask Justice Toogood.  I'm sure he'll take his day in court to wax on a bit about how it's the victims fault...  Punative punative punative punative punative.  What health system?  They are the weak and vulerable.  It's sooooo competitive..  The thought we would pay people to help one another is beyond a joke.  What education and training system?  Just get in there and take and take and take and take and take.  F*cking get out you people who are 65+ who never were taught much in the way of anything.  Just grubby grabbed your way all oppportunist into your payrolls.  Had your payrolls for years and years and years and years.  Time to get out.  Get the f*ck out.  Go off to the aged care institutions you made for you to spend time in the rest of your days.  The euthanasia drugs you wanted brought in when we don't have informed consents.  Get out.</p>
