                                <p>This website documents how Australasia does not have functioning health system, education system, or judiciary.  Nobody was held to account for atrocities around the time of WWII and they never stopped with them.  Australasia cannot claim to be 'rule by law' or part of the free and developed world.  The leaders choose to run the nation/s as a detention camp only. 
                                </p>

                                <p>There are no universities.  They won't get the students work out to external examiners.  They keep hostages collecting up more and more and more money from the government and from the student to keep them enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled.  They employ slavers, effectively.  I don't know if people have been passing my academic work off as their own (or re-attributing it to other people) but they seem to have a 'yay' or 'boo' theory of academic achievement which is mostly tied to who your Daddy is.  Then the idea is that the people on payroll can take the work and ouputs from others and take more and more and more money for themslves by forcing re-enrolment and re-enrolment and re-enrolment. There is no education and training system, here.  No judiciary.  No health system.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.
                                </p>

                                <p>It is the funding system.  The Government pays them (provides financial incentive) for them to keep slaves.  ARC and research funding is sooooo competitive that you want to ensure that you fail out of the university any student who might later become a serious contender.  We don't have any psychiatrists, in New Zealand, because we have a few psychopaths who must be the only game in town (like Dr Leeks).  But then psychiatry is not really psychiatry because the motto is something along the lines of 'only treat the involuntary'.  I mean to say, there will never be enough to go around, people who want help can't have it, we are too busy 'helping' the people who are screaming at us saying how much we are hurting them in fact.  Of course the government knows what is right for you and the hospitals get how much money for every hostage they detain in the name of psychiatry?  Also Covid and everything else...  And in these days of gofundme and kickstarter there is no end to the money people can get for keeping hostages.  Australasia is not even trying to be rule by law.  Maybe it has something to do with not enrolling or graduating anybody from Law Degrees (also Medical Degrees, also all the other Degrees...)                                </p>
