                            <p>Off to Europe now, Chris!!! Oh my, quite the Jet setter.  Where is Jacinda Ardern (our supposedly elected prime minister).  She announced to the graduates of Harvard that nobody would be prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus in NZ (weren't when it was a crime in the crimes act, and it isn't a crime in the crimes act anymore, apparently) and then she's off in the name of her mental health to be paid a million dollars, or something, to write a book on 'leadership' paid by Harvard.  What happened to her elected duties to NZ?  Now Chris is up and he's off to China and now he's off to Europe...  Take Chris Whelan with you.  He who refuses to acknowledge any complaints about NZ Universities in the name of upholding their quality and integrity.  F*cking psychopaths.  F*cking psychopaths.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                            <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/493126/cataract-surgery-eye-surgeons-worry-about-meeting-demand-as-more-qualify  Oh noes!!! Do you think the..  What is he?  70?  You think the 70 year old 'surgeon' who likely killed his DHB wife will come back from Sydney and help???  WHere are all the students he trained????  </p>

                            
                            <p>Ask the people on your payroll.</p>

                            <p>Note that the USA and China are not doing business in this judisdiction, anymore.  New Zealand is closed, for business.  Our politicians and business leaders are required to travel overseas to sign contracts in foreign jurisdictions.  Better start training up  your legal defense to be heard in foreign jurisdictions, then.  Since you will be accountable to them and their military, one can only suppose.  How are you going to find people acknowledged as lawyers by foreign courts who will choose to represent you?  But how can  you win, otherwise?  No more pulling judges out of retirement to claim to receive evidence that was never supplied and to refuse to accept evidence that was supplied.  But you'll never be extradited to stand trial, you think?  Turn this whole state of Australia into New Manus Island detention camp prison facility.  Do you think that China would do you the courtesy of translating your trial into English?  Why would they offer you translation services?  Why would they extend to you any courtesy that you refuse to extend to others?  Makes no f*cking sense, at all. </p>

                            <p> Don't worry, Ayesha is trying to motivate and inspire a  new lot of people to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the 'Universities' for the honor of getting to kill patients in the vague hope that if they start killing patients nobody will talk to them.  What do you have to do to get them to shut up their face-holes?  It is like the people responsible for all the delays in the abuse in state care inquiry are paid by the amount of time that they take, or something.  Alllllll the extensions for them, therefore.  The compulsory extensions for them.  More and more and more time to make things worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.  Why don't  you practice Medicine, Ayesha?  They gave you a training place and they say that you graduated.  Why don't you do your job, then?  When did Ashley Bloomfield last see a patient?  What happened last time he killed a patient, then?  It's soooooooooo competitive.  It's soooooooo competitive!!!  It's soooooo competitive not everybody gets to do it, nobody gets to do it, there's nothing there.  It's sooooooooooooo competitive!!!!!</p>

                            <p>I don't know how Amy and Sah do it!  They are supermen amongst people!  Able to work as an emergency room physician and able to work practically another full time job as a Les Mills Group Fitness Instructor Model leading high intensity training classes like Spin Cycling.  Able to be enrolled as a Medical Student while attending workplace internships while being able to work practically another full time job as a Les Mills Group Fitness Instructor Model leading group fitness classes.  I don't know how they do it!  Where they find these supermen!  Maybe want to give Amy a few more ER shifts if she's got that much energy to burn at the end of her ER day because that is not what other ER employees are saying about the reality of life as an ER physician.  She stealing the good stuff or...  What is the most likely explanation,  here?  </p>

                            <p>So...  All those people who enrol in Sport and Exercise Science qualifications...  They don't get to work as Group Fitness Instructor Models because that would consitute skilled labor, one can only suppose, and if there is one thing that we know about New Zealand it is that nobody will actually be paid to do skilled labor.  We will get the Chemistry PhD's and put them to work as marketers and...</p>

                            <p>What 'Education and Training System'?  It's soooooooo competitive there simply isn't anything there!</p>

                            <p>We really don't need to reinvent the wheel on 'best practice' and cry cry cry cry cry about  how it is alll toooooo haaaaaard.  Best practices have been developed already.  E.g., The surgical safety checklist that was origionally developed for aviation security regarding who is in the flight deck, their credentials, and the specific role they are playing in the operations today.  The check-list of what safety checks have been done.  Etc.  Our problem is that we REFUSE to follow best practice.  Consistently choosing people too stupid or pigheaded or both to do what it is that they are supposed to do.  Those who grubby grubbed their way into positions (just get in there and take it fake it until you have it and then it's yours and nobody will be able to get rid of you) say that there is no alternative to them.  No alterative to Dawkins f*cking seflish genes and the hostile competitive uncooperative prison camp detention facility that is the State of New Zealand.  So says the only one's you'd payroll.  What's that University of Auckland?  Better write another ethics paper on how targeting the children to be victims of the state is morally compulsory!  Only way to be made Professor in the garbage dump of a wasteland.  Best be writing papers for the NZ Medical Students Journal, then, Sah's a little busy reading the script for whatever relase of Balance...  Oh...  No, she's not.  She's making up her own flows now?  She's a natural!</p>

                            <p>Then what is supposed to happen?  You get given to a 65+++ GP as their 'apprentice' -- only they will never sign off on completion of training.  They will never write you a reference.  It's soooooo compeititive and there will be a job for you only over their dead body.  Did Kim Sterelny die, yet?  Oh please God, I hope so.  Then maybe someone else can get some research funding, for a change.  How many decades did the Australian National University keep Carl Brusse enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled in the doctoral programme?  Refusing to get his work out to externals so  he could be credited as having completed a thesis on personal identity, I think it was, in the first instance.  Refusing to pay him post-doctoral fellowship wages for working, then, under Sterelny.  So that Sterelny could get paid hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year...  Was he even the author of half of what was claimed to be his?  He was a journal editor, right?  So he took work from some and reattributed authorship of it to others.  So that he could be the only game in town.  The psychopaths have taken over, he would say. What training and apprenticeship system?  Is he f*cking well dead, yet?  F*cking hurry up and die you selfish f*cking prick.  Your payroll wasn't even enough for you, you greedy bastard.  Your wife's payroll, too.  What is your daughter doing, these days?  I'm sure she grew up to be a real winner, what with you setting an example of how you just get out there and take and take and take and take and take.  You big phoney fake.  You couldn't talk about your earlier work because you weren't even the author of it.  You big phoney fraud.  What's that?  You f*cked the dog you f*cking c*nt and other eloquent expressions..  So eloquent you were (yeah, right).  What education system?  *There's nothing there*.</p>

                            <p>And then he gets sick, and Amy gets to have 5 minutes of silence.  Good job!!!</p>

                            <p>Maybe send the un-elected Ayesha along with Chris Whelan to Malaysia on the next blackbirding expedition for students to enrol in nursing qualifications.  Visas tied to Calendar Girls etc.  Take Chris along with you so he can explain all the work that he does to uphold the quality and integrity of NZ University qualifications by throwing away all the complaints he receives about NZ Universities refusing to say they have  been formally lodged.</p>
                       
                       <p>Hi Souxie, NZ's 'personality' Dr (without  the Medical Degree) Born in South Africa trained in England New Zealander of the year...  Do your studnets (who work in your microbiology laboratory) have face masks, yet?  Just wondering on the infectious disease protocols that are followed by your studnets working in your labs...</p>

                       <p>Hey Souxie, congrats on your publication.  HOw much did you have to pay to get that?  I'm wondering because you previously said that you had to pay $20,000 or more to have your work considered by peer reviewers.  So I'm wondering how much money you paid or the University of Auckland paid to have your publication subjected to peer review.  Know what I find interesting?  Reading about how medical studnets aren't getting consent forms to do 'cervical examinations' where the cervical examinations sometimes involve pushing the scope or whatever device all the way up so that they can actually see the ovary!!  Oh  my!!! Hey, Souxie, what do you think the chances are, of collecting cells from the uterus and pushing them up the fallopian tubes?  WHat do you think the changes are of pushing the edometrial cells from the uterus, maybe through a hole in the wall of the fallopian tube (oops!) and so on?  What do you think the chances may be of that kind of sort of a thing.. As an actual *CAUSE* of endometriosis?  Oh my..  We would need to do a randomised double blind control trial of people who had had non or un consenting cervical exams (maybe under anasthetic for an unrelated condition) and those who didn't have..  Who wants to be in the non-control group?  OH, hey you don't get to choose!!!  F*cking psychopaths.  Hey...  Pay me later.  No worries..  You can just pay me later.</p>

                       <p>Why do we always have to follow so f*cking many years behind??? Sloooooooow slloooooooow slloooooooooooowwww</p>

                       <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/marlborough-express/news/132431427/diagnosis-to-hypnosis-blenheim-gps-career-tranceformation  Oh, my!!! How old was that one???  Now it's not so cool to be a medical doctor anymore you going to claim to be the very very best of allied health?  Where are all the students you trained?  Where are they?  Oh, did you eat them?  Absorb them unto yourself?  WHere did they go?  Maybe she will move into magnets next.  Because they are so magnetic, charasmatic, or something...  I'm sure her high quality training to be a GP and her many years of subsequent study have set her right...  And all the studnets she's trained, of course... </p>

                       <p>They want to say that visa processing is held up because they aren't being supplied with references, for example.  But people don't write good references for people they want to keep.  They don't write good references for people they don't want to have any opportunities except to crawling back to them...  People don't write references for people they want to set free or let go, or give options or opportunities to.  So if NZ waits to get good references then we will only get the people they are happy to see the back of.  Now, why would that be, do you suppose?</p>
