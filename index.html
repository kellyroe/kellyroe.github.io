 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>So I Just read a news article that claimed Ashley Bloomfield just made Professor at the Univesrity of Auckland.  I am confused, though, because my understanding was that he was a 'Doctor' in virtue of a MBChB (which is listed in the World Medical School Directory as an undergraduate level qualification) and he does not have a PhD, or an MD.  That is to say he is not an academic and / or research doctor at all.  </p>

                                <p>They must have meant to have said that he chose to give up his three quarters of a million dollar salary per year in order to study for his PhD or MD because he *wanted* or *aspired* to be made Professor one day.  That's the only sense I can make of it.  I mean he doesn't have a PhD.  He doesn't have teaching or tutoring or grading experience.  He doesn't have publications.  Does he?  Apparently he has a Masters Level Qualification.  I don't know if it was a coursework Masters or a Research Masters.  If it was a 120 point Research Masters Degree completed over at least 2 academic years (and one summer school period) or something else...  I don't know how many weeks of enrolment they recieved for having him enrolled...  I wonder if he is full fee paying or if they gave him a scholarship.  Will his sons still be living with him and his wife in their 1 bedroom apartment living in University of Auckland Accommodation?</p>

                                <p>Just think how amazing it will be for him, decades from now.  When (if) he makes Professor.  He will be all, like, 'well, people didn't really understand why I would give up a three quarters of a million dollar civil servant salary in order to follow my dream..  But I made personal sacrifies to study for my PhD with the University of Auckland...  ANd then I worked on my doctoral thesis for years and years and years..  ANd I was soooooo scared that they might simply choose not to get my work out to external examiners at all because it would be so much cheaper for the government to require me to reenroll and reenroll and reenroll and reenroll rather than paying me three quarters of a million dollars per year to have an actual government paid position.  And then I got casual work within the university tutoring and grading.  Eventually I got my PhD and tenrure.  Publications.  And then associate professor.  And then, finally, the capstone of my career I was made Professor.  And all the sacrifices I made seemed worthwhile'.  I guess that's something to look forward to, eh Ashley?  A sort of reward or capstone on all the hard work you did working away on your PhD over however many years.  The sacrifices you made living in University Accommodation and living off a graduate stipend or some form or sort of government allowance.  Are you really going to enrol with the Univeristy of Auckland because you want to make Professor, Ashley?  When does your enrolment start?  Who is your supervisor?  Do you think they will get your work out to externals any time within the next 10 years?</p>

                                <p>Apparently there is some lady in England who has worked as a Psychiatrist for the last 15 + years, or something.  I am not sure why they are choosing to go after her now.  I suppose they are supposed to pay her and they don't want to pay her so instead they accuse her of being a hoax or a fraud.  Anyway, Auckland is saying she doesn't have a MBChB.  But, of course, various people who don't work in Medicine and don't get paid to do any Medical work are acknowledged by Auckland as having MBChB's.  Ashley Bloomfield, for example.   I suppose they acknowledge his MBChB because he is not registered to practice Medicine.  Ayesha.  The guy from Hamilton.  Shane Reti?  Agrees to work minimum hours to keep up his registration only.  No more than minimum hours.  Do they pay him to do that or...  How does that work?  His patients can literally only see him if they agree to see him only during 1 or 3 weeks of every year?</p>

                                <p>I don't see how it is possible for someone to forge their way onto the class roll.  The cadavar laboratory (every laboratory) has a class roll that lists all the studnets who are enrolled in the class so the teaching staff can check that only people who are supposed to be in the class are in fact in the class.  It is not plausible to think that it is possible to forge your way onto the class roll.  Likely what happened was that when it was time to pay this guy...  They would rather pretend they never heard of him.  They would rather say they don't acknowledge his qualifications anymore.  They simply refuse to pay the workers.</p>

                                <p>During the Labor Governments most recent first term they stopped paying the teachers in the schools.  Said that it was an Australian Payroll Systems error or problem.  THey did not acknowledge that the teachers in the schools had graduated.  They refused to pay them.  The last thing Harlene Hayes did on her way from Otago to her position in Western Australia was fail at least 1/3rd of the Medical class.  They said that they did not acknowledge that they had completed their internships.  They had signed forms saying that they completed their internships.  But the University said they refused to accept that.  THey were not going to graduate them.  They could go into their positions as Junior Doctors and work for the DHB's in the hospitals.  But they would not pay them.  THey would need to keep paying the University for continued re-enrolment in the MBChB qualification.</p>

                                <p>New Zealand (and Australia) do not have education and training systems. They have prison slave detention camps.  Certain people are picked out all Stanford Prison Experiiment like to be in the position of oppressor and certain other people are picked out to be the oppressed.  And there is a system of prison slave or detention camps up and down the land.  PUnative insittutions of abuse.  The research output  of Manus Island was likely greater than the research output of the English Department at the University of Waikato.  It doesnt' matter whether someone manages the schools prisons hospitals universities aged care facilities early childhood care facilieies..  They are all the same.  Right Chris Hipkins?  The pipeline of abuse. By those employed by government to be abusers. </p>

                                <p>Whatever will Ashley Bloomfield be redeployed to next?  Supreme Court Judge?  Did he ever apply to Law School?  Don't worry, the University of Auckland can just say that they found an online transcript for him recording that he has his JD.  PhD.  They found a thesis with his name on it in their e-library.  I guess he probably pays them?  Right?  IN order to do anything anything anything anything anything with impunity?  How many teenage virgins will they record as having been enrolled in Ashley Bloomfields terminal masters programme, then?  Graduation scheduled for never.</p>

                                <p>I am going to talk about Carl Brusse because if I talk about how they treated me people seem very keen to make it personal and personally attack me.  So that is why I am talking about Carl.  Kim Sterelny boasted about keeping him enrolled for..  For  how long did the Australian National University keep him enrolled before they acknowledged him as having 'done enough' for a PhD?  I think I remember Kim Sterelny boasting about him being enrolled for 10 years.  But why stop there?  What they do is they move your supervisor to a different university when it is around time for your work to be sent to externals.  Then everybody tells you how garbage and rubbish and crap you are and your topic is and so on.  It doesn't really matter how they go about bullying and abusing people keeping them enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and reendolled.  I thought that it was about standing up to the bullies.  For example, instead of waiting for your supervisor to say 'okay, get it to externals now' or 'make these changes then send it out' you just hand it in.  Despite or in spite of them.  Not at all because of them.  But I posted my thesis via track and trace to teh University and still they said that they didn't acknowledge it because I needed to submit it in person (why think that).  They said I addressed it to thte wrong person (I did not).  It is beyond bullying and having people on and misleading them and so on. It's outright corruption.  They will not get theses to external examiners specifically because they want to collect up more and more and more money for having the studnet enrolled and reenrolled and reendolled and reenrolled.</p>

                                <p>New Zealand constantly cries about how we don't have enough skilled workers.  But we are refusing to graduate studnets who have met the requirements of qualifications because we don't want to pay anybody to work skilled jobs.  Ashley Bloomfield does not have any acdaemic publications but they say he is Professor now.  It is a slave hostage prison detention camp.  It cannot claim to be a University at all.  They will not get studnets work out to external examiners.  They will not allow them to sign teh studnets off.  THey will not graduate people who have met requirements for qualifications.  They will not hire only the people who have met requirements for the qualifications.  I suppose they collect up more and more and more money for people applying and reapplying and reapplying for visas and so on.  But very very bad people live here.  THey are not conducting themselves with any honesty or integrity at all.  They are not supplying applications to enrol, they are not handling applications to enrol properly.  THey throw away some applications in order to preferentially enrol the teenager children of the adminisntration, for example.  They are not acknowledging progression through the curriculum.  They won't employ people qualified to teach the curriculum.  They often don't really have curriculum contents.  They aren't fairly grading or examining or tracking academic progress.  They aren't really an academic institution.  They aren't graduating.  They expect studnets to hand over more and more and more money, they collect up more and more and more money from the government for keeping the studnet enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled.  Prison slave detention camp.  There is nothing here.  No doctors.  No lawyers.  No engineers.  No professors.  NO judges.  No skilled laborers or workers.  Slaves.  Hostages.  The governmetn appears to be fundamentally corrupt.  COrrupt through and through.  There' snothing here.  Nobody home.</p>

                                <p>Take a look at the theses that are lodged in the Univeristy every year.  They mostly don't contain enrolment dates.  We don't know how many decades the author was required to be enrolled or how much extra money they were required to hand over to the univesristy.  We don't even know if they have a trophy room where they simply take the work of some studnets and reattribute authorship to others once they have bullied some of them to abandon the qualification.  There is not an education and training system in this part of the world.  They dont' do any of the thigns they would be required to do in order to allow one.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>There was a Law Professor at Otago who liked to go to Law Camp for the 19 year old students who had been accepted into second year law.  It was renowned for drunken nudity etc.  I suppose it was part of the grooming process for the students so they would know what to expect on their internships.  And I suppose that is grooming, in turn, so they will know what to expect when they are given clerkship positions to write judgments, or do whatever it is that they are required to do in order to be acknowledged as having finished Law School and Registered with the Law Soceity etc etc.  Once it became publically known his role in encouraging the antics he was promoted and moved to take up a Professorship at Auckland.  Most highly valued esteemed member of the Law 'Profession'.  Harlene was promoted to Western Australia after failing at least 1/3rd the Medical Cohort in Otago.  That was her reward for refusing to sign off on their qualificiation completion.  I suppose she saved the NZ Government more than 1 millino dollars collecting up more enrolment fees from the students and not needing to pay people to pretend to be junior doctors in the hospitals (they are not acknowledged as having completed their qualifications therefore they are frauds or imposters in the hospitals.  The hospitals choose to 'employ' them because it won't pay them and the hospitals only choose to 'employ' them because it knows they are frauds and therefore it won't pay them.  They withheld acknowledging the teachers had completed their teacher training.  Said they were unpaid volunteers in the schools.  Volunteer firemen.  Volunteers for St Johns.  No education and training system.  Fraud.  Hoax.  Scummity scummity scam up and down the land.  No education and training system.  Series of detention camps for the purposes of abuse.  The government only??  Makes money off the proceeds of crime?  It has no money to pay workers?  How many slaves is Ashley going to keep at Auckland?  He doesn't even have a PhD.  Or does he now?  Where is the PhD you are going to say he outputted?  Where are the external examiners reports of it?  What a f*cking scummy scam.</p>

                                <p>So the people understand why we don't have doctors, lawyers, teachers, any skilled workers at all.  Because of the illigitimacy of the NZ government.  Proceeds of crime.  It is in the Australian Constitution that NZ is a state.  No vote altered that.  So it's still a state of Australia.  Australia chooses to arrange for NZ dollars to be printed in Canada to disguise further still how they will not pay workers.  They won't acknowledge qualifications.  They won't get work to externals etc.  I don't know why they want to pay Kim Sterelny so much money to keep slaves detained.  Why that's a strategy they wanted to see take over Canberra, now.  Australia's premire research institution .I imagine Manus Island outputs more research than the ANU.  There's nobody home.  Nothing there.</p>

                                <p>That's how our leaders choose to lead.  Apparently if htey didn't then they wouldn't be in the position they are in.  No f*cking kidding.  Corruption through and through.  A 'hospital' overtaken by security preventing and prohibiting the 'patients' from leaving is not a hospital.  It's something different entirely...  WHere are the informed consent forms?  There's really nothing here.  </p>

                                <p>The Education and Training Act states that domestic adults are eligible to be enrolled in programmes they apply to.  Otago and Auckland refuse to accept this, however.  They refuse to supply me with application to MBChB saying I am 'ineligible' because they think that they can decide who is and is not for whatever arbitrary reasons they want.  They say they refuse to accept qualifications from NZ Universities that are more than 5 years old.  I did not know that that was the value of a NZ qualification when I took up more than 100,000 of studnet debt.  They aren't keep education or universities at all.  They refuse to acknowleldge my GPA because they think that they can assign grades however they like for whatever arbitrary reasons they like.  They can simply refuse to supply transcripts, now.  Or they can simply record that a student was 'failed'.  They refuse to enrol me in programmes I apply to.  They record my being enrolled by them in courses I never applied to.  Waikato records me as being enrolled in coursese that aren't even listed in their calendar.  They are making up enrolment dates that don't correspond to any course offerings.  The Tertiary Education Commission says that 120 points = 34 weeks of work and that qualifications and courses and EFTS values are decided by them and the Universities must comply to get funding.  But the Universities are not complying and they are getting more and more and more funding from the governmetn who is refusing to pay qualified workers.  The government is paying the university to keep hostages or slaves and they put them to work in the name of their 'training programme' while the studnets pay the university.  The University won't acnowledge completion of their training.  The University gets them working the job in exhange for recording debt against the studnets name only.  They have not paid me post-doctoral fellowship levels of funding for all the reesearch they record me needing to pay for enrolment in masters or phd programmes..  More than decades...  They are keeping hostages or slaves.  There's nothing here.  There is nobody home.  </p>
