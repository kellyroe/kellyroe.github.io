                            <article>

                                <p>'Doctor' Ashley Bloomfield was a 'doctor' in virtue of being a graduate of MBChB (Medicine).  Medicine, in New Zealand, is primarily an undergraduate qualification where teenagers are expediated into the qualification when they are 18 and 19.  So that they can become, uh, 'enculturated', shall we say.  By the likes of Dr Leeks.  They aren't processing the applications according to the criterion they publish for the purposes of accountability.  THey are hand-picking people for the qualities that they value.  I don't know why Dr Ashley Bloomfield does not practice Medicine with his Medical Degree and his 'Doctor' title.  I don't know why he is paid more by the Government to work as a civil servant (not to see patients) and why they now think it is a good idea to pass him off as a PhD graduate (which he is not) and grant him a Professorship at a 'Univesrity'.</p>

                                <p>What a big 'f*ck you' slap in the face to all the people at the University who the University simply refuses to get their work to external examiners so that they don't acknowledge they have done a PhD (e.g., Angela the co-ordinator from MEDSCI142 they won't get her work out to extaminers so as to prevent her getting a Phd for all the work that she has done over how many decades in Medical Education?)  Instead they choose to grant Professorships to people without PhD.  What an interesting career-trajectory.  He hasn't tutored at Univesrity, hasn't lectured at University, hasn't been publishing or focused on publishing for University, hasn't been involved in University at all.  And nown he's given a Professor title that most Professors in New Zealand aren't given until they are junior lecturers and associate lecturers and so on.</p>

                                <p>Actually, thinking about the current head of Psychiatry at Auckland.  The guy trained in OBGYN in Spain or Portugal.  I forget.  I am sure there must be an interesting story as to how you go from being OBGYN in a land far far far away to...  Being enrolled in a PhD with the Uniersity of Otago under Professor Glue.  Only to be graduated in a somewhat timely fashion and positioned relatively swiftly to be about the only Psychiatry Professor to the Univesrity of Auckland.  Not sure how recent the hire was.  If it was before or after the case of the Chinese international student who was detainedin the Grafton Psychiatric Hospital in breech of her visa conditions so that she could be deported without receiving etiher of her double degrees after having been raped in a residential hall.  Was he involved in her detention and breech of visa conditions to justify her being deported?  Or was he appointed afterwards once there was an outcry about the University being a scummy scummy scam being run by someone who trained in how to prepare the sheep for maximum profits before starving them each and every year (the gist of McCutcheon's PhD from Massey in animal husbandry)?</p>

                                <p>Process my application.  It isn't that 'there is no alternative' to Dr Leeks and the like.  Professor Glue's Professional Glue Factory (get it lol -- some people somewhere will think it's funnny of the chortle chortle snort variety).  Drugging people into being quiet or, failing that, ensuring that Junior Doctors murder them into being quiet in that way.  I would imagine the case of the Junior Doctor who was suppling party drugs to party teenagers in Otago (who killed one of them), well, where was he sourcing the drugs from?  So...  The University of Auckland has some kind of lisence or allowance to manufacture LSD now?  So they can give that (all voluntary-like, after having informed them, I'm sure) to people..  Maybe people kept detained in the secure ward of the Grafton Psychiatry place (where there are no external visitors to bear witness to what is going on).  Why would you do that?  To have them believe they are psychotic, I would suppose.</p>

                                <p>Gaslighting.  Give someone a hallucinagen but don't tell them that you did.  Then when they start to say that they feel peculiar or strange or are seeing things or hearing things then you explain to them that they are psychotic.  They don't have the ability right now to make good decisiosn on their own behalf so they will just have to trust you that you will decide for them.  If they won't do it voluntarily then you can get a court order and get things done in that way.  Right?  So seem to say the courts.</p>

                                <p>My Medical Books (USMLE United States Medical Lisencing Examination material) say that people live really rather surprisingly well with all kinds of congenital heart conditions or defects.  That is or means to say that there are quite a few cases of people not knowing that someone even had a heart defect or deficit until they are older in life.  Maybe in their 20's and they get a check up.  Something like that.  Sometimes you do hear of people dropping dead after sudden exertion when they have never really exercised before.  They say that's becuase they had a heart problem that nobody knew of or about.  So, there is often little urgency in fixing congenital problems of the heart.  In fact, because the heart (also the valves and the vessles) are growing it is hard to know if things will right themselves over time.  The Court was supposed to rule in the best interests of the child.  But the Court did not hear evidence from or information from any medical professional to atttest to reasons why it might not be in the best interests of the child either not to have the operation, to have the operation later rather than sooner, so have the operation with blood the mother felt was more appropriate for her child.  The Court thought that what the New Zealand team decided was the only expert Medical opinion that the courts would listen to.</p>

                                <p>People die from not having the medical interventions they need and also want quite a lot of the time.  Wah wah wah there never will be enough to go around.  We are too busy forcing treatment on people who don't want it.  Only treat the involutnary.  </p>

                                <p>There should be international concern (because domestic no work-y) about the incubator baby situation in New Zealand.  Think how the kids used to be raised in the Russian Orphanages in ye olden days.  New Zealand aspiring to be like that, I mean to say.  The observational studies that were done in failure to thrive and failure to flourish in kids kept in Governmetn Institutions.  Giving women steroids induces premature delivery.  They tell the women that they are going to have a premature delivery so they best take steroids so they help the lungs mature to benefit the premature infant.  But the steroids themselves induce premature delivery.  So they get to keep the baby in an incubator.  Separating it from the Mother.  Insterrupting and disrupting the attachment.  They can get I don't know how much money from the Government for keeping the baby in the hospital.  Then they can call various things congenital or birth defects when the baby is under-cooked.  So to speak.  They can hook it up to venitillators.  That would be concerning because blasting virus infected or bacteria infected air (e.g., by not properly sterlising the equippment) might be an interesting observational study, from the perspective of some minds.  I would imagine that you could induce rheumatic fever in infnts like that.  Or maybe test out experimental vaccines.  Things like that.  I would imagine it would be relatively easy to...  What reason do we have to believe that these sorts or kinds of things are not happening?  Most people are trusting.  Most people don't realise how psychopathic some other people actually are.  The stories they tell themselves about sacrificing a few in order to save the many.  They think they are heroes.  </p>

                                <p>So, the kid was an incubator baby.  One thing that can happen is that the infant filial imprints on or attaches to hospital staff rather than the Mother.  And of course the hospital gets more and more and more and more money from the Government for each and every night that the hospital bills the Government for having and keeping the infant in state care.</p>

                                <p>new Zealand hasn't given the victims of abuse in state care their payouts yet.  Can't do / won't do.  But still busy busy busy ordering people to be placed in state care.  Can't clean it up.  Won't clean it up.  Dr Leeks.  There is no alternative.  All the other applicants had their applications thrown away.  Professor Glue.  There was no alternative.  Giving horse tranqulisser sourced from vet science or surgical anasthetics in the name of psychiatric treatment.  LSD in the name of psychiatric treatment.  The Professor Glue Professional Glue Factory instead of Psychiatry.  The prevention and prohibintion of the developmetn of psychiatry progrmme. There was no alterative.  Nobody else applied for that job.  They threw all their applications away.  The current PRofessor at Auckland.  To head the secure unit in Grafton?  The one with the different food contract to the rest of hte hosptial?  The one that doesn't keep medication charts to people being held under the mental health act?  The one that makes unlawful use of seclusion (according to Ombudsman's reports)?  The one that doesn't allow visitors on the ward?  That one?  We had to hire from overseas because nobody from NZ wants to be a psychiatrist.  Nobody applies to Medical School.  Nobody graduates from Medical School.  Nobody applies to do Psychiatry.  Dr Leeks is the only game in town.  </p>

                                <p>Process my applicatin...  Hurry up.  You can appoint Ashley Bloomfield MBChB with a...  Was that a 120 point research masters?  Was that a 2 year masters with 1 year of course work and 1 year of research?  Was that a decade long Masters? Was that a 'terminal masters' to terminate your academia?  You were booted out of the university with your highest level degree being a masters level degree.  So that you don't get to supervise PhD level students.  It's where academics go to die.  Isnt' it?  Enrolling in a Masters level degree...  Hospice of academia.  To be detained indefinately...  Why won't the Univesrity of Auckland get Angela's work out for external examinatin?  Who in their right mind could possibly think that she has not done enough for a PhD in Education for the academic work that she has in fact done in Medical Education?  </p>

                                <p>What University?  They won't employ Professors.  But then they can't seem to process applciations to enrol, progressions though trining, or qualification completions.  And now Ministry workers are going to be redeployed as Professors to censor (one can only imagine) their army of unpaid student slave workers?  Is that the idea/l?</p>

                                <p>'A new health system can't fix what is broken in society'.  Indeed.  But you also know what?  Fixing what is broken in society...  Wouldn't fix the health system.  Don't worry.  Squiggley's got it Squiggley fixed.  It starts by not processing teh application to enrol, recording enrollment in things not applied for or to.  Hoarding work rather than examining it.  Sending it out to be examined for qualification sthat were not the ones that the student applied to.  Stabotage undermining.  The lenghts they go to to ensure Ddr Leeks is the only game in town.</p>
