 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>
<p>This website documents how Australasia decided to stop having Universities in favor of having unlawful detention camps where they have people working as forced volunteers or slaves or whatever you want to call it.  It documents how they (1) refuse to enrol students (particularly domestic adults) in programmes of the students choosing because they believe they know  better than the student what qualification is right for them.  They make these decisions on non-academic grounds.  For example, making decisions about certain students needing to be enrolled in what they consider 'low value qualifications' because they have decided on the basis of information they have collected (e.g., race, decile or socio-economic status rating of the students parents, socio-economic status rating of the students high school).  
</p>

<p>This applied to High School as well.  They misadvise studnets intending to set them up to fail or do badly (e.g., telling some students they only need / are expected to / should study for 2.5ish secondary subjects before university).  They don't tell studnets about things like Cambridge Curriclum or US exams.  They intentionally withhold information about international education opportunities and the like because they want their own kids to have what they consider high vlaue things..  And then they ship their kids off overseas thinking that it is better for their kid to be third class UK or US than stay in NZ.  Else they think they have the power to expediate things for their kid in NZ, I suppose.  So they are happy for their kid to stay here and get all the honors and awards and training places for what things they themselves consider high value for their kid.  In all this... The aim or the goal or the purpose or the point seems to be to have teh biggest harem for their kid that they can muster..  The biggest estate with the largest number of dependents so that the dependents can cover the mortgage, effectively, and they can accumulate their property empire of dependents whom they can treat as badly as they like because this is New Zealand and the judiciary doesn't appear to function here.  Quite the meaningful life for all the 'alphas'.  Otherwise you can be 'beta' then.  Serving the 'alpha'.  'I'm so glad I'm beta it's soooo hard to manage a property empire I don't have the stomach for keeping people that poorly I'm soooo glad I'm beta'.  Or maybe 'I'm soo glad I'm 'gamma' I don't have to work half as hard as Ashley Bloomfield.</p>

<p>The website documents how they refuse to get graduate research to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit the work being examined by international community where independent examiners who don't know anything about the students socio-economic status or race or age or for how many decades the student has been forced to keep slaving for the university because the university refuses to get their work out to external examiners for examination because they have decided to traffick in slaves, only.</p>

<p>From supervisors simply refusing to do the job for which they are paid (refusing to supervise the student) to supervisors only playing a prevention and prohibition and stabotage role (instructing the student to make changes that were different from those required by external examiners that were likely to make the thesis less likely to be acceptable to international community) to the university simply refusing to get work to externals.  To the University keeping false enrolment records (recording enrolment in courses the student never applied to be enrolled in) to keeping false transcripts (recording false enrolment details and recording that a student was forced to '...' continue the programme under re-enrolment else 'F' was failed by the university for the programme -- because the university refused to get the students work out to external examiners.</p>

<p>This webiste documents how both the Australian National University and The University of Waikato refuse to get my research work out to externls.  ANU refused to supervise (apparently they don't have anybody employed in the philosophy programme to supervise graduate research) and Waikato did not really supervise ('I'm off on my holiday now see ya!!') and then instructed me to make changed different from the ones the externals required.  E.g., externals required changes to the substance within 10 weeks and the univeristy refused to get the thesis that I supplied within 10 weeks out to externals. They recorded I re-enrolled for six additional months before they would get the thesis out to externls.  Then when the external examiner (the only examiner outside the southern hemisphere) stated they wanted an oral examination (to see why the university was failing me) they recorded on my transcript that I failed.</p>

<p>The Australian Natioanl University would not accept my complaint to them.  They asked me to revise and resubmit my complaint 3 times and then they instructed me to rewrite my complaint clearer because they hadn't accepted that they received a complaint from me.</p>

<p>They have all had every opportunity to put things right internally and they refuse.  Australiasia does not have tertiary education.  They have a system of slavery and detention camps only.
    </p>

<p>If you look at how this part of the world advertises jobs and fails to fill them with people willing and able to do the job (in favor of people who will keep some segment of society in conditions of deprivation and abuse, effectively) then you can see the race to the bottom that is Australasia.  They don't appear to have any kind of self-preservation instict or desire at all.</p>

<p>The Judiciary also fails to function.  You can see over on the Judicial Review page that they do not appear to be willing and / or able to output a sensible judgment.  The one or two that I received from the courts early on were over-turned.  I was informed that the landlord (who intentionally wired a house to be a fire hazard) has subsequently moved to Queensland so he can continue on his good works over there.</p>

<p>There is nothing in Australasia.  Or, there is nothing for me in Australasia.  They like to exterminate people when it comes time to pay them.  Trying to be like the USA around the time when the endentured servants arrived and happened to die of maleria (shall we say) when it was time for them to be paid for the work that they had done.  It is in the Australian Constitution that NZ is a sate of australia but NZ and Australia both refuse to accept that.  Australia will not supply voting papers to NZ and they try and keep NZ as a detention camp for Australia where the idea seems to be that by treating people as badly as they can they will somehow motivate and inspire people to want to move to Australia.  That seems to be the reward granted to people who have exterminated enough New Zealanders.  For example, Kim Sterelny, after all the work he did undermining the Victoria University of Wellington (I would imagine it's about double or triple billing for keeping students enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and asisgnign credit for some peoples work to other people and so on) he got appointed to roll out the same dis-establishment campaign for the ANU.  So that now the administration says they don't have the willingness or ability to supervise gaduate research in teh philosophy programme.  For example, Harlene Hayes.  All the work she did culminating in her refusing to sign off on completion of qualification for 1/3rd the medical cohort in Otago (refusing to acknowledge that they'd been signed off as having completed their internships at the places the univesrity arranged and approved for them to do their internships in).  Her reward for undermining Medicine at Otago (such that a bunch of non-graduates are not-paid they pay the university they pay the university they pay the university to 'work' in our hospitals) is that she now gets to go roll out the same stabotage and undermining plan for the University of Western Australia.
</p>

<p>Apparently they don't need to sign me off becuase there never will be a job for me.  But lots of people they have signed off, there aren't jobs for them.  I mean, New Zealand never really acknowledged ANU graduates.  And also never really graduated it's own people.  Never really acknowledged it's own graduates.  But now the idea/l is that people from NZ who have already been picked to lead on personal (e.g., political) grounds can simply be given (or simply buy) honorary degrees from Harvard, for example.  That will be acknowledged only insofar as they were paid for or brought or purchased for all the wrong (non-academic) reasons.  That appears to be the value of a qualification.  That is to say, there is no value to the qualification.  Except that the people picked for all the wrong reasons feel less threatened, now, that they have the fancy titles.  That they are the only ones with the fancy titles.  And then everyone will catch on that the fancy titles don't mean anything...  And then maybe there can be such a thing as academics gain once the people who didn't want to do it anyway all piss off and go do whatever it is that they value.</p>

<p>Well, this is the story brought to you by the USA.  Right?  So we are all supposed to spend how many years working for the USA, then, so they can collect up all the work for you when you are a (documetned or partially documented or not documeted at all) 'student'.  Hey, I know..  How about you do a lot of 'work' to upload to your CV on github.  Just do a bunch of unpaid work for free and then they will pay you later.  Promise.  Pinkie swears it.  No?  I mean, they have already decided who is to be on payroll on quite independent grounds.  So far as I can see...</p>

<p>What do they value?  Best I can see they value 'party party party'.  That's a good reason to go to the Australian Natioanl University.  Right?  We can spend out time dressing up to have a party and upload a lot of photos on the internet to motivate and inspire a bunch of tourists to edu-tourism to the university to pay money for accommodation in the area and so on.  That seems like a great plan for a functioning university.  It can be known as party party party university.  People can just hang out...  And people can come here and maybe even steal or simply be given, all voluntary-like, I suppose, the creative outputs of the people that Australia considers low-value and go pass them off as their own works back home.  Maybe even find a wife?  No?  SUmmer girlfriend, then?  What is the function of the Australian National University when its own administration asserts it does not have anybody willing or able to supervise philosophy employed in the philosophy programme?  If they aren'w willing or able to supervise philosophy then why don't they stand down?  Apparently there are soooooooooooo many people who would give their eye teeth to be employed in philosophy... Or was that give their eye teeth to party party party party with the kiddies the philosophers picked out to enrol?  SOmething more along those lines, then...</p>

<p>I have put a lot of my work up on this website because I don't know who may have been passing it off as their own.  It is work that I distributed widely at conferences and the like.  I gave people write-ups of my talk as hand-outs.  None of my supervisors ever suggested that I submit anything to any journal so I never did that.  In fact they said something about 'imagine if every student submitted their work to journals, imagine how inundated the journals would be...'  I took it that they meant I should not do that.  I see now that that's how various people pass themselves off as productive.  Finding out who wrote the anonymous review article, I would suppose, and, if they are a student, saying that the work has no merits.  Then, once the studnet has been bullied into fleeing passing the students work off as their own.  I guess that's why Sterelny would say 'I don't acknowledge anything I have written that is more than 3 years old'.  That way it makes it easier for people to do that.  That's why they don't want oral examinations.  They only want people to be part of the scummy scummy scam.  </p>

<p>I don't know for how long the University of Waikato has been at it.  I remember Ben Gibbs resigned when I was an undergrad or honors student, I think.  He resigned over them refusing to get a history students PhD thesis out to external examiners.  The University said they were justified refusing to do that (and recording he failed on his transcript) because they had had  yakkity yak yak yak amongst themselves and decided that they thought his work was a neo-Nazi manifesto.  So they were not going to send it out to be externally examined.  Gibbs said that whether they were correct or not in it being a neo-Nazi manifesto was irrrelevant to wheher the work was of sufficient academic quality to be granted a PhD.  The acadmeic work was supposed to be exmined on it's academic merits and the University of Waikato was refusing to function as a university.  Keeping people hostages and refusing to allow them to do academic work.  I wanted to get away from the Waikato once I heard that, particularly.  Because I was concerned that staying in the Waikato meant they would similarly treat me.  So I went to the ANU.  And so they sent Sterelny after me to send me back without my qualification.  So I said I didn't want to do Philosophy (apparently it's sooooo competitive peple will give their eye teeth)...  I wanted to re-train in Medicine.  Since there is a appentiseship system there, apparently.  And clearly none whatsover in philosophy.  But it's like Homer Simpson is the peson in charge of the quality and integrity of our hospital system or something and he will only train Bart.  Partly because he trusts that Bart will not expose his incopmetence or ineptitude.  So we wait for the whole f*cking thing to implode.</p>

<p>Now the judiciary is imploding.  They don't seem to be willing or able to do their jobs either.  The Attorney General and the Director General of Health don't seem willing or able to do their half a million dollar per year jobs...  The New Zealand Vice Chncellor's Committee throws away complaints only and the Judge says he can do whatever he likes because he writes the laws.  He doesn't write the Statutory laws that give him a statutory function.  But he was responsibel for writing local policy to uphold our internationl obligations to protext whistleblowers.  They think that by refusing to employ people (keeping them as slaves) they don't have to protect them, though.  That's partly why they refuse to employ them.  That way there can be no whistleblowers.  See?  It's ingenous in psychopath land.  There is nothing in Australasia.  Unless you want to be a wrongful deathbringing pedophile who can be sooooooooooo charming and put on a fancy suit and party party party party party keep a bunch of slaves or keep people in coniditions of deprivation so you can take all of their stuff.  Seems to be what it is that we value.  </p>

<p>New Zealnd does not have an education and training system at all.  I don't see that Australia does either.  Party party party let's have a party.  Does teh USA?  I don't know.  UNC has me there for 1 year semi-documented.  That is to say I had a J1 visa to do some teaching (equivalent of their graduate students) while my student enrolment in Australia was put on hold and I was allowed to attend courses...  Whether I was supposed to hand them written work (for no credit) was not clear or obvious to me.  I chose to write for cognitive neuropsychology (I've put that writing up on the writing page) but I did not do philosophy writing for the university since I was not going to be credited with any of it.  But that was the pln for me.  Right?  I was just supposed to give all my 'work' away..  Like I'm doing now.  Right?  </p>

<p>
When Australasia cry cry cry cry cry that it doesn't have any people to do x what that usually means is that they refuse to pay anybody with the knowledge and skills and ability and even the training (insfar as there is anyting other than Homer Simpson trying to stay on payroll for as long as possible)...  There is actually nothing to work for.  Nothing worth working for.  Nothing nothing nothing  at all.  They lack honesty and they lack integrity.  The Judiciary itself lacks honesty and integrity.  They pretend or actually are unwilling and or unable to understand the conception of justice or fairness.  There is nothing.  Nothing nothing nothing nothing at all.  Unless you like to party party party, of course.  Find some vulnerable person so you can take everything from them and feel great about yourself.
</p>

<p>Difference vs Damage</p>

<p>What I remember coming out in conversation that didn't make it into my writing...  But was discussed in class...  </p>

<p>I guess the cognitive neuropsychology class got me thinking...  That insofar as there was much of any value in what was going on...  It was in the software engineering for the MRI machines.  That kind of a level.  To get better signal from noise out of the imaging.  Now...  That is a differnet skill-set to my skill-set.  But that was what I did in fact see that they were wanting, there.  The post-doctoral fellowships that they were advertising...  Were wanting people to do that.  So...  The higher level math, too, to try and sort out what is going on within the 'black box' of the time window.  2 seconds for mri I think it was.  A very coarse grained...  Average??  of a temporal smear of activity...  maybe it was 2msec.  Whatever.  Anyway...  I wasn't going to be contributing to that...
</p>

<p>
But...  My thing really...  
</p>

<p>
Policy was...  Maybe this was historic?  I think it was still current in 2006...  In the US...  They wanted kids to speak only English in the schools.  I mean, particularly the Primary Schools.  The Grade Schools.  They wanted to discourage or dissuade bi-lingual parents from talking to their kids in anything other than English.  They said that parents talking to their kids in languages other than English in the home was interrupting or disrupting or preventing or prohibiting them from having normal language development.
</p>

<p>In support of this political policy was findings about the usual or standard or normal neurophysiology of monolingual english speakers.  Something like 90 per cent of them having regional specialisation to Wernike and Broca's areas in the left hemisphere.  Language comprehension.  Lanugage production.  Regionally specialised areas.  They said that that was normal or typical or aspirational or desirable.  That was the aim or the goal or the purpose or the point.  Normal language development for English speakers who were monolingual (say) was an aspirational ideal to be rolled out or aspired to by the world, say.
</p>

<p>There was evidence that bi-lingual speakers or kids who were spoken to in more than one language would not develop the regional specialisation.  Rather, their linguistic capacities or capabilities were more widely distributed across or between hemsipheres and more widely around the brain.  
</p>

<p>Now, I said, that I didn't understand why it was not the monolingual English Speakers who were regarded to be brain damaged.  I mean, localisation meant they were particularly susceptible to loss of language altogether if they had a blot clot or something blocking flow to the region then they could have language understanding or comprehension disrupted or removed entirely.  Why wouldn't we think that distributed processing was better or more aspirational rather than the specialisation?  I mean to say, the neuro differences are neutral...  Or, if there are reasons to think that one way is 'better' than another I guess you look at performance both narrowly but also more widely concevived including robustness to being destroyed.  
</p>

<p>So then it was more likely harmful to not teach migrants both languages in teh schools, then.  I guess we are learning now...  Because Asian countries invested quite a lot in teaching their people English in School as well as teaching the local language.  Sometimes even more...  Right?  So there are many different Chinese languages and sometimes the formal Chinese that is taught in school is different from the language predominant in the home and then in school they are learning English as well...  Anyway...  I guess we know this now when we see how isolated and excluded the NZ governmetn has kept the people here.  And Australia.  The US perhaps less so.  But I think it is fair to say that non-English speaking countries have invested considerably more over the years on bilingualism and they are seeing some of that return now.
</p>

<p>I don't know what other countries found with respect to evidence of neurological specialisation cmopared to bilingualism in their populations.  If different languages might be encoded differently or have different local specialisation.  I am not even sure if I find it plausible about Wernike and Brocas regions...  Much of the MRI research is poorly done, unfortunatly.  It got to the point (*decades ago*) that people were critiquing it for being the 'new phrenology' which is to say these pictures with different parts of them colored in to represent supposed activity to a region was as meaningless as the measurements they used to take of the size of different regions of the skull or the lines they used to look at on the palms of peoples hands all trying to predict the future..  To use future prediction to control people in some way...  Anyway...  We clearly don't have the capacity to do our own software engineering for anyting like MRI scanners or what have you in these parts.  We have yet to pass through the 'new phrenology' phase of the developometn of science.  Yawn.  But you know how it is, in New Zealand, we must be forced to follow along only however many years behind.  The leaders will not have things any other way.  Homer gets told what to do and he does what he's told.  Right?  And he's happy and grateful and everything just moves along fine.  Until, of course, the inevitable kaboom sooner or later...
</p>

<p>Now, of course, people will wnat to be putting Maaori and whoever else they can find to victimise into the brain scanners so they can proclaim to the funders they found what they were looking for.  Scientific justification for treating them poorly and so on.  That's the idea.  Right?  Not just bad science but bad arts and bad ethics and so on...  I think I did start to see (a little, glimmers and glimpses) of what they could possibly be up to (what sorts of things people could be working on) trying to get a better hndle on the processing occurring in the black box or spaciotemporal smear of the timeblock.  I mean to say...  Colthert had the only...  MEG?  I think...  One that could image children in a relatively non-invasive way.  That had better temporal resolution...  So...  Theoretically...  You could get people doing the same task in different scanners to narrow down the signal...  Yeeeeeeeeeahh.  I think there is too much within-person variation over time...  Then you have problems of between-people variation and you end up with a mess.  Oh yes.  May was well be looking at their toeprints to see what is going on...  But I guess I haven't seen what people have been up to in the last decade or so.  Right, New Zealand?  New Zealnd is still denying that 1 EFT = 120 points = 34 weeks of enrolment.  Australia is still denying that providing your supervisor with a 100,000+ document...  Should at least go out to externals lif the supervisor is unwilling and / or unable to do the supervision job for which he has been paid.  I didn't get to do the other cognitive neuroscience course.  The one that would have had us reading more research papers.  UNC scheduled me to do ethics instead and there was a timetable clash which prevented my doing more cognitive neuroscience.  I guess some of the other students in that class would have been enrolled in psychology and likely some of them would have been working on neural code stuff.  Not sure if any computer engineering people or whoever does the maths programming stuff were attending.  I guess it might have been a fun course for them to take in conjunction with something like that.  To give them ideas for possible applications of stuff they may be slogging through a bit at times in tehir other courses.  I don't know...  Don't worry...  NZ can send a con-municator to tell us what we need to know.
</p>

<p>Ooooh.  THat's right..  THe imaging machines that Macquarie were getting were made in Japan.  The psychology research laboratory had a number of Japanese students enrolled in the programme.  I wonder what happened with them?  I wonder if they were signed off as having completed their graduate research in the normal time that that is supposed to take...  Or if various other people tried to take their work and pass it off as their own...  I do wonder...  I do wonder what happened there.  Maybe don't piss off Japan.  Australia.  But hey, this was all, like, a decade ago.  I don't think any Australaiasian had the willingness or capacity or...  *Permission* to learn the things that they would need to contribute to that kind of research.  Right?  The government probably would have known better where they were best to deploy their disposable slaves to.  Right?  So they can make a business case for why them getting in there and having a go at fixing your Berry anuerysm is worth funding (for a few special snowflakes).  Get the assembly line rolling rolling rolling along...  https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/surgeon-caroline-tan-breaks-silence-over-sexual-harassment-in-hospitals-20150311-141hfi.html  The Australasian dream appears to be to normalise psychopathology.  Well, not whatever it is they want to accuse me of being today, of course, but normalise certain psychopathology.  For example, wrongful deathbringing.  Pedophilia.  Rape.  Those kinds of things.  Those are necessary parts of career progression.  No?  Well maybe that's why I don't have a career.  Wink wink nudge nuge imagine if we can get all the little girls (and boys) to believe that it is so...  Then I guess they will pick what courses or jobs they want on the basis of how sexually appealing they find their supervisor?  Is that the end game?  And then they can happily live in a dunegon in their supervisors house, or something?  With a harem of graduate students or co-workers?  Is that the Australasian dream, then?  I see we can't buy Onitsuka shoes in Australasia anymore.  Will not ship.  Perhaps that's an indicator.

<p>https://m.facebook.com/EAMUSICHQ/videos/natasha-bedingfields-pocketful-of-sunshine-in-simlish/998748577675996/  The obvious next step for national party avatars.  Yawn.  And Jacinda Ardern is going to pay Elon Must $18 (or whatever it is) out of her own private funds, was it?  To have a Twitter account.  That she (and only she) is personally responsible for?  Is that how it goes?  So we know who to hold accountable in the international courts...  Since our ones appear to be on track for failing to function...  https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/478147/ukrainians-in-nz-feeling-like-they-have-failed-refugees  Yes.  New Zealand sucks.  I mean, how is it supposed to not work, again?  If every Twit who wanted to follow Jacinda Ardern gave Elon Musk $14 then...  The avatar, indeed.  Where did Ashley Bloomfield go?  How about Una Jagose? What's she up to, lately?  Has she got around to instructing Crown Law to prosecute any of the Universities of New Zealand for keeping false enrolment (re-enrolment, re-enrolment, re-enrolment) records and false transcripts, yet?  Maybe they don't have the capacity to keep software systems of enrolment records and enrolments?  Is that the problem?  The Computer Science Departments of New Zealand Universities can't or won't output graduates willing and or able to work for the University records departments, even...  Nobody home.  Hey.  Nothing there.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  Let's get the second years teaching the first years.  Let's get the third years teaching the second years.  Let the third years realise there's nobody home.  NOthing there.  No Degrees to be had.  Hey.  No Graduation at all.  Hire the fancy gown and get the photo in a gown.  New Zealand does not acknowledge it's own University graduates.  What, now?  It's own what?  Detention camp land..  System of state abuse in detention camps up and down the land...  Nobody home.  Nobody home..  Nobody home at all...  What does it mean to have a PhD from the Australian National University?  Best I can see or figure...  THey don't have any system of external examination at all.  That is or means to say they decide who gets a PhD on the basis of...  What, exactly?  They like you?  You get something hardbound with your name on it...  And they like you and give you the qualification.  THere's no external oral defense...  There's no external examination at all.  Is there?  Why did my 100,000++ thesis not get sent out to external examiners for it to be examined?  Why did I not get told 'you need to get us what work you have by x date in order for it to be examined at all?'  I don't think I've ever missed an examination deadline...  Never applied for (nor received) any extensions on my undergraduate work.  Not any extensions on my honors work (including my honors research).  Then, as soon as you get to doing research they refuse to get it to externals.  Why?  Apparently it's because the external funding is soooooooooooo competitive that your supervisor is the only game in town.  The only applicant for the funding.  Let's see...  Dawkin's Selfish Genes was quite some time ago.  The God Delusion was 2006.  That was the year I started my PhD with the ANU after having written a Masters thesis on it over the two previous years...  After having done a summer project on it at the ANU before that.  So thehy set me up to the world to demonstrate just how selfish they are, I can only suppose.  The whole University system or something.  What does it mean to have a University Degree?  That you are the descendent of selfish genes that would ruin the entire thing.  So far as I can see...  Congradulations..  WEll done for announcing to the world the value of an ANU PhD.  So anybody who wants to do anything anything anything their supervisor says in the faint hope that maybe...  If they slave for enough decades and do enoough housesitting or do whatever it is that their supervisor wants them to do...  Maybe just maybe just maybe... . Just maybe...</p>

<p>The Australasian Dream.  Acording to the legacy from England.  I suppose.  With inspirational and motivational input from all the deceased endentured servants of the New World who just happened to die of Maleria or Covid or something when it was time for them to be paid.

    <p>Hmm..  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj9c4kPRSGE  Make sure you turn on your English Subtitles...</p>

    <p>I am surprised we haven't heard anything about virus infected carrots being fed to rabbits.  See, after Andrea Howard got really really good at throwing away applications to Medicine with Otago they re-deployed her in another Government job so that she could get busy throwing away applications to do something humanely about the rabbit problem in Otago.  Why?  Because there are a bunch of people down there,  having oh so much fun, putting virus infected rabbits into blenders and pouring the slurry on carrots and feeding the diseased organs of rabbits to the rabbits in the winter (when there is little else for them to eat) in an attempt to breed mad-rabbit disease.  That's the aim or the goal or the purpose or the point.  Right?  To create the next kuru disease (disease of cannibalism).  Like how mad cow disease, best they can figure, was a disease that was manufactured by feeing dead cows to live cows so the proteins started to misfold in the brains.  Then feeding the diseased brains to people was supposed to infect they people.  With things that were not destroyed by standard steralisation techniques (e.g., autoclave).  I suppose that means that washing your hands is besides the point, as is operating the autoclave properly, and so on.  That was the idea...  Right? The idea behind there being 'no other solution' to managing the rabbits.  That was the idea behind throwing any other applications away?  No?  It wasn't?  I wonder about the food contracts, now.  And I wonder about who these people are who are handling the diseased rabbit organs.  Do they do that before they go birth babies?  Isn't that how Medicine traditionally fails to work?  Something along those lines...  I mean it's pretty disingenuous to think that the doctors knew not of the harm they were doing until Florence Nightengale worked it out...  It seems considerably more likely that they knew full well what they were doing as did many other nurses also.  That's why sooooo many are motivated and inspired to be the only game in town, now, isn't it?  I would have thought...</p>

    <p>I don't understand why people would rather want to be third class Americans or Australians or whatever in the UK rather than New Zealanders.  I guess that means New Zealand needs to treat me worse to teach me my proper place in this world.  I guess that's their job, as they take it to  be.  To sell out the people of New Zealand.  To undermine the education and health and judiciary and just be a detention camp up and down the land where everybody cannibalises each other (feeding them the diseased animals is a good start to their end goal, there, that's what the Australians were doing to the Fore people, best I can figure, and I don't see why they would have stopped in that rather than trying to roll it out to more and more and more and more of their own populations...  I wonder how the Aboriginal people are doing in Australia, more recently.  What evidence there is of the sytematic genocide...  How much work has gone into actively decimating those people and those communities, in more recent years.  There is no alternative.  Nobody else's applications were thrown away etc etc.  They voluntarily chose to burn themselves out.  Like the guy in Christchurch who just voluntarily chooses to throw himself 30 feet through a window.  Apparently.  All voluntary-like.  </p>

    <p>Obviously it's a combination of past traumas (inter-generational history where people grow up being taught they are part of a second-rate or third-rate nation) and their own personal decisions to embrace that ideology.  To seek the approval of people from overseas who confirm that view only.</p>

    <p>WHERE ARE MY DEGREES?   FFS....  IT TAKES THE F*CKING THESIS...  AND IT PUTS IT IN THE F*CKING POST-BOX TO GO OUT TO EXTERNAL EXAMINERS TO BE ASSESSED ON IT'S ACADEMIC MERITS FOR THE QUALIFICATION THAT I F*CKING WELL APPLIED TO BE ENROLLED IN.  It's literally not rocket science.  They managed to get other students work out to externals.  You will need to talk to the other students about what (if any) documentation there is about  how they supervised them (if they did) or whether they wrote the thesis for them or gave them another studnets work to pass off as their own or what the hell happened with all the ones they did in fact sign off.  Whether the other ones actually were given to externals at all...  Whether the externals were independent from the production.  Whether bribes were paid.  I don't know.  All I know was that they seememd to choose to make a f*cking example of me.  Getting me to write a bulk of a PhD before I was to start the programme and then telling me 'garbage garbage garbage garbage garbage' to collect up more and more and more and more work that they had no intention of getting to external examiners.  </p>

    <p>I guess you really have to do a number on Australasia when Oxford is telling the people that they are delusional to believe in anything other than Dawking selfish genes and when Cambridge seems to think that it's about the elite getting sexual favors from female students before they are deported with no qualifications or with masters qualifications only after having labored for years on doctoral degrees.  Too much in-breeding,  hey.  Well, then, if the colonies have to get in behind all that for...  How many years???  Or what, then?  Get in behind the USA...  By, what?  Pretending that  'no speak English' when it comes to the Australian Constitution.  Squabble squabble squabble sqawk.  THERE IS NOTHING HERE.  GARBAGE OUTPUT OF A F*CKING WASTELAND.  Our own leaders cannot sell out the health of the people (the education)....  Judiciary..  There's nothing here.  Nothing here.  Garbage garbage garbage.  Peopel from teh f*cking Ukrane are going back there becuase there's nothing here.  </p>

    <p>WHERE ARE MY QUALIFICATIONS???  WHERE IS EMPLOYMENT?  Cry cry cry cry cry THERE'S NOTHING HERE.  </p>

    <p>I said to Waikato 'if  you want to be a community college -- then do that, then.'  I mean to say.... If you aren't capable of enrolling studnets in the graduate research degree they applied to by the deadline..  If you aren't capable of offering adequate supervision (that means employing people willing and able to do that job) if you aren't capable of taking the f*ckign thesis and getting it to the f*cking externals and ALLOWING externals to examine it on it's academic merits and ALLOWING EXTERNALS to sign off that the student has done enough for qualification completion (that is to say the thesis is good enough for the qualification) then remove those qualifications from your calender.  And what's more..  STOP GETTING MONEY FROM THE GOVERNMENT FOR KEEPING SLAVES.  Because that is what you are doing.  Right?  You collect up all the f*cking work and what?  Give it to the people in the UK to pass it off as their own because they are unwilling and or unable to do any f*cking work themselves and they couldn't enrol anybody with the capacity to do it in their own qualifications.  I guess they threw away the applications from anybody with the willingness and ability to do it until they ended up with a bunch of sexual offending psychopths.  That was the goal or the aim or the purpose or the point?</p>

    <p>Sterelny was not sexually inappropriate with any of his studnets to the best of my knowledge.  But it's pretty f*cking sh*t that that's abotu the best thing you can say about your supervisor.  Hey.</p>

    <p>Excuses excuses excuses excuses excuses.  I am sick and f*cking tired of all the f*cking excuses as to how and why the leaders of NZ refuse to allow NZers to function and intentionally hire (and pay people quite a lot of money) to keep people poorly in New Zealand.  For example, the Dean of the Research School of Social Sciences at the Univesrity of Waikato (Kay Weaver).  She was a Nottingham Graduate -- right?  From the UK.  And her job is...  Or the job she has taken upon herself is...  To keep false records about student enrolments so that the Univesrity can say they have more students than they actually do.  Double billing and so on.  Recording that students were enrolled in 1 year 120 point 1 EFT masters research degrees for..  HOw many EFTS?  Over how many years?  Refusing to get the students work to externals to prevent nd prohibit externls from signing off on completion of the qualification.  Taking their rsearch work and passing it onto third parties.  I wrote my thesis 'disabiltiy and equity in medicine and public health' in 2018.  It was YEARS later that the government says that people on their payroll wrote a research report for them on that topic.  The topic they refused to fund me for.  Not so much as a $5,000 studnet scholarship.  They give my work to others and other people get paid how much to redact what they don't like and put a spin on it...  WHERE IS MY QUALIFICATION???  How much money they choose to pay other people other people other people other people.  Hiring from overseas hiring from overseas hiring from overseas.  To keep the people of New Zealand as poorly as they can.  People from Ukrane saying thehy would prefer to go  back to the Ukrane than live here.  THere's nothing here.  Our leaders choose to do this.  F*cking garbage land.  Of their own design.</p>

    <p>I mean...  THe number of 50,000 word 1 year things that were belted out by various NZ academics (or by their students) since I wrote my 120 point 1 EFT 1  year masters research thesis of 2018...  Some published by Briget Williams Books...  IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THAT F*CKING HARD.  Bring out the snipers from the sniper tower 'sloooooooow doooooooown Kellly...  Waaaaaait for Juuuuuustiiiiiiine...  Slloooooooow doooooooooown Keeeeeeeeellly'.  Yeah.  I've heard that before.  Just wait for the other kids to catch up.  Nonononono Kelly.  You can read.  Leave some things for other people to be good at.  That's not for you.  Don't worry about her..  She'll be alright.  Hahahahhahahahaha half a million for Ashley.  Who got the 2 year Master of Leadership at Harvard (to the value, apparently of a couple hundred thousand US dollars)?  Was it one of Ashley Bloomfield's sons?  Or did he have to pay for his kids to go to Harvard as full fee paying international students out of his half a million dollar salary per year?  Sloooooow dooooooown Kelly.  Wait for evvvvverybody else.  Kim Sterelny hasn't given you any feedback from your six monthly review, now.  Has he?  Where are his instructions of what you are to do next?  How about from your mid-term review?  Where are his instructions of what you are to do next?  Where are his instructions of when you need to get him a draft (or any writing at all)?  What do they pay him for?  To completely and utterly undermine the Australian Natioanl Univesrity as a research institution.  If they want to be a community college (no research.  Teaching only).  Oh, but they can't do that, can they?  Do they have any people teaching classes or courses?  A 4 year Degree to be followed by...  Indefinate detention.  Else you might be specially chosen all special like to keep detainees of your own.  That's the people on payroll in Australasian Universities -- right?</p>

    <p>At some point I was given someting (with an 'ooops haha' message...) From a Very High Ranked Australian University to someone with tenture.  The email subject from University Administration was 'rations' and it had the number of FTE graduate student enrolments for the department nd how much money was going to the department because of the FTE graduate student enrolments that were recorded and how much teaching and tutoring work and grading and so on needed to be distributed around (due to undergraduate enrolment numbers).  Then the academics distribute the teaching work to the graduate students and keep the research funding for themselves and pass their graduate studnets work off as their own.  Quite the scummy scam. 

     You've got the likes of Mr Burns ensuring that people who protest his taking candy from babies (taking qualifications from people who have done the work for them) never ever ever ever ever get to graduate from his most esteemed world ranked institution.  I mean...  The entire goal of life is to be Mr Burns.  Right?  And the people who are closest to you really really really want to sleep with you and will do anything for you.  Right?  Except that's your fantasy of what their fantasy is.  Projection...  See how that works?  Until kaboom.  Thanks for playing.  Some people had fun with that.  That's a good reason to go to University, right?  For the *experience*.  It's sooooo funn to go to all these drunken parties and see who you can take advantage of.  All the conferences and workshops where people just hand over their research so you can take it for yourself as you trophy once you've flunked them out.  I bet there is a physical documents room at Waikato, somewhere, full of trophies.  Trophies being all the theses that studnets submitted for graduate research qualification examination that they *never gave to external examiners*.  They just told the student that garbage garbage garbage garbage they are garbage rubbish crap garbage garbage and their thesis is so nasty and terrible and bad and disgusting that they couldn't possibly send it out to externls.  Else say that the externals said all those things about it.  I wonder if there is a records room like that at the Australian National Univesrity.  Sydney.  Auckland.  Oxford.  Harvard.  Cambridge.  Likely when Jacinda went to Harvard they showed her their records room?  Sometihng claiming to be one and asked her if she wanted New Zealand Universities to be more like Harvard (insofar as what they chose to show her of Harvard).  Something like that?  Seems plausible to me...</p>

     <p>Timeline.  How to complete 120 points of study in 1 academic year.  The University of Waikto says that the outcome of 'first examination' of a 'higher research qualification' (MPhil and PhD) is ALWAYS INEVITABLY 're-enrol for 6 months and submit for re-examination'.  That is because external examiners ALWAYS INEVITABLY feel that they would not have done their job properly if they had not have found a change they required to be made to the substance.  For example, re-structing a sentence.  Finding another reference.  That is enough grounds for the University to require 6 months additional fees to be paid to the University and another round of external examination.  And why would the University not take up the opportunity to take for themselves more money?  So, given that the outcome of 'first examination' is always 're-enrol for 6 months and undergo another round of externl examination' how are we going to complete a 120 point 1 year MPhil in 1 year?  That means to say without the University forcing re-enrolment in order to collect up 1.5x the fees?  Here is the timeline.  Day one.  Enrolment day.  This is your enrolment start date.  You need to submit your 50,000 word thesis for external examiantion TODAY.  On this very day.  That's a busy day.  How come?  Because then there is 3 months of external examiatnion, then 6 months re-enrolment, then another 3 months external examiantion.  That's 12 calendar months.  For a 120 point programme of study where the Tertiary Education Commission says 120 points or 1 EFTS is 34 weeks work.  So they force you overtime even if you submit 50,000 words on the day they record your enrolment start (and you aren't allowed to start work until the day your enrolment starts).  It's like the impossible triangle.  Graduate research in New zealand.  Universities in NZ.  Judiciary in NZ.  IMpossible.  I guess that's why they are a-hustling when it comes to removal and ablation etc etc of the frontal lobes as much as possible.  People lin NZ do not have the capacity to learn 2 languages.  The governmetn will not allow it (will do everything to prevent and prohibit it).  Everything that the US learned about how to PREVENT THE MIGRANT SLAVES FROM FLEEING BACK TO WEHRE THEIR PARENTS CAME FROM.  What's that?  Everything you thought was upside down and back to front..  THe undocumented kids of the migrants...  Who were US citizens by birthh.  Who were never told tey were.  Until the US got to thinking they could roll out the NZ template of a tertiary education system in teh US.  Right?  Several decatdes for a tertiary qualification was it?  People can go 'when I grow up I want a Degree from Harvard just like Jacinda.  What did she do to earn a law degree from Harvard?  I'm going to follow Jacinda!!!'</p>

     <p>We cant' really fault the academics for blackbirding for students when the Universities don't really provide much in the way of any information about the academics on staff.  I don't think there really are much in the way of any academics on staff anymore.  No doctors in the hospitals and so on... No judges in the judiciary...  The ANU administration said that they don't have anybody willing or able to supervise PhD research (on any topic in philosophy) in the philosophy programme.  That means to say the University is billing the Australian Government for funding monies to have studnets kept detained there as hostages or slaves. I suppose.  That is what they are pronouncing when tehy inform me that they don't have the willingness or ability to supervise philosophy research on any topic.  The people on payroll are either not willing to do it or they are not allowed to do it.  I guess it is the univesrity administration.  The hiring decisions they made.  The qualities they hire for.  The radiologists are supposed to read or interpret the scans.  What you see in teh tealeaves (if you even got the tealeaves for that particular pateint rather than being given false records of a person maybe being given the textbook picture of berry anuerysm that all of the patients or victims of a particular insurer seem to have scans that look like...)...  You can see why NZ is not ready for radiology.  Or surgery.  Or universities.  Or...  Yeah..  Just stay home everybody.  Just stay home.  Hunker down in your houses.  The goverment's building themselves fallout shelters under the 'hospitals' that they refuse to staff.  But they had such fun party party partying.  At least you got to see Antartica (the wasteland tundra of plastic) and graduate from harvard nd so on on your way out.  Right Jacinda? </p>
