 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p> My understanding is that the courts did not consider the question of whether the infant needs surgery (what options there may be and what risks may be involved with the different options).  The parents and courts all assumed that there was 'my way or the highway' with respect to what the surgeon / surgical team / hospital staff were saying and the highway involved the likely death in the near future for the infant.  The only optionw was open heart surgery apparently (not a balloon catheter) and the open heart surgery was likely to require blood products.  Nobody questioned those things.  Nobody questioned how or why the baby had a defective valve in the first place. Or whether the baby in fact had a defective valve at all.  That is important with respect to competency of the party that the courts wanted to grant custody to.  For example, if it turns out that they didn't even have a radiology report on the state of the heart and whether that kind of condition rights itself as the kid grows or not...  If they didn't even have secure imaging to show that there was the problem that they say that there is...  If they don't even have accurate records about the child.  If the condition was caused by (for example) giving the mother steroids to induce premature delivery so they could keep it in a Fisher and Paykal incubator in conditions that has a tendancy to result in enlarged heart size and various problems..  Then the competency of the surgical team / hospital staff would be in question.  It would be good to hear some expert witness or testimony from clinically trained people from overseas about best practice in circumstances such as these.  About whether the open heart surgery is the only option, whether blood products are even needed, whether there is reason to believe the kid has stenosis, whether there is reason to believe that operations are needed.  And, of course, a good review of precisely what it is that they are doing to the kid when the kid is institutionalised into their custody.  The decisions they are making on behalf of the parents about various aspects of care that tehy believe they are entitled to make following on from the court order.  Whether they are keeping the parents properly informed of the reasons why they are choosing to do things their way (what other liberties they are taking), I mean to say...  </p>

                                <p>They should just close down Medicine in Auckland and Otago and merge it with Veterenary Science at Massey.  Let's be honest.  And let's be clear about vet.  Nobody will pay you to look after their pets.  You get paid to arficially inseminate cows for the milk production industry.  You get paid to figure less humane ways to fatten them up for slaughter.  You get paid to dope race dogs and horses before they get sent off to the Professor Glue Factory.  You get paid to phophylactically supply anti-biotics for mastitus in cows (bacteria in the milk will actually increase it's protein content) and to the chickens so they don't get all infected rollling about in their own shit in their free range conditions.  Do those things sound like fun?  Medicine might be for you.  You can help the government manage the herds of people till it's time for the people to go away.  Make sure the people get their shots.  Cry cry cry cry cry for MORE MONEY from the government for the people slaves.  MORE MONEY.  MORE MONEY.  MORE MONEY.  MORE MONEY TO THE UNIVERSITY FOR THE KEEPING OF SLAVES. MORE MONEY TO THE HOSPITALS FOR THE KEEPING OF SLAVES.  MORE MONEY.  MORE MONEY..  MORE MONEY.  Gee, I hope that NZ didn't try and supply 'skilled labor' to Samoa..  THey only contributed empty shipping containers (and expired vaccines -- right) ...  Right?  Best case.  They only contributed empty shipping containers.  What's that?  Oh. It's sooo competitive.  You lose.  We win.  What do we win?  The how low can we go competition.  Yeah, right.</p>

                                <p>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/politics/pm-jacinda-ardern-fronts-post-cabinet-immigration-announcement-expected-miq-ombudsman-report/R2Z5SQEGJVC7FJYW2MRMTX3DVI/  All the people who we refuse to graduate.  We refuse to graduate.  We refuse to enrol, progress through qualifications, we refuse to graduate.  All of the graduates from off-shore who they refuse to graduate..  Apply to here.  Pay us money pay us money pay us money ka toua.  Pay us money.  Never stop paying us money while we refuse to graduate.  We refuse to acknowledge your graduation.  We refuse to acknowledge your skills.  Don't get sick Jacinda!! DOn't get sick now, ya hear?  What's that..  You needed your wisdom teeth removed and thought that was an opportunune time to promise dentistry for us all.  And then you recovered from the anasthetic (one way of putting it) and go back to refusing to enrol, refusing to train, refusing to graduate.  Refusing to publically advertise positions.  Refusing to hire.  Refusing to pay.  Nothing to see here.  Hey, pay us money to apply to immigrate.  We are sooooooo cmopetitive.  Never stop paying us money.  Never stop paying us money.  Never stop paying us money.  Dont' get sick now, ya hear. </p>

                                <p>https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2022/12/asthmatic-3yo-dies-after-health-staff-fail-to-give-her-oxygen-overdose-her-with-adrenaline.html  C'mon now, they never would have paid him money to work that job if he hdn't have agreed to exerminate as many people as possible with his paid position by the Government.  Only graduate the incompetent.  What's so hard to understand about that?  Most competitive medical graduate workforece in the world.  Literally falling over each other to kill the most-eset.  Not going to process applications to enrol by anybdoy else.  Dr Leeks 2.0 wanna bees only need apply.  Can I help you?  Can I help you?  Can I help myself to you?  Never stop never stop never stop giving us money.  Half  a millino for the CE of the DHB to pretend to be too f*cking stupid to process the applicatons to work with the DHB.  Too f*cking stupid.  Application process no work-y no more.  Duuuuuh.  All the students will pay the university (the 'university') to work that job for free.  How much money can we get for stealing their organs etc?  NEver stop paying never stop paying never stop paying it's sooooo competitive.  Soooo competitive.  Only the best and the brighteset.  Only the richest.  Only those taking the most-est money.  Never stop giving them money never stop giving tehm money.  THey only wnt to help people.  Good to know what 'helping people' looks like.  Helping themselves to people.  I think some vets treat some animals better...  Just hand it over to vet science already.  At least they give the battery chickens timely antibiotics.  No rheumatic fever in the battery chickens.  Their lives are worth more.  Go figure.</p>

                                <p>See..  The New Zealanders watch Shortland Street and pay the Universities tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars (investing in their education it's called) to train how to be nurses and doctors and midwives and the like.  And then when it's time to graduate them from their qualification and pay them for the work the government refuses to graduate them.  Simply withholds their qualifications.  Relies on immigrants to pay the government to submit visa applications.  Then they say tehy will employ graduates of foreign training programmes.  And then once they've invested so much money and time and effort they say that they won't acknowledge their foreign qualifications and they can pay the universities in NZ for a new education and traiing programme.  Which they have no intention of ever saying they have garduated from.  Rather, they work the job but their salary is diverted to the university because they pay the university they pay the university they pay the univesrity until they die.</p>

                                <p>So..  Let's  be honest.  No doctors.  NO lawyers.  NO nurses.  NO teachers.  There's nothing.  Actually and truly.  The Governmetn who faile dto process applicatons to enrol, failed to acknowledge progressions through trianing, failed to employ people willing and able to work that job (of training the new generation), faile dto garduate the new generation.  Faile dto publically advertise jobs.  Failed to engage in fair selection process.  Cry cry cry cry cried for immigrant slaves to come here and pay the universities pay teh 'universities' pay the 'universities' for refusing to employ anybody willing and able to train tehm.  What a scummy scam of a garbage land at the arse end of the world.  No self preservation instict.  Nothing to see here.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  Nada zip zilch zero.</p>

                                <p>https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/politics/immigration-announcement-sectors-welcome-changes-focus-now-on-improving-pay/  The whole Australasian plan is to send the criminals here where they can be held as prisoners or slaves to the happy few.  The elite white minority (with the odd brown-ish face so as they can say they aren't racist).  It's soooooo cmopetitive they want only the people with no other options.  That way they can treat them as badly as they like.  Internationally qualified people can come here and then learn that the NZ accreditation people likely won't accredit them until they have documented them as pedophiles and the like (most valuable, most desirable).  Then we can traffick them all around and ensure that various people aren't allowed to sit exams or if they do their test answers get changed and we can cry cry cry about how f*cking stupid they are and collect up more and more and more and more money until we kill them.  Right?  What a great idea.  The prevention and prohibition of development for the purposes of traffickign in slaves programme brought to you by Australasia.  I think maybe when Putin said about Australasia siding with the Germans...  The idea is that when countries agree to be at war with each other what they do is they trade their undesirables.  That way they can kill and imprison and torture and run medical experiments on the enemy.  You see.  Preferably people who speak a different language and who look different so that it's easier to tell what side people are supposed to be on.  That way they mutually consent or agree to exliminate the problem that each of them has.  Right?  New Zealand can't just repurpose an animal abbooitar to handle the studnets it refuses to graduate (because then they would have to pay them) or, better yet, the workers it refuses to pay (how long are people supposed to put up with 'Australasian Payroll Processing no work-y aye'...  So after they've done all the slave labor the goverment thinks it's entitled to it can actually hand the children over to the Nazi's.  That's the idea of it.  Instead of having your own gas chamber (which NZ likely doesn't have the engineering capacity to organise let's face it) you can simply ship your undesirables off to the Germans.  Thanks Germany for exterminating our undesirables for us.  That's the meaning of the higher-level co-operation.  The collusion for 'war'.</p>

                                <p>
                                Of course, it would likely be cheaper for NZ to simply drown them by downing the ship on the way out.  I would imagine or suppose.  Take them into the Australian Outback (it might be difficult to train Australian Soldiors to treat Australans poorly and kill them etc  -- but perhaps not.  Most desirable Australians ever...)  Ship them to Japan.  I don't know...      
                                </p>

                                <p>Why? Because of all the f*cking useless manageers of the administration of management administration of administering all the funds me-wards.  Ashley needs half a million per year ot be motivated and inspired to work his job and the vice chancellor of here there and everywhere needs somewhere  between quarter and half a million.  All the people in NZ who need to have quarter and half a million.  All the contractors getting paid for 2FTE or 3FTE or 4FTE or 5FTE while refusing to allow studnets to complete 1EFT of study  because they get more and more and morem and more and more money for themslves for working a job that doesn't involve them actually doing anything.  Chris Whelan has the statutory function of upholding the quality and integrity of NZ Univesrity qualifications.  He choosese to allow AUT to enrol 14 year old female studnets from Vietnam who come to NZ with a 'guardian'.  He chooses to not process any of the complaints of wrongdoing that he recieves.  He literally tells them that their problelms are all entirely personal and refuses to process them.  He gets paid quarter of a million dollars to do what?  </p>

                                <p>It would cost 100,000 per year, apparently, to keep him in prison.  That's money to hire someone willing and able to do the job, money to imprison him, and savings to boot.  How can we afford not to?  HOw many people need to die slaves so that Chris Whelan can have all of the money that he thinks he's f*cking well entitlted to.  So that he can throw complaints away?  HOw many people need to die so Ashley can feel superior?  HOw insecure can he possibly be?  How much money would you need to pay a solicitor and attorney general to actually instruct crown law to prosecute corruption for a change?  To actually hire lawyers competent to successfully prosecute corruption from within the exective?  One hall of a lot less than the amount of money paid to Una Jagose to throw the f*cking evidence away (e.g., instructing the desstuction of documents).</p>

                                <p>It is not plausible to think that the government is that f*cking incompetent that it can't employ people to keep secure software systems.  It refuses to do so so it can alter official records.  It insists on keeping online records of studnets transcripts where the NZ Universities will supply transcripts to prospective employers.  For hte purposes of stabotage, one can only suppose. Why would they supply references to their slaves?  It doesn't make any sense.  Why would they do that?  THey have no integrity whatsoever.  They refuse to process applicatons to enrol. They refuse to pay people willing and able to train a workforce.  They refuse to graduate studenets working to internationally accepted standards.  THey refuse to allow international community tos ay that they are working to international stndards. They refuse to pay workers.  They traffick in slaves.  Australasia:  Slave Traffickers.  No understand-y their own constitution.  No spikkity the English.</p>

                                <p>I go on about that because NZ universities say that they can't pass studnets because their English isn't good enough.  People with very good English are failed by them because they say their English isn't good enough.  Then you look at the peple they pass and employ and they cry cry cry cry cry about how they aren't legally responsible or accountable for anything they do because of communication problems and no speak english.  Plalusible deniability?  Must have!!!  Only those who can't read manufacturers instructions need apply.  Just have a yakkity yak yak about how we do things (how we don't do things) around here and never stop giving us money to keep slaves.</p>

                                <p>I don't see how international community can do business with NZL when the courts refuse to uphold the laws in this jurisdiction.  (1)  Costs.  There is a schedule of costs in the back of the High COurt Rules book.  The book that says 'removal from office' is a remedy for Judicial Review of Administrative Action and that damages may also be awarded as a remedy and also that no specific remedy need be asked for in the filings.  (2)  Legal Fees.  This is the money that goes to the lawer to represent you and do the filings.  (3)  Damages.  Because of the f*cking mental anguish caused by having to deal with f*cking psychopath incompetents (you choose, I guess they don't have to be mutually exclusive).  It is supposed to be more costly for the government to persist in crimes than it would be for the goverment to stop it.  Half a million to Una to order the destruction of Evidnce.  Half a millino to Ashley for failing to make the lock-down lawful (he had one f*cking job to do).  Quarter of a million to Chris Whelaln for refusing to process a single complaint of wrongdoing.  New Zealand has about the lowest rate of successful lprosecution of corruption related offences in the world.  Not because tehre is no corruption here - but because things are sooooo corrupt  here that he government refuses to allow there to be any prosecution . What lawyers?  They won't process the applications to enrol, they won't train tehm, they won't graduate them, they won't employ them.  The courts refuset to award legal fees to them when they successfully prosecute wrongdoing.    </p>

                                <p>Come to New Zealand!  Best place in the world to be a wrongful deathbringing pedophile!!!!  Nobody will ever prosecute you.  ANd even if they did the prisons are too full of the likes of Brian Tamaki who must be kept locked away to ensure that nobody votes for him. What a f*cking farce of a sh*t-hole.  People get sucked into thinking that there' sa skills shortage here.  Nobody was more competent than these f*cking imbecels.  But the problem is corruption.  ANybody more cmopetent than these f*cking imbecels were exterminated or kept as slaves by these f*ckign imbecels.  The problem with New Zealnd is the traffickign of slaves.  Never stop paying the government money to do anything anything anything anything anything to the least valued people int eh entire world.  Come here and sexually molest the children ward of the New Zealand Government.  They won't prosecute anybody.  But even if they did they would wait until they die before they would ever give compensation.  Ther'e snothing here.  Scummy wasteland of garbage.  Where's the f*cking evidence to the contrary???  How f*cking hard can it possibly be to have an application processed on it's f*cking merits (according to the f*cking criterion that was f*cking published for the f*cking purposes of acountability?)  THere is no accountability here.  THeir maths doesn't work.  ALll of the FTE for them.  ALLLLLL of the FTE for them.  ALLLL of the FTE for them.  Millions and millions and millions of taxpayers dollars for them so that they will not pay the workers.  there's nothing here.  What economy?  States are not allowed to print their own money.  Australia orders 'New Zealand Dolllars' to be printed in Canada.  What a f*cking farce of a hoax of a scam.   </p>

                                <p>Something something about a Northland hospital who doesn't have a single doctor on payroll to work in the evenings.  Will  not do it.  Will not pay for anybody to work that job.  Anybody willing and able to do it isn't enrolled in Medical School.  But even if they were they would never graduate them.  But even if they would not publically advertise the poistion.  But even if they did they wouldn't fill it.  But even if they did they wouldn't pay anybody to work that job.  What are they waiting for?   Some pedophile from overseas can come here and pretend to work that job for a time so the locals can learn that healthcare is not for them.  The government takes all of the tax money and pays various CE's hundreds of thousands of dollars per year and refuses to pay doctors and teachers and nurses and so on.  Of course, I would imagine that there aren't doctors on payroll to work the overnight shift in..  THe majority of urban hospitals also.  I mean, there might be the odd building apprentice running around the OR's seeing who can be fiddled with or rented out for cheap, but that's the reason why anybody arriving after a certain time in the afternoon won't be seen until teh people arrive to start work the next morning.  Right?  Because there aren't any doctors in the hospital in the evenings to work the overnight shift.  THey won't pay anybody to work that job.  NOthing here.  Nobody home.  They might get the odd studnet to pretend to do it.  LIke they get the odd student to pretend to practice their physical or clinical examination skills on involuntary people being detained for mental heatlh act holds, for exmaple.  I mean to say they aren't practicing their clinical or physical exmaination skills at all because the pre-condition for doing a clinical or physical examiantion is informed consent.  WHich is the difference between vet science (where you might well get your hand bitten off but then of course a death sentence is passed) and Medicine.  Which, fairly clearly, we do not have.  Will not have.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  I don't see any people?  Do you?  Does the governmetn?  Don't give up your day job Shane Reti.  Ashley Bloomfield.  NIce to see them putting their Medical Degrees to use.  Maybe ask them why they didn't want to practice Medicine.  Were they allowed?  WOuld anybody pay them to work that job?  Did they follow the trail of money, did they? </p>
