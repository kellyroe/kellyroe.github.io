                             <p>I am not entirely sure what to do about revisions.  I will fix minor typographical errors as I find them (the fact that they remain indicates something about the level of supervisory input that was provided to me by various people kept on payroll):</p>

                             Not sure what date to put on that.  The Australian National University has inserted the table of content into my student record notes as evidence they were supplied with the document that is of sufficient length for doctoral examination during a time in which I was enrolled as a doctoral candidate.  Maybe ask them when they intend to schedule the public oral defence?  I haven't received reports from external examiners, yet.  Does anybody enrolled in the ANU get reports from external examiners and hold a public defence?  Ever?  Is it a university -- or a prison slave or detention camp?

                         </p>

                                <p><a href="./publish/2013-rep.pdf">Roe, (2013).  A few small chunks for 2013.</a>
                                </p>

                                <p>Sterelny referred to the above as a `few small chunks' so I'm taking him to be authorative on that.  The entire work is masters length.  But perhaps he was only focussed on the few small chunks that referenced himself.</p>

                                 <p><a href="./publish/2018-rep-1.pdf">Roe, (2018).  Disability and equity for medicine and public health (September, 2018)</a>
                                </p>

                                  <p><a href="./publish/2018-rep-2.pdf">Roe, (2018).  Disability and equity for medicine and public health (October, 2018)</a>
                                </p>

                                <p><a href="./publish/2019-rep-1.pdf">Roe, (2019).  Disability and equity for medicine and public health (February, 2019)</a>
                                </p>

                                <p><a href="./publish/2018-rep-2.pdf">Roe, (2019).  Disability and equity for medicine and public health (June, 2019)</a>
                                </p>

                                <p>The above is a 120 point 1 EFT 34 weeks (including the external examination period) full-time MPhil enrolment.  The `University' kept me enrolled for a couple years.  120 points and then I get a letter that I would say is extortion demanding that I re-enrol and pay additional fees for 20 additional EFTS else would `never qualify to complete the degree'.  THey then recorded that I was to be kept enrolled under the zero fee enrolment scheme indefinately.  What University?  There isn't anything there.  They won't pay workers.  Ask to see the research outputs of people who are payrolled and really question them as to whether they are in fact the author of the work they claim to be their own.  There's really nothing there.  Not so far as I can see.</p>

                                <p>The only external examiner  based outside Australasia wrote that there should be an oral defence.  So the `University' of Waikato updated my transcript to say that I failed the qualification.  What University?  There doesn't seem to be anything there.</p>

                                <p>They aren't processing applications to enrol, properly.  The Australasian response to the Univesrity of Queensland enrolling the VC's daughter even when various other candidates were higher on their ranking according to the objective criterion they published has been to escalate that problem.  My CV shows how the `University' of Otago is not even pretending to be making academic based enrolment decisions when it comes to MBChB and Auckland is not, either.  They refuse to accept my conferred qualification GPA and they refuse to get my research out to externals so they can expedite their own children into position to manage the death camps.  That seems to be the ideology of it all.  There's nothing there.  The Glue Factory is the there quite by design.  Dr Leeks was moved to Australia in order to facilitate his ongoing crimes.  They will have things no other way.  It's so competitive and so hostile.  There's nothing there.</p>
