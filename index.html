                        <div class="container">

                            <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/checkpoint/audio/2018908581/national-says-traffic-light-policy-for-beneficiaries-driven-by-love  Chris sleeps in his suit - doesn't he?  I hear some people are expected to turn up for interview in their birthday suit.  I suppose that's the ideal, isn't it?  Everyone who won't do anything anything anything John Key says outside a nightclub on a friday night for a quick $20 isn't serious about looking for work so they are 'ineligible' to be on a government benefit.  Lowest government benefit rate ever!  Of course then Chris will likely have problems showing his face in public because the people will have realised that the only way they are ever going to get to wear a suit (for example) is if they peel it off of his cold dead body.  That's why you look at how many full time employment positions there actually are, and whether the people in them are between the ages of 20 and 65, or not.  The under 20's are entitled to a free secondary education, you see, but the governmetn wants to starve them out of that and put them to 'work' in the brothels etc.  Then they turn 20 and it's time for the glue factory for them, hey.  Best plan for the economy ever! </p>

                            <p>NZ government says:  We don't have any doctors, teachers, nurses, etc etc.  No skilled labor.  Nobody will work those jobs.  Aka we won't pay anybody to work those jobs.  They are all on strike because we won't pay them!!!</p>

                            <p>I remember reading something about male circumscision.  About why our attitudes are often different about male vs female circumscision.  One line of argument was that some said that it was medically recommended for boys because they wouldn't wash themselves properly so it was unhygenic.  The response to that was that we don't cut off people's hands because they don't wash them properly.  I suppose what they were getting at was that a large part of the problem would likely be solved if they did in fact cut off the hands of the 'surgeons' who thought it was medically advised or recommended who would not even wash their own hands.  Maybe Chris can go visit the operating theatres, next?  They won't even roll up their sleeves, anymore.  They think they are being 'common-man' by loosening the nooses around their necks.  Barely pretending even to try to win votes.   </p>

                            <p>So now apparently Jacinda has been photoshopped to say that she now wants to say that she didn't have a mental health problem when she chose to walk away (all voluntary-like) from a $NZD 250,000+++ salary in exhange for...  Unemployment.  She then voluntarily chose to walk away from a paying job and enter foreign terrain and she was offered 3 fellowships from Harvard when she never applied for 1!  She didn't feel that it was her duty as elected prime minister to see out her term.  She just admitted to the Kennedy Leadership students (or similar) that she did not stick to the campaign budget the last couple times (in other words she cheated in order to have  been elected in the first place, and then again -- otherwise she doesn't think she would have actually been elected at all) and now her reward for cheating is...  To motivate and inspire people to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay to send their children to Harvard so they can be educated by the likes of her.  </p>

                            <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/homed/buying/300974895/firsthome-buyer-help-we-made-a-good-offer-on-a-house-why-was-it-declined  Ah.  So probably it's because you have this little mark by your name that says you were born only to be a Fisher and Paykal Incubator Baby so home ownership is not for you.  Or maybe you were just an absue in state care survivor.  However much government funding has gone into the narrative that you will never have a house or car or various other things.  So, even if you do scrape the funds together (even by legitimate means) home ownership is not for you. Sorry.  Better luck next generation.  Only no.  Haha.  Because they were born from the likes of you.  Sorry.  Haha . Only not.  You lose.  Haha.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha.  It's personal.  Must be all personal.  </p>

                            <p>What is the rate of employment, again, in NZ?  How many people, in NZ, actually have paid full-time employment?  We know why the unemployment rate is so low.  It's all very very very personal that they refuse to count people who don't have full-time jobs.  THey have been indefinately detained under the zero fee scam, they are disabled, they are not really looking for work.  They are disqualified.  They are in jail.  They are in hospital.  They are supposedly in polytech or university.  They are living in a  bunker under the ground somewhere.  All voluntary-like.  How many people between the ages of 20 and 65 have full time employment in NZ?  Do you reckon...  15 per cent of them?  Full time jobs?  What would you suppose?  Less than that?  Then how many under the age of 20 and over the age of 65 have paid full time government employment.  Not the private sector.  Government work.  Younger people because you pay them less, obviously.  You don't need to even wash your hands to make a cheese-roll - right Chris?  We can put people to 'work' putting things in and out of the surgical autoclaves (with bits of bone and hair stuck on on the way out) while recording re re re re re enrolment fees from them. </p>

                            <p>'Parent category visa'.  I don't think that could win you votes (from people eligible to vote now).  How does one campaign for election on that?  What democracy?</p>

                            <p>I'd just love to see the work that Shane Reti did for a Physiology Major from Waikato (no such thing) to 'be enough' for entry to MBChB with University of Auckland.  </p>

                            <p>Name a single health outcome that is better for... Shane Reti being given a 2 year certificate in public health from Harvard?  Please upload all the work you provided to Harvard in exchange for your 2 year certificate in Public Health, Shane Reti.  So we can see what you provided to them (if anything at all) in exchange for your qualification.  So that we know what value to place on your qualification (if any).  And, I suppose, what to place on the value of you.  I mean, I'm not sure the country can afford you, anymore.  Please tell the nation what value you place on you.  What is your salary and what has it been every year since you claim to have qualification?  I'm really seriously curious..  All the work that you've done to prevent and prohibit the health the communities you've conned into thinking that somehow you are the only game in town.  F*cking psychopaths...  How do you get to be local representatives of a part of the country that you weren't from, exactly?  Your parents lived in Hamilton and somehow expedited your path to Auckland as a post-graduate of the fine physiology programme that their is at the University of Waikato -- did you say?  You no make sense.  Hey.  No such thing.  Hey.</p>

                            <p>Come, now.  The Harry Harlow inspired Starship children.  The outcomes of the Fisher and Paykal incubator embryo to maturity situation that would mean that the likes of Chris would never need roll up his sleeves or wash his hands to make cheese rolls.  They'd do it until it was time to pay them and then they'd be exterminated or die all voluntary-like of cancer or whatever mental disease.  Suicide themselves all voluntary-like so that Chris and Chris never need to roll up their sleeves of wash their hands or do anything at all, actually.  The breeding programme of motherless 'humans' (so to speak) who would be blow up sex puppets.  What's that John Key?  The great immunisation strategy is to offer people NZD$20 outside a nightclub on a Friday night and they'd do anything anything anything you could possibly desire?  Speaking from experience, no doubt.  Would have things no other way.  The real outputs of the think tank.  Sure.  Of course.  Nobody ever else had a thought worth acknowledging.  Surely.</p>

                            <p>Next thing  you know Chris and Chris will be awarded an honorary degree in food science and expedited through their training programme so they can wear their suits to work to make one cheese roll to proclaim to the world the value they place on chefs.  I mean they could do the job with no training and health and safety be damned!  Roll up all you 15 or was it 12 or was it 2 year old 'studnet's of the world to be re re re re re enrolled in food science qualifications (or disqualifications) requiring how much recorded against your name with the IRD for you to be put to unpaid labor in the name of internship before you are..  Ground up and fed to the animals.  One can only suppose. When it's time for them to pay you.  No doubt.</p>

                            <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/498502/wellington-doctors-told-to-stop-referring-women-to-specialists-unless-their-condition-is-urgent  I would imagine that the waiting list siutation would be comparable to the payroll list information.  I mean to say that various people would be named on lists when they are literally dead, already.  Or, if you asked them whether they knew they were on the list, they would express surprise.  They don't know anything about it.  Various of the other names would be fictional people.  Made up.  Maybe the electricity authority is on the wait list for castration.  That kind of thing.  The charitable trust that is on payroll for millions and millions that doesn't seem to do any actual thing.  I suppose it's a list of 'volunteers'.  That is or means to say 'people who have been volunteered'.  Their names have been pulled out of a hat or out of someone's arse, or similar, or just made up, so they can clutter up the wait lists.  THen you can have 'clinician's who simply interview people on wait lists, all day...  If the people on the wait list are fictitious then that means they just collect up the payroll and don't even need to see any patients at all!  The names of people who have been consented.  Who, if you asked them anything about it (if they even exist) would say that they don't know anything about it, at all.  But they've been consented for emergency urgency surgery.  Apparently or allegedly.  Where are the informed consent forms?  Did you inform the patients, yet, that they've  been elected for their emergency urgency surgery?  Else they will die in..  How mamy months?  Get everybody believing that without their urgency emergency surgery (and maybe even with) they'll  be exterminated in however many months.  So that various other people over the age of 65 can keep on keeping on with their payroll.  TO keep the surgery wait lists all full up of non-consenting 'patients'.  It's not that hard to understand why they will not process applications to enrol and acknowledge progressions through qualifications.  They will not give degrees to people who have done the work for them.  So they can expedite 'people' into positions where they are making up wait-lists of those who have been volunteered and consented by whoever makes up the wait lists.  What a f*cking joke. </p>

                            <p>I mean most of it is just a complete scam.  They were taking people and giving them fake surgeries in the name of arthroscopy.  Minimally invasive surgery.  So minimally invasive that it wasn't actually surgery, at all!  They just gave them the horse tranquiliser and maybe a little cervical or prostate exam so the kiddies playing doctors and nurses got to feel like they were getting their monies worth out of paying and paying and paying for their 'education and training programme' and maybe made a little cut or incision on the side of their knee...  Then invoiced ACC for how many hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars for all the surgeries they were performing.  While they seeded cervical cancers and endometriosis and so on.  One can only suppose.  Helping me,  helping me, helping me, help myself to you.  NOw we understand the function of the ethics exam.  Must have.  </p>

                            <p>Someone said something to me the other day about cranial massage.  Yes, I suppose that makes sense.  before the skull bones have fused.  THe incubator babies hauled out early after telling the mother they would have to take steroids if they were to have a live birth at all.  If they bothered to tell the mother anything or if she was given horse tranquiliser and so on in her state care institution.  They have to implant the pre-embryo's, in most nations of the world.  So the infants have mothers.  It isn't the case that Starship Childrens Hospital Neonatology is literally growing neonates in Fisher and Paykal Incubators.  The Government has custody, do they?  Of these children (if they don't harvest them early so they can do autopsy's on their brains and such).  Measure the amount of white matter.  Scar tissue, mostly, from the cranial stimulation.  THey would say that shaking them and poking at their brains when their brains are merely covered by skin isn't anything any different from what their parents would do, if they were to have parents.  It's culturally appropriate.  See what happens when you squish the brain here and you squish the brain there.  Apply pressure or stimulation.  See the Cerebal Palsies!  See how much money you can get for your hostages!  </p>

                            <p>See how intelligent and good some people are these kinds of lengthst that they go to.  To train the little psychopaths how to interact with everybody right the way up the food chain.  So that one day the likes of Chris or Jacinda get sick.  Or become incapacitated or whatever.  Just think of all the education and training that can be put, then, to fabulous use!  It's sooooo competitive!  It isn't like they are doing anything that others wouldn't be doing to them, if htey had comparable opportunity.  Right?  That's why you have to work reallyr eally hard to undermine and destroy everyone else.  It's not like they aren't doing everything they can to destroy you!  There really doesnt' seem to be anything here...  It's okay.   NObody needs to choose to have a baby.  Various  have  been consented and it's unclear whether they need a uterus at all.</p>

                            <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/498482/courts-clogged-by-self-represented-litigants-lawyers-say-solutions-proposed  The reason the courts are clogged is becuase the judges order 2nd and 3rd and 4th case management conferences ordering things to be re-filed making things more rather than less complicated.  For example, the judge can simply read the law, as wrote, to the 'University' and order them to come back to the courts with a judgment that is, this time, within the law.  But the judges won't do it.  They'll order re re re re filings to delay substantive hearing.  Then they won't find in the interests of justice, at all, to try and force more and more and more filings with the court of appeal.  The clutter is, at least in part, of their own making.  They have opportunity to pronounce simple verdicts on simple matters that are brought before them at least some of the time.  And they will not do it.  Judges deliver judgments late and the judgments are convoluted.  They wax on about if this or that fact was different.  THey aren't supposed to judge hypothetical cases.  They are supposed to judge what has come before them in fact.  Not sure if the problem is their early onset dementia or their refusal to get out once they reach the age of retirement but they won't deliver justice in a timely fashion, at all.  They don't seem interested to deliver justice, at all.  They seem only interested to delay delay delay and cry cry cry for more and more money (in the form of re-filing fees etc).  Making more work for everybody.  I guess that's because they don't have enough to be getting on with.  I mean, think about the kim.com trials as one example.  Will not deport him to stand trial in the US.  How many pages of judgement has been generated while the courts convolute things?  NOt even trying to be fair at all.  Come here, all the criminals of the world!  You will not be extradited to stand trial before foreign courts!  Come here, all the criminals of the world!  You won't need to worry about courts of overseas holding you responsible or accountable for your crimes!  We don't have a functioning judiciary! </p>

                            <p>The judges won't order legal fees to be paid to lawyers.  THey mostly won't order costs to be paid and they certainly don't award legal fees.  They don't award damages.  They reward by finding against.  There could be no evidence submitted before the courts that would attest to.  Choice phrases such as these.  It is a myth that you need a lawyer to succeed in legal filings.  Lawyers don't succeed in legal filings.  THe people who succeed in legal filings are the likes of Jacinda and Ashley who declare unlawful lock-down and the courts can't or won't see anything wrong with that.  They can violate the law with impunity says the law courts of NZ. </p>

                            <p>Jacinda's jaw is looking a little altered.  Photoshopped or maxilo-facial surgery, it is hard to say.  Alteration of the jaw, like that.  Big white even teeth isn't hard.  You just pull them all out and replace them with dentures.  But altering the shape of the mandible, like that...  I think photoshop would probably have been cheaper.</p>

                            <p>Who applies for 3 fellowships with Harvard on the back of a 3 year undergraduate degree from NZL?  I mean, who writes the references for something like that?  She didn't do her Honors year, right?  So she didn't do the equivalent of a 4 year university college degree...  But she was invited to apply to teach at Harvard?  We are supposed to believe?  Is that so they have someone on staff willing to teach the national curriculum of NZ, or something, to the children of the elites in NZ who are expedited to Harvard for their education?  They are creating a stream at Harvard for the NZ kids sent to Harvard?  That would make sense.  It's nothing that NZ wouldn't do...  Making certain degree programmes or streams of certain degree programmes for people who are to be eliminated.  Not really people, I mean to say.</p>

                            <p>Auckland is advertising for people to measure the cranial growth of infants removed early (steroids will induce premature birth) so they can see what nutritional programme results in the most long term deprivation, or similar.  They used to measure 'failure to thrive' by height and weight.  Then they got fancy and started measuring the circumfrence of the cranium.  Now they are specially fancy and wanting people (so to speak) to take scans of their brains and report on that.  I suppose the idea is to implicate as many people (so to speak) as possible in and with that kind of 'research programme' (so to speak).  Harry Harlow had this really interesting research programme (so to speak) on the nature of love.  He designed specialist medical equipment colloqually known as the 'rape rack' and so on so that he could study the  nature of love.  Primate research laboratory.  So to speak.  It's not like what he was doing was anything different from anyting that's been done anywhere else in the world though, right?  And it's inhumane to experiment, like that, on non-human primates in the name of helpling the human children.  We just don't know if melamine or lead or virus infected rabbit liver or feeding infants to infants, even, will have a positive or negative effect on the health of the little children that we just loooove sooooo much.  Wanting to measure the lifetime effects.  I wonder when we give them their medical notes so they can see when the abuses at the hands of the government started, for them.  I suppose they wouldn't have survived their birthing any other way.  Who applies for those kinds of jobs?  I suppose very young people who might be able to plead ignorance or stupidity or something later.  Apparently it's a whole army or circle-jerk of the Glue Factory that is the state of psychiatry.  Only game in town.  WOuld have things no other way.</p>

                            <p>I guess that's what the over 65 year old psychiatrists say about it.  They say that the younger generation are all psychopaths much much much worse than they.  If they have to get out from the payroll then the younger generation will take over.  But they were all handpicked especailly to be psychopaths so that nobody would want the oldest to retire.  They'd want Professor Glue to keep running his Glue Factory once they saw what the only children he'd sign off on planned or wanted to do with it.</p>

                            

                            <p>---</p>

                            <p>When the public health people think that targets are met or progress is made replacing soda with juice-box and cigarettes with vapes is the problem that they are stupid, or that they are evil?  Do they know not what they do, or do they just not care?  Do they not envisage harm or are they trying to promulgate it?  Well...  What happens when people try and suggest that these manouvers are more likely to make problems worse?  Is the problem that they've had their eyes poked out, or is the problem something deeper with their  brains?  Are they genuinely open or interested to find a better way?  Or are they patting themselves on the back for what a wonderful job they are doing, or time that they are having, or some such?</p>

                            <p>Apparently I'm not capable of writing a first year university level essay for public health.  They say they can grade things however they like and I am to be bullied into leaving the 'University' of Auckland because they don't like what it is that I have to say.  They want to keep on taking international student fees for public health degrees marketing that Ashley gets paid half a million dollars per year to declare unlawful lockdown.  Reassuring the world that NZ does not have a functioning judiciary.  The judges refuse to uphold the laws.  I do wonder what became of his sons.  I would imagine that it would be fairly difficult to turn out right when you see how your Father behaves with impunity.  What message does that send for the children?  Ones kept in his home by law during lock-down (apparently anyway) while he left the house most days to go make an appearance on the Bloomfield show for afternoon public health messages.</p>

                            <p>Not even trying, not even a little bit.  Hey.</p>

                            <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/498338/rest-homes-forced-to-sedate-dementia-patients-due-to-lack-of-psychiatrists  Who provides the sedative prescriptions, then?  The vets, when they aren't doing their 'primate research laboratory' experiments on human infants?  </p>

                            <p>It will be interesting to see who they hire for VC of research, University of Waikato.  I see the last one was hired in 2020 and they are looking to replace them, already.  Regression to the mean made it more likely Waikato would rebound in the rankings.  I mean, it couldn't have gone any lower.  Literally. </p>

                            <p>I actually truly and genuinely do not understand why the 'Universities' don't want to acknowledge research output.  If they don't agree with it they can simply acknowledge that it's been done, and otherwise not engage with it.  Else they could actually engage with it and use it as a platform for research of their own.  I genuinely don't understand why they want to be about preventing and prohibiting research from being done.</p>

                            <p>I guess it is about 'there is no alternative'.  They don't want to acknowledge or allow that there were alternatives that were presented.</p>

                            <p>I am disappointed that they didn't interview me for the position.  I think (as I said in my cover letter) that there likely is a lot more research produced from people employed by the university (also by studnets of the university) than they want to acknowledge.  I don't really know what is to be gained by refusing to acknowledge the research that is being done.  The keeping of slaves?  Something like that...  So the aim is oppression and control, then?  Maybe the aim is to keep one of the worst 'universities' in the world.  Is that the plan?  A place for people with no alternative so that they can be treated just horribly.  Is that the grand plan?</p>

                            <p>I don't really understand.  I used to say nice things about my time at Waikato as an undergrad.  There was a lot to like about it.  It's nice to go to a place where the children of the elite don't go.  So you don't have to deal with being expected to bow to them, or whatever.  People were there because they wanted to be there.  Not because of parental expectation or whatever.  People were interesting to talk to.  The academics seemed to care about their teaching.  </p>

                            <p>Then you get to doing research and everything changes.  They try and overload you with low to no paid teaching work and start saying 'garbage garbage garbage rubbish rubbish' about your research output.  Apparently this is because it's soooo competitive with the competitive research funding and so on the supervisors see the students as direct competition and they are interested to elminate them only.  Unless they are dependent on them, of course.  Such that they never have to worry about them working independently, or similar.</p>

                            <p>The 'Universities' of Australasia aren't getting students research work out for external examination.  They are refusing to allow external examiners to sign off on completion of research qualifiations (only if the external examiners believe the research is of high enough quality for the qualification).  They just won't do it.  They are full of excuses about why they won't do it.  The work was too early.  Then the work was too late.  They don't want it externally examined because they have made up their minds internally.  The student didn't house-sit for the supervisor enough.  The studnet did too much house-sitting for the supervisor.  The student didn't go away on enough camping trips.  It's just a f*cking hoax of a f*cking scummy scam is what it is.</p>

                            <p>I can put my research up on this website, however.  Research that was done despite or in spite of (and certainly not because of) people on payroll to supervise me.  The 'Universities' take money from the government to keep me enrolled...  Not just me.  Various other people I could name as well.  People who are producing and who are productive.  Often the people who are producing the most and who are the most productive in fact.  Ones they decide to take and take and take and take the work of without acknowledging, without allowing sign off etc.  Because it's soooo competitive, apparently.  There will be a job for them only over their dead bodies, or something.</p>

                            <p>I can post the research here.  </p>

                            <p>My first research article was on Daniel Dennett's model of personal identity and his model of what was going on in dissociative identity disorder (formerly multiple personality disorder).  I said that there was a tension, here, and I tried to resolve that by being more realist about alters.  This was considered a 'good enough' writing sample for me to be granted funding for an ANU summer research scholarship.</p>

                            <p>My summer research articulated a Wittgenstinean / narrative model of delusions along the lines of Sass (a US clinician).  It was a different model from the one Martin Davies was funded for (a model of delusions as irrationality).  I felt it was more sensitive to clinical practice from clinicians who were providing narrative therapy to people and it was also more humane to sufferers.  This was considered 'good enough' for me to be granted funding for a PhD with the Australian National University.  Not good enough for Professor Davies to write me a reference to do a PhD at any University -- but good enough for Professor Davies to say he would 'put in a good word for you' if I applied to the ANU. </p>

                            <p>My honors year allowed me to write 2 more research articles.  One of them developed or extended the model of dissociative identity disorder to find a middle path or middle ground between the two different treatment options that were offered overseas.  They considered themselves to be rivals. I showed a middle way.  The other of them focussed more on an articulation of the metaphysics of alters or the status of the self.  It was a development of Dennett's model on personal identity.</p>

                            <p>I also wrote a Masters thesis (up to 50,000 words) for Waikato.  I further developed and extended a model of delusions and showed theoretical foundation or basis for how Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (which had only just been introduced in the Waikato region) could be used as a treatment for people with delusions or schizophrenic subjects.  This is novel because the 'party line' was that these subjects could only be treated with pharmaceuticals.  I was offering a theoretical justification or grounding or basis for the humane, person-level, psychological or narrative or talk therapy based treatment of people with these conditions.  To the best of my knowledge this was the first that NZ had heard or considered about how psychologists or narrative therapists or psychiatrists could treat patients by offering talk therapy.  DBT provided a highly structured approach to the talk therapy that could be rolled out.  This was a population that was previously regarded as untreatable.</p>

                            <p>When I started at the ANU it was on the basis of a research proposal that I wrote on emotions.  I started reading a literature on the topic.  I was told that my research on delusions was perhaps a chapter of a doctoral thesis.  I don't really know how that math was supposed to work out since I'd done a 50,000 word thesis on the subject.  I'd also done 2 research articles on the subject.  One offering a solution to the problem of the unwanted prediction that Professor Martin Davies had articulated as a problem.  The other an articulation of the humane or person centred understanding of the content of delusional utterances.  I mean to say, I was getting pretty close to having done a doctoral thesis worth of work on the subject of delusions and their treatment within education / psychology / psychiatry.   </p>

                            <p>Anyway, you can see work I did in 2007 and 2008.  A series of talks.  I would write the talks in advance.  They were structured talks.  It wouldnt' be thath hard to turn them from structured talks like that to an entire book of collected talks.  Mostly I was focussed on trying to understand the classification of psychiatric disorders (the DSM) and getting clearer on whether the borders or boundaries between social work, education, psychology, psychiatry etc were more nominal (in name only) than real.  Or whether there was something specially different about the people or conditions treated by psychiatrists.  Also compared to neurology or brain surgery patients.  I sort of floundered with this.  I suppose I mean to say that if there was a difference I couldnt' really find it or articulate it.  The best theory that we had on offer 'the two-stage view' of scientific aspect and evaluative aspect didn't seem to work out.</p>

                            <p>A doctoral thesis is supposed to be up to 100,000 words and produced over 3 to 4 years.  Allowing a year for external examination where external examiners ask questions publically and there is a public defence.  Only, the 'Universities' of Australasia are increasingly refusing to get studnets work out for external examination and refusing to schedule oral defences.  Even in the day and age of AV technology they won't schedule a public oral defence.  Some candidates are scuttled through quickly while their supervisors won't allow externals to ask questions of their pets.  They defend their pets.  Other candidates don't have their work sent out for external examination at all.  The supervisors just keep taking and taking and taking their work.  What do they do with it?  I'm not sure.  I think in at least some cases they give it away to others to plagarise from or keep as their own.  Else maybe it just is about quashing it and pretending it doesn't exist so that they are the only game in town.</p>

                            <p>I suppose that I did not think about 'gaslighting' specifically.  That is when you basically use the model or type or style of talk therapy that could help delusional subjects articulate what is going on and actually help them..  You use those psychological techniques or strategies to try and write people up as being delusional.  Because of politics.  You want to have everybody believe they are crazy.  So you can take their assets for yourself.  So you can refuse to pay them.  For whatever reason.  You tell them up is down and in is out.  You tell them that it's not cold.  You deny reality and replace it with a system or stream of lies.  You tell a studnet that they 'haven't done enough' for a 120 point 1 EFT MPhil when the Tertiary Education Commission says that that is composed of 34 weeks work only.  Then you tell them that they are too slow because you never sent their work out in time.  And so on.</p>

                            <p>I wasn't too bothered when the ANU didn't get my work out, and so on.  I can provide it here.  That's the evidence that I did the work.  You would have to ask the University Administration and Kim Sterelny why it didn't go out to externals for an oral defence and so on.  I think it was  because they got more and more money from the government for keeping me enrolled.  And because Sterelny liked to say that I had to go away on camping trips and I had to housesit for him when he went away on family trips because it was important for my career etc.  Just garbage.  He's not a very nice man.  Not professional.  He's supposed to be my supervisor.  When did he invite or instruct me to meet with him?  When?  Once?  Twice?  After my being enrolled for 2 years?  Where are the written comments he has on the work that I emailed him?  Is there any evidence that he read it?  My studnet notes say (at one point) that the University department thinks I've only got 3 months more work to go before it's done.  Nobody told me that. Nobody got my work out to externals 3 months later.  What do they pay them for?</p>

                            <p>I came back to NZL thinking it wouldn't be too difficult to get entry to study MBChB.  I thought it wouldn't  be too difficult because (1)  It was supposed to be competitive entry on the basis of full-time GPA and I knew that mine was very high (somewhere between an A and an A+).  (2)  I could apply a few different times.  So, if there are around 3x as many applicants as there are the number of places, things simply aren't that competitive, really, when you consider that an applicant might apply a total of 4 or even 6 times over the course of a few years.  (3)  I was told that mature candidates tended to interview better than younger candidates and I was told that they actually wanted people who had background in things like ethics or arts etc.  I thought I was an ideal candidate, really, for something like psychiatry.  I was also willing to show them that I was interested in the more scientific aspects of medicine (e.g., surgery, radiology, pathology) in case there were concerns about someone being too focussed on psychiatry on the way in.</p>

                            <p>It was genuinely surprising / shocking to me the lengths that NZ 'Universities' went to to remove my application from the applicant pool in order to expedite selection for other canadidates.  The  best sense I can make of this is corruption.  The University of Queensland prompted a report to be written around the issue of the VC's daughter being enrolled in Medicine with Queensland when she was not rank ordered high enough for a place.  University staff complained about her having been enrolled in the qualification so an inquiry was done into how they were selecting studnets for enrolment in that qualification.  They found that the VC was at fault for asking employees if there was 'anything they could do' about her not being offered enrolment in the qualification and him not investigating and putting things right when he found out she had  been enrolled in it.  He voluntarily resigned over it.  He was not removed from office.  She was not removed from the programme.  I'm not sure if he paid a bribe or what for her to be subsequently graduated.  I'm not sure if she was ever employed ot work as a medical doctor.  I'm not sure if he paid a bribe or something for her to be enrolled in specialist training.  I'm not sure how many of her patients have suffered wrongful death or medical misadventure at or by her hands.  I don't think that they looked into whose place she stole and I don't think that the student whose place she stole was offered any reparation at all.</p>

                            <p>It was shortly after this that Chris Whelan was employed to process complaints of serious wrong-doing about NZ Universities.  He was employed and paid several hundred thousand dollars per year as head of the NZVCC to process complaints of serious wrong-doing.  He has used the position to collect up complaints that have been made by both studnets and staff about NZ universities.  What has he done with the complaints?  He says that none of them constitute complaints of 'serious wrongdoing'.  Rather, they are just 'personal problems' the complainant has.  He has refused to collect up evidence around the complaint and he has refused to forward that evidence to police so that they may prosecute wrong-doing.  They will not do it.  </p>

                            <p>The University of Auckland told me that I was not 'eligible' to apply to be enrolled in Medicine.  But this is false. I am over the age of 20 so the education and training act says that I am eligible in fact.  They told me that I was required to complete a new programme of study for the purposes of eligibility, however.  I asked specifically if a 120 point MPhil from Waikato would be enough for them to regard me to be eligible.  THey said that it would.  That since the MPhil was an ungraded qualification they would use the full-time GPA from my previous study.  I wrote, then, a 120 point MPhil for the University of Waikato.  I was writing it at the time when the University of Auckland was supposed to be processing my application for Medicine.  Firstly they refused to offer me an interview time.  They said that I wasn't eligible for interview. I pointed out that none of the first year studnets they were interviewing were eligible for interview.  They were refusing to interview students who were eligible (by statute) and were interviewing students who hadn't even completed 1 year of university study.  They ended up interviewing me then they told me my rank order score was not high enough for offer of place.  I called b*llsh*it on that.  They showed me how they miscalaculated my GPA.  I provided calculations in accordance with how their policy says they will calculate it.  They then said my GPA didn't matter because I wasn't eligible.  THey simply will not process the applications properly for Medicine.  I can only assume that it's because of corrruption.  I suppose that the bulk if not all of the people they enrol in that qualification are not eligible to be enrolled in that qualification.  </p>

                            <p>I suppose it's genuinely difficult all the work they do to ensure that Dr Leeks is the only game in town.  </p>

                            <p>Corruption.  It seems to be. Not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                            <p>Neil Quigley told me to take them to court.  The University of Waikato wouldn't get my thesis out to externals.  Then they sent it out requesting it be examined for a qualification I wasn't even enrolled in.  Just garbage garbage output from the 'university'.  Just will not do it.  Will not have a research output.  Won't even process applications to enrol etc.</p>

                            <p>We don't really have to wonder why we don't have a functioning health system etc.  Corruption.  They will have things no other way.</p>

                            <p>I was genuinely surprised the lengths they went to.  Pulling Judges out of retirement and reappointing them as Judges (that is not the proper process for how Judges are appointed).  They wrote that they couldnt see anything wrong.  It was like they had their eyes poked out.  Not capable of parsing a statute.  Not willing to uphold the laws.  Just won't do it.  NZ does not appear to have a functioning Judiciary.  I was genuinely surprised the lengths that they went to.  The Supreme Court doesn't see anything wrong.  NZ is happy enough to declare that not only does it not have a health system but it also doesnt' have a functioning education system or judiciary.  I mean...  What's left?  Is it a democratic nation at all?  Not even trying to be..  There is no alternative...  What social services?  Not even trying to be fair, at all... </p>

                            <p>I wonder what the plan is, sometimes.  Khan academy does not have a very well developed social policy or sociology or whatever curriculum.  They want to say that the evils of the world are the result of disorganisation which is the absense of organisation.  But that doesn't seem right to me.  I don't see evidence of people not doing their work, say.  What I see evidence of is corruption.  It isn't an absense or lack of organisation, or whatever.  There is a genuine intent.  A force, if you will.  Malevolent intent.  Why?  I guess it's to keep the money out.  I guess it's about how badly things need to be kept in the Stanford Prison Experiment-Land that is NZL (that's the reason for arbitrarily assigning people a social class to be rulers of the harem or one of those kept dependent) so that people will keep handing over USD $80 x 8 ivy league schools (or similar) for 'application processing'.  But why would anybody think they are actually processing the applications?  Go figure.  Harvard is inviting Jacinda Arden to all voluntarily walk away from being elected leader of NZ in exhange for...  How much money was it?  One million over the next 10 or was that 20 or 40 years?  To tell the graduates of Harvard Medical School that nobody would be prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus in NZ (e.g., from all the knock-out baby gene studies) and nobody ever was prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus even when abortion was listed in the crimes act nobody was prosecuted when we had about the highest rate of aborted foetus' in the world...</p>

                            <p>I guess it's the warmongering thing that they do.  MIT manufacture or weapons.  Harvard manufacture of reasons to use them.  Taken over by psychopaths.  Not even trying to be fair.  Nasty.  Real nasty.  What people do you see, over there?  We are really supposed to believe that Harvard is paying for Jacinda's security detail, now, and paying for people to manage her Tweets etc?  I don't think so...  Garbage output.  Garbage garbage garbage.  By design.</p>

                            <p>I guess they are just being increasingly honest about it.  The 'students' trafficked here.  Whatever  happened about the one from China who was raped in her res hall in the 5th year of her 5 year double-degree so she could be hospitalised in the Grafton campus then deported for breech of visa conditions?  Auckland University said they would not re-enrol her and allow her to complete her Degrees.  After she paid how much in international student fees?  After she paid for the entire programme?  NZ seems willing to say 'yes, that's what we are.  That's how we do'.  And the world goes 'whatever'.  Right.  So what sense do we make, then, of the government pretending to hire lawyers and so on, when they don't have judges who will uphold the law.  I mean...  They aren't even pretending to have a functioning judiciary.  If kim.com wasn't paying and paying and paying the courts for NZ to be proclaimed the unlawful detetion camp of the world..  I mean..  We won't extradite him to stand trial in the US. He stays in NZ while he waits for a trial..  He'll die before he stands before a judge in the US.  Right?  So the world just sends all the criminals here.  And however many children they can get away with culling, or whatever.  How would it have been worse for the Uni of Auckland to have done the right thing by that girl?  But they chose to pronounce their corruption.  I guess they are advertising to the world for the criminals to come here and do anything anything to the syphilitic unborn babies or whatever.  It doesn't make any sense to me.  I suppose someone or other gets off on that.</p>

                            <p>Oh, that's right.  It's supposed to be about the normalisation of psychopathy.  That's how come the psychologists could do their research on psychopathy on the first year management studnets, or whatever.  I guess the idea was to only graduate those of them who were the biggest psychopaths, or similar.  Then have everybody believe (rightly if they can get away with it) that psychopathy is the only alternative.  That the people who weren't psychopaths were eliminated long ago.  They lost, they were removed, and the psychopaths only remained.  It's like the wrong people won the war in this part of the world.  We can tell that that is so -- because the atrocities never stopped.  There is no will to stop them.  There is only 'there is no alternative' and 'we don't see anything wrong -- it isn't like what is happening is any different from anything else that is happening'.  There was no other game in town.</p>

                            <p>And then people just keep their mouths shut and keep their heads down.  That's what the Nazi's did -- right?  They just followed orders.  And whistled quietly to themselves happy happy songs whilst marching people off to the death chambers.  They said they were just following orders.  With joy in their hearts.  At least they don't need to keep quiet, now, the very best of us.  The winners.</p>

                            <p>It's not any differnet that Jacinda was pulled out by the US just before the election near the end of her second term.  Same thing happend with JOhn Key.  He was pulled out  by the US to Hawaii.  Who knows where they went to, really, if it was a prison camp or what.  If they were held to account for their crimes.  I guess the idea is for there to be enough ambiguity to placate everone.  Until they take better control of the water, or similar.</p>

                            <p>So the ideal is for people to keep their heads down and their mouths shut...  So that NZL can grow it's business and traffick more and more and more and more and more and more to the death camps?  Is that the plan?  We count the arrivals, apparently, but we don't count how many never make it out, alive.  I guess there's that.  Apparently farce-book is supposed to be some kind of social insurance.  Right.  Because people are indistinguishable from a bot telling the world that everything is okay and they've voluntariliy decided to stay in NZ indefinately and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay all their monies to Harvard.  Yeah, right. </p>

                            <p>I guess it makes sense, intellectually, how the aim or the goal or the purpose or  the point is to kill and harm and maim and destroy.  Bully and abuse.  All of that.  That makes sense of the use to which they put the research that is done.  They only pretend to care about helping because they can put the information to use harming.  For example, if they learn that they can set people up for a lifetime of poverty and deprivation and so on by arranging for them to be abused early in life...  Then they will invest in arranging for them to be abused early in life.  If they can get the pipeline going.  That's the plan, right?  To eliminate people entirely.  Just replace them with primates who do what they are told when they are told because they are told.  Blow up dolls rather than people.  Ones who run on the smell of an oily rag or something.  What people?  </p>

                            <p>Apparently Chris and Chris didn't appreciate the value of the trades, or something.  So now they are setting about ensuring that people are kept re re re re re enrolled in trade programmes where they can put them to work in the name of unpaid internship while recording increasing levels of debt against their name.  They will never sign off on them having completed the progamme - because then they might have to pay them and they won't pay them!  When it is time to pay them it is time for them to go away.  Disappear.  They were indistinguishable from a Twitter Bot anyway -- right?  Just roll out a marketing campaign trying to lure people to move to NZ so they can pay and pay and pay and pay and pay some visa processing fees.  We will not have things any other way.</p>

                            <p>Apparently it's to drive up the cost of Cambridge Curriculum, or something.  Each iteration of how much worse they can make the national curriculum, by design.  The statutory law says that domestic teenagers are entitled to a free secondary education until they turn 20.  So, of course, they target them for enrolment in university programmes of study where they record levels of debt against their name.  Spit them out of the 'university' after...  1 year of university level education, was it?  The US embassy will say a standard undergraduate degree from a NZ university is equivalent to 2 years of university level education, will they?  That's a costly 'education'.  Fatal, in fact.  Wouldn't you say?  Not even trying to be fair, hey.</p>

                            <p>It's interesting the use to which they put information that a person actually is a pedophile or a bully and abuser of children.  Those are ones who they expedite for registration to work with children.  Over and over and over we hear of these cases.  Everybody knows it to be so.  Every school has their pedophile on staff -- don't they?  At least one.  And they write them glowing references and they are most desirable hires.  They make sure they get payrolled.  Even when they are fresh out of prison and they didn't even do teacher training.  They are still most highly valued.  Expedited into position.  Same for medicine and so on.  The ones who are most valued.  There's really nothing here, hey.</p>

                            <p>So they get retired judges (I think they were) to write reports on the abuse in state care.  To ensure that they don't name any of their cronies as being perpetrators, one can only suppose.  Strange  how the over 65 year olds are both too old and incompetent and demented to be held accountable for their crimes but also kept on the payrolls.  Most valuable.  Most valued.  Will have things no other way.  F*cking farce, hey.  They want to say it's about population control or something.  Lists of people who are or were to be targeted by pedophiles and bullies and so on.  Why?  So they gnaw each others arms off, or something.  Gnaw their own arms off.  Suicide all voluntary-like or else express things so that when the government suicides them not to voluntary-like everybody concludes that they must have done it to themselves.  That's how NZ has such high rates of suicide and 'suicide' all voluntary-like the people who were volnteered.  When it was time to pay them, strangely enough.  SO that there would be more money for Ashley snockums darling so he could continue on his good works marketing public health degrees to international students and they would pay and pay and pay for visa processing, one can only suppose, so they can be raped in their residential halls and thrown in a psych institution when it's time to graduate them.</p>

                            <p>F*cking psychopaths.  For sure.</p>

                            <p>Work hard in your Cambridge Curriculum everybody!  Don't forget to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for special private tutors will provide the answers.  Don't forget to attach photos of the pretty little little children on their application for enrolment and hand the pretty little children over to be abused of the pedophiles of Harvard or Oxford etc etc then.  So they can hand over however many years of work before being deported without their qualifications.  After however many years of hearing how they are garbage garbage garbage rubbish rubbish by the only pedophiles bullies and abusers they'd payroll.  Often people who aren't involved in research themselves.  People payrolled ot prevent and prohibit the research of others, that's for sure.  What a f*cking farce of a hoax of a scummy f*cking scam.  Have I done enough work for a 3 EFT PhD from Australasia do you suppose?  How many years was that supposed to take, again?  It was all A's right the way through my undergraduate years.  First in Class for Law and Society.  A for Medsci142.  A for cell biology.  Nobody has a problem with my work.  30 per cent for public health.  The problem of evil, wouldn't you say?  Bullied into leaving the 'university'.  There isn't a Medical School in NZ.  I don't suppose there is in Australia either.  I don't suppose there is in the USA either, to be fair.  There's nothing there.  Why would anybody help another person?  It just doesn't make any sense at all.  There's nothing there, hey.</p>

                            <p>The Medical Doctors can't really strike -- or people will notice or realise that we don't have any.  Don't miss them.  Can't miss them.  There's nothing there.  How many of them are over 65?  How many of them are over 50?  They can't train students in our 'hospitals' -- because they aren't hospitals.  They are prison or detention camps.  It's where we put the play school 'students' who are supposed to be enrolled in secondary school, still.  They are put to work playing doctors and nurses so the 'professors' can have an excuse to publically fondle them etc etc.  Put them to 'work experience' (so to speak) doing prostate exams and cervical exams on unconsenting nonconsenting anesthetised patients.  Hey, I pushed the scope so far up I could see the ovary!  Likely pushing endometrial cells with and maybe even perforating the fallopian tubes so as to grow the important business of sickness and disease and suffering and pain...  F*cking psychopaths.  Don't worry -- it's not like they graduate them.  Can replace them with new students who will pay and pay and pay and pay the 'university' for more 'education and training' and just take the pretty ones and throw them away once you're done having your fun with them.  F*cking psychopaths.  There's nothign there.  Hey.</p>
