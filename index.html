 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">

                            <p>University of Canterbury can fire people for subcontracting out a lecture.  Lots of academics have done that, so that's a lot of potential firings.  I'm surprised that the court didn't say that they should have explained to her that she was not to do that and told her not to do it again.  Sent a memo out to all the university employees and tell them that they were not to subcontract their work or get their students doing their research and / or teaching work for them for less pay.  I would have thought that before you fired someone over something you were supposed to tell them that something was not acceptable and give them opportunity to remedey that.  But the courts of NZ have ruled that if you find that your employee has done something like that then you can fire them.  So, I wonder how many people will be fired from NZ 'Universities' now.</p>

                            <p>They fired someone who actually produced a research output of a sort.  A play.  Wrote a new play.  I would imagine or suppose that the rest of the English department would have been sooooooooooo jealous that one of the people in the department had produced a research output.  Soooooooooo jealous.  Oh my!  They would have got together for a right tongue wag!   The play would have been garbage garbage garbage rubbish rubbish would have been the verdict from all the unproductive frienemies.  Nasty.  Vindictive.  Spiteful.  Mean.  That's the way of universities when the lack of production of research output becomes the norm.  The most unproductive are often the meanest when it comes to undermining the outputs of others.  Because it's sooooooooo competitive.  </p>

                            <p>THey probably fired the most productive person in the English Department.  So they can get back, then, to business as usual, where they eye each other wariliy and call 'garbage garbage' until nobody outputs any work at all.  The race to the bottom.</p>

                            <p>It wasn't very nice of me to call my frienemies 'f*cking retards'.  But then, it was not very nice of them not to get my work out for external examination.  I'm trying to remember if I was ever nasty or mean or whatever about their work.  I'm wondering why they think it is acceptable for them to  be nasty about or over mine?  I see now that it was about my not applying for jobs that they were applying to so that they would be the only game in town.  I'm not surprised Kim Sterelny wanted to keep Rachel close -- wasn't Rachel's husband privately tutoring his daughter in math?  I guess Kim would have wanted to make sure that the got the school grades that she needed to do whatever he wanted her to be enrolled in in University.  That makes sense.  Why he would have been keen to have Rachel and Rachel's husband kept around.  Why didn't my work go out to externals Rachel?  How about your work..  Did your work ever go out to externals?  Did you get reports from external examiners who were independent enough from Sterelny and the production of your research for them to be independent?  I wonder because I remember Nick saying that his externals didn't have so much as a typographical alteration for him to make.  THey just accepted his thesis without any changes at all.  Which, more recently, I've thought is most likely to be the case when...   Why, when the Univesrity simply says that they sent it out to examiners and simply says that they didn't have any changes.  I mean to say...  Who externally examines a thesis and doesn't find so much as a sentance that can be restructured?  A single typo to be corrected?  Another reference to be added?  It just doesn't sound plausible to me at all that someone be paid however much to externally examine a thesis and then..  Not write examiners reports of that thesis, at all.  It sounds to me like it was not sent out for external examination.  They just gave him the Degree.</p>

                            <p>Nasty business.  Nasty business, indeed.  You are right Sterelny.  Australasia does not have an education and training system, at all.  There's nothing there.  It got overtaken by the likes of you.  F*cking psychopaths.  </p>

                            <p>Who does your house-sitting now, Kim?  Carl still doing that while he writes a PhD thesis 2x (or did you write his second one for him or reapprporiate it from someone else and have Carl pass that one off as his own else he would never never never be acknowledged as having done enough for a PhD)..  What happened to Carl's thesis on personal identity that he wrote in the first 3 years?  Someone from Princeton was credited as the author of it -- right?  So that you could bully Carl and try and have everyone believe he was slow and unproductive and a procrastinator etc etc while you refuse to accept that he'd done all of the work that he's done and you get him housesitting for you and you claim how much money over how many decades to keep Carl enrolled in the Univesrity?  F*cking psychopath.  </p>

                            <p>Overloading the graduate students with teaching work was a main way that the Universities have of bullying graduate students into taking more and more and more time to have their research work acknowledged.  The other main mechanism is telling them that they are garbage garbage garbage.  I wish, retrospectively, that I actually tape-recorded the supervision meetings that I had with Justine Kingsbury.  So that people could hear how she spoke to me.  The tone and manner that she used.  She would instruct me to make a change to my thesis that would make it more  her and less me and it was a change that I didn't want to make for various reasons.  Then I'd have to explain to her why I thought that the change she was suggesting would make the thesis worse and less likely to be accepted by externals than it was at present.  But  no.  She was determined I should change it in ways that were different from what the externals required.  And she was determined that she was the authority on what the externals meant in their comments to me and that I was to do what she said else I would be failed for the Degree.  While she insructs me to change in in ways the externals never asked for.  Doing everything she can to have me failed, herself.  Nasty nasty nasty.  Why?  Jealousy.  Spite.  Those kinds of things...  That seems to be it.  She has a tenured position on payroll as a philsophy academic.  I did everything I could to soothe her that I wasn't going to be applying for philosophy jobs.  I was going to get the thesis done and then go off and do something else.  Something that was different from what she wanted to do.  So I wasn't a direct competitor with her...  In fact, I was happy for us to get sections to journal and then she could get some credit as co-author and it would be good for her to have publication.  Right?  Instead of her working to undermine the work I'd already done let's get sections out to journals.  Let the editors tell us what needs to happen and get the minimum that they say done quickly quickly quickly for fast turnaround. There is no f*cking reason to get stuck working for deacades going over and over and over and over and over and over the same.  Get it done.  Move on.  Move forwards.  If other people want to spend the next however many years bickering about it then let them do that.  No reason to get f*cking stuck in the f*cking swamp.  1 year of research done in 1 year.  Why is that so f*cking impossible in this f*cking sh*t hole?  What University?  Where is your research output, Justine?  What is the output of the Philosophy Programme?  5,000 words per person per year?  So maybe 1 article each every 2 years?  1 article each every 5 years?  How could you guys possibly work so f*cking slow?</p>

                            <p>Because it's about keeping the bums on the seats in the slave prison detention camp.  Recording ever increasing levels of debt against people's name.  While the government cry cry cry cry cries about how there aren't any skilled workers and they can't employ anybody to work on the UN declaration on human rights.  The only people they graduated from the Universities have been spending the last 6 months unpacking their bags and they haven't started any work, yet.  The Universities wouldn't enrol, wouldn't acknowledge progression through training, wouldn't graduate anybody else.  Must be the breeding of gamma babies in NZ.  The best and the brightest have been spending the last 10 f*cking years trying to find their pencils and they haven't even started work,  yet.  It's the f*cking gamma baby land down here, all right.  Chris Whelan takes hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to go blackbirding for victims to be recorded as re re re re re re re re enrolled in NZ universities.  He says he's so overwhelmed by all of the complaints of wrongdoing about NZ Universities that he receives that he can't process a single complaint!  He says they are not actually complaints of wrongdoing. All of the complaints are about personal problems. It's all very very very very personal against the student.  It's just a person problem against the studnet and there's nothing at all wrong with NZ Universities targeting students on entirely personal grounds.  How do you commit a genocide Chris Whelan?  One by one by one by one by one.  There's nothing about a 'group of people' being targeted.  COurse not.  You just go after as many as you can all opportunistically on entirely personal grounds.  Take another hundred thousand for you, Chris, call it a bonus for the personal targeting of Mason Pendrous.  Justice Toogood (injustice Toogood) didn't think that you could pinpoint his time of death on the basis of when he stopped using his internet.  Didn't think that they should take a look at the security camera footage of the public areas of his hall to see who was last seen leaving his room, even.  What University?   What Judiciary?  </p>
