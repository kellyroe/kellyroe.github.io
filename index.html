                            <article>
  

    <p>'One of the issues which has been identified by the network is that the NCEA results in rural areas are limiting the pool of prospective students'.  https://www.odt.co.nz/opinion/editorial/rural-gp-training-proposal-welcome 
    </p>

    <p> They are throwing away applications, and then crying about how they don't have enough.  The Education and Training Act states that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible to be enrolled in the programme they have applied for.  But they throw their applications away because they want wide eyed teenagers who will do anything anything anything before tossing them away.
    </p>

    <p>
    They are refusing to train a new generation of GPs because new GPs will get a job only over the dead bodies of the old GPs and the old GPs have no intention of dying for the next 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 or 100 years and so they have no intention of training new GPs.  I mean, why would anybody voluntariliy choose to give up their payroll?  It doesn't make any sense.  And why would they sign off on completion of training from someone who might be paid instead of them.  WHy would they set themselves up for potentially having less money.  It doesn't make any sense.
    </p>

    <p>Rinse and repeat for everything else.  We don't have any teachers, nurses, lawyers, judges, police, plumbers, electricians.  It's soooooo competitive.  Nobody applies to do those things.  Nobody graduates from those qualifications.  Nobody applies for those jobs.   Nobody is on payroll to work those jobs.  Just a  bunch of 60 or 70 or 80 year olds on 3x or 4x the payroll while they take the 'work' outputs of the younger ones (who pay the university who pay the university who pay the university who pay who pay who pay for their 'training')...  All the ones kept on government welfare (less than minimum wage)...  Take all the 'work' outputs until the day that they die.  Apparently it's sooooooooo competitive.  There will be a job for me only over however many dead bodies.  Waiting waiting waiting for the bodies to die.  Allllll the payroll for them.  ALlllll the payroll for them.  ALlllll the payroll for them.  Allll of the payroll for them.</p> 

    <p>The courts have ruled that the universities don't have to examine studnets work.  They don't have to get their work to externals.  They don't have to give students qualifiations when they have done the work for them.  The secondary schools don't have to either.  I mean, it doesn't matter how well you score in your NCEA examinations if your teachers want to collect up more and more and more money for keeping you enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled then they don't have to pass you.  Why would they pass you?  Why wouldn't they pass all and only the ones who cannot function independently.  That's a great idea.  That way they can be sure that they are the only ones on payroll.  All of the payroll for them.  All of the payroll for them.  But what payroll?  Australian Payroll no work for New Zealand teachers.  Australian Payroll  no work.  Keeping of slaves...  The Univesrities are blatently functioning as slave prison or detention camps.  They aren't employing people willing and able to do research.  They are intentionally employing people who are unwilling and or unable to do research.  They knowingly put people on payroll with the intent that they will refuse to graduate students so as to keep slaves hostages prisoners.  There's nothing in Australasia.  Unless you want to be a slaver.  Prison guard.  Keeper of hostages.  Micro-manage other people's work me-wards only for allll of the payroll nd alll of the credit for you.  That's how come they can re-deploy people so easily..  There is no difference.  It's all the same.  The keeping of hostages and slaves.  Train in one thing and get less payroll for doing something different entirely.  Qualifications not acknowledged anymore . Only given in the first place because they never would be.  ALl of the honorary degrees only that don't mean anything at all.  There's nothing to see...  It doesn't matter what the laws are because the courts refuse to uphold the laws.  THey won't write fair examination scripts or even if they do they won't fairly examine the work tkhat has been done.  They won't blind grade work on it's academic merits.  ALl the energy and effort and time and expense that goes into the keeping of slaves.  The lowest value economy in the world.  By design.  The leaders seem determined to keep it so.  The courts seem to think their job or role is to compound injustices only.  There's nothing here.</p>

    <p>How many old people do we want in rural communities?  Well, then.  Just put a bunch of murdering pedophile psychopaths out there as community leaders and let them gnaw each other to death.  Problem solved.  Then we can declare theis land terra nullus and everywhere else lin teh world can send their undesirables here.  Teh arse end of nowhere.  Nothing here.  All of the medical experiments can be done on the peple down here.  It's sooooooo competitive.  Soooooooo competitive.  Sooooooo competitive.  How many FTE's was Ailsa Claire, again?  MOre than half  million to do what?  To keep hostages and cry cry cry cry cry to the government for more money.  How many FTE's was the VC of the University of Auclkand?  More than half a million to do what?  To keep hostages and cry cry cry cry cry to the government for more money.   How many FTE's was Una Jagose again?  NOtice a common theme here?  HOw many people 'don't count' for the purposes of rates of unemployment?  How many people are actully paid to work full time jobs in New Zealand?  There is really nothing here...  I guess they will be paying people in bitcoin soon.  Because states aren't allowed to print their own money / mint their own coin.  But, of course, the NZ dollar is ordered to be printed by Australia, I belive.  To disguise and conceal that they don't pay New Zealanders Australian wages.  Keeping people gnawing each other to death over scraps.  Wasteland.  Indeed.  But the worst of it is the energy and effort nd time nd expense that goes into ensuring that  this is so and this is how it must remain.  No hint of 'try'.  No good deed goes unpunished in these lands.</p>

    <p>The courts are still refusing to pay compensation to the victims of Dr Leeks.  Meanwhile they are deliberating on whether another child should be given to other Medical 'Professionals' to do whatever they want with for a weekend (open heart surgery with blood units and plasma from Australia) before he is given back to his parents.  That's convenient.  The courts and the government can simply mandate that people are required to follow orders or instructions in these parts.  There is already no opt off from record sharing systems.  That way they can get teh important research data out, you see.  From all the medical experiments that are being done on people in these parts.  That's presumably how come we only 'treat' the involuntary.  Non-voluntary.  Non-consenting.  There's nothing here.  They won't train a workforce.  But they also won't get out of the way when people do learn how to do things in spite of and despite of them.  NOt because of them because why would someone voluntarily choose to walk away from however much money.  There's nothing in these parts.  Party party party lets have a party lets muster up the biggest mob to take to take to take.  There's nothing here.</p>

    <p>People know Kim Sterelny. They know what kind of person he is.  The world is very hostile and it's sooooooo competitive.  All the thinking is driven by people trying to gnaw each other's arms off.  It's soooooo surprising that there is anything anything anything at all.  These are the stories they looooove to here.  Allll of the research funding for him and the hostile world that he is building that makes them feel like they are such successes at and in life.  It's all soooooooo competitive.  People know what he's like inter-personally.  'You f*cked the dog' and 'f*cking c*nt' and so on and so forth.  But he's jokey jokey and so it's okay.  Most highly esteemed on payroll.  All of the payroll for him.  Alll of the payroll for him.  ALlll of the payroll for him.  Or, let's see...  Professor Martin Davies.  He got a couple  hundred thousand dollars ARC grant to work on delusions.  I got paid to do a summer scholarship and give a department talk.  I did the work I was paid to do over the summer.  Martin Davies then refuses to write me a reference. Who the f*ck doesn't write someone a reference saying that they did the job they were contracted when they did the f*cking job they were contracted?  What the hell kind of person does that?  I guess you probably need to take a look at people in the Northern Hemisphere (around Oxford) and the work that I did on the topic of delusions and see who got credited for my work.  Since my work isn't credited for me or to me at all.  Allll of the payroll for him.  Allll of the payroll for him.  Is he f*cking dead yet?  Sterelny would say.  Is he f*cking dead yet?  Or how about Dave Chalmers.  Let's see..  The Zombie Army of New York.  I suppose it did in deed come to be.  All these young adults..  Right bout when it was time to pay them.  Time to sign off on their qualification completion.  Time to sign off on completion of their training.  They all up and died of Covid.  Depopulated the city  a bit so there was room for old retired people people to move into the city.  And they wouldn't have to worry about paying the old retired people. Except of course they likely aren't retired at all.  All of the payroll for them.  ALl of the payroll for them.  Let's send generations of people off to die because it's soooooo cmopetitive.  Once people have 3x or 4x or 9x the payroll that's how many people need to die for them?  It's soooooo competitive.  It's sooooo cmopetitive.  Are they f*cking dead yet?  How about today?  Did they die today?  Can I has payroll now?  You could just hand me your work and your payroll too.  Right?  Just hand it oer and go curl up and die now, there's a good boy.  Alllllll of the payroll for you.  Your grand plan, there of nasty brutish and short tragedy of commons race to the bottom psychopath land overtaken by taken over by psychopaths.  All of the everything for you.  ALll of the everything for you.   You you you and your f*cking selfishh.  Just f*cking take everything.  There's nothing here.  No universities at all.  No helthcare.  No judiciary.  No speak English.  Cant' parse the constitution.  Does not matter what any of the laws are  becuase they refuse to uphold them.  No point passing new ones or anything.  No point hearing the cases because they can't / won't uphold the laws.  They pretend to be too stupid to read them.  There' snothing here. .  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  Wah wah wah mooooooore money.  There aren't any people.  March them off to die..   Breed more breed more breed more.  Then put them on ventillators and remove them when it's time to graduate them or time to put them on payroll.  Nothing here.  Nobody home. </p>

    <p>They won't fund social services.  And nobody wants 'social services'.   Not voluntarily.  Who voluntarily chooses to go off to a 'social service' school to be abused by pedophiles?  But they insist on screening and selecting and choosing pedophiles to put them on payroll as teachers.  To trade them around.  Most highly valued employees, apparently. They would only employ pedophiles if only they could find enough pedophiles to entirely populate the whole teaching profession with them.  But they are so very very very in demand, they want them for Medicien, too.  Dr Leeks most highly valued esteemed member of the profession who needed to be re-deployed to continue on his crimes in Melbourne after he'd rolled out is social service programme for New Zealand.  So, then, who voluntarily chooses to do education in NZ.  To have healthcare in NZ.  I mean, there's nothing there.  What do you have to do to reduce demand for social services.  The government takes all of the tax money (for trafficking mostly children for sex offenses, one can only suppose) and takes all of the payroll all of the payroll all of the payroll and shares it around with the money makers..  ANd everyone else can curl up and die.  Once they've takekn everything from them...  They can, what did the courts say 'burn themselves out'.  That's what people do.  They voluntrily choose to hnd over all fo their work nd all of their payroll to the pedophiles and psychopaths.  Riiiiight.  That's how we ensure we have the lowest valued people in the world for everyone else to do experiments on etc.  Real destination for all the psychopaths in the world.  The leaders can't even parse the constitution.  I guess that was why they were carefully hand-picked to lead.  I mean, it can't be that hard to find someone who lacks the cpacity to process an application and pay them half a million dollars per year to not process applications.  There aren't any people in NZ, apparently.   Nobody applied.  See, they designed the forms such that when you hit 'submit' the form jams so that they could say nobody applied.  They put a 'you failed to pass the test to establish that you are not a robot' declaration on the form for when you lodge a complint with the human rights people.  I mean to say the people on payroll designed a system to tell people that they failed the test to establish that they were a person when they try and lodge a complaint bout human rights violation.  There is nothing in these lnds.  It is a garbage land of nothing.  I understand various people pat themselves on teh back all self-congradulatory that htey made it in life.  HOw many slaves do they keep?  That's the measure or the mark of success in these lands.  Right?  How many people were murdered or how many hostages are there such that they can smugly congradulate themselves on everything it is that they are and everything it is that they have.  All the work they do to undermine and stabotage and prevent and prohibit and obstruct and lie and cheat and swindle and...  That's the only game in town.  Right?  Psychopath land.  Puts out a beacon to the world begging to be put out of it's misery.  Nobody wnted things to be any different.  They didnt' get any applications or any applicants who wanting anything to be different.  Just a  bunch people tucking in behind there then trying to prove their worth with how many heads they got.  There's nothing here.</p>

    <p>Several people lodged several complaints about Malachi.  They didn't just 'suspect' that he was being abused, they were pretty sure that he was being.  They were sure enough about it for several people to lodge several complaints.  And the complaints were ignored until he died.  The point is that you don't need to mandate people complaining.  People did complain.  They say 'thanks for complaining we now mark your name as a complainer no payroll for you' and work to ensure that the fears of the complainants are realised.  That is what you get for complaining.  See?  See?  See?  Now the courts are going to work to take custody of anyone who does not comply with 'Medical Directive' (shall we say).  Even when the 'Medical Directive' is unlawful (right Ashley?).  What a f*cking farce of a farce-land.  Meanwhile...  Where is credit for my Degree?  Where is my offer of enrolment in MBChB?  What a f*cking joke...  We don't have any Doctors.  Wah wah wah wah wah.  Nobody applied for that position.  We threw all the applicants for that away.  Put a bunch of teenagers to work and threw them in prison (or worse) when it was time to pay them if we couldnt' convince them to 'burn themselves out' all voluntary-like.  Dr Leeks is the only game in town.  The only one who gets to be on payroll.  What a f*cking farce of a joke-land.  There's nothing here.  Nobody home.</p>

    <p>Chris Whelan should really be put to work campaigning for people with intellectual handicap to be paid.  I mean to say, his statutory function is clear, in law.  To uphold the quality and integrity of NZ University qualifications and to ensure we are fulfilling our obligations to protect whistle-blowers, according to international law.  In response to this (his job description) he gets the complaints -- and he throws them away.  He says that the compliaints are not really complaints.  They are ikdhierkhjgjf and not complaints.  So he doesn't need to do anything with them, at all.  He says that students aren't employees so NZ has no interntional obligations to do anything about them at all.  He says that the quality of NZ Universities is such that they couldnt' be or go any lower and so since they would  be better than they are if he were to actually process a complaint his duty is to ensure that the complaints are not processed.  Sorry, they aren't complaints.  They are klerjiorkjghdfjgf.  I don't know how quickly he could screw a lid on a jar...  But I see how quicklky he can take a complaint that was emailed to the address that you send complaints to and...  Forward that to the police.  Which is what his policy tht he wrote for himself to follow says that he should do.  It gets the complaint (in the complaint email) and it hits 'forward' to the police's address.  He is supposed to collect up evidnece sot hat the police can't say 'we don't have enough money to get a police officer to investigate white collar stuff Wah wah wah pay us more money or we won't investigate'.  It is his job desccription in statute to collect up the evidnece tht is relevant and forward tht to police.  So, then, wehre is the evidnece tht Chris Whelan has the willingness or ability to do his job?  I mean...  50 cents an hour for him to not get a single complaint to the police?  Perhps we should pay him by the number of complints he recieves tht he then gets to police with evidnce...  But then his payroll would be 0.  Because that's the work that he did.  0 work.  so.  To be clear...  They pay him excess of quarter of a million dollars per year in order to ensure that the statutory function of his job (the Chief Executive of the New Zealand Vice Chancellor's Committee) is not fulfilled by him.  Is not fulfilled by anyone.  NOw...  Is it stupidity?  It is incapacity?  What kind of incapacity could there be?  To not  be able to set up automated 'please get me the evidnce that will be forwarded with your complint' and then forward the complaint and evidenc to the police.  He says that emails to the 'complaint' email are not complaints.  Malicoiusness.  Malevolence.  They pay him to ensure that his statutory function is not performed.  Not by him . NOt by anyone.  The reason they pay him so much (quarter of a millino per year)  is because it was only supposed to be temporary.  I mean to say, they know it is only a matter of time before the game is up.  The jig is up.  Someone points out the f*cking obvious:  He isnt' willing or able to work that job.  At which point he needs to go away.  They will have to redeploy him to, I don't know, go be Vice Chancellor of the Univesrity of Queensland.  To throw away applications and completions and to hand over the intellectual property to the northern hemisphere for various people over there to take credit for it.  One can only suppose.  F*cking psychopths of the waste-land.  The courts get a judge out of retirement (waas it?) One not appointed by proper process to not see anyting wrong with the inability or unwillingness of him to do his job..  ANd the junior law person was sent back to Univesrity for a ...  20  year masters degree.  Was it?</p>

    <p>I mean, it isn't like Waikato has any research outputs.  I mean, there isn't a journal, or anything.  It isn't like Australiasia has any research outputs.  Everything is hidden behind a paywall.  Look at the things they choose to fund.  The world ils hostile and I'm a selfish f*ck.  Yay you.  We can go around labelling people stupid or whatever and bullying them into handinf all the work over to us so we can take credit for all of their work all of their work attribted to us and all of the payroll for us.  They can pult the stupid in bred intellectually handicapped children of the administration in the high value half a million dollar jobs per year.  Wear a fancy suit to take the complaints and throw them in the bin.  I suspect you can find various people currently kept on less than 50 cents per hour who can do a better job of hitting 'forward' on an email (especially given that it wouldnt' be that hard to set up an autor-forward before employing them so, effectively, they don't need to do anything at all except keep out of the f*cking way of the autormated - it comes into the email inbox and goes out of hte emamil outbox to police' processing by the New Zealnd Vice Chancellors Committee.  Most highly esteemed government executive department.  F*cking psychopaths.  What Universities?  What training system? All of the f*cking money for Chris Whelan.  Send his right royal smarminess around the f*cking world blackbirding for underage teenager slaves. F*cking psychopath.</p>

    <p>Apparently it's not systemic.  It's personal.  It's all very very very partiuclar and very very personal against me.  That's what makes it okay, in the eyes or mind or hearts of the courts.  That they declare it to all be very very very very particular and very very very very personal against or about me.  Not a matter of public interest to New Zealand or Internatinal Community at all.  I must pay the costs, I must pay the costs, I must pay the costs of Chris Whelan's inability or unwillingness to take tkhe complaints and forward them to the police along with evidence of what the claimant is saying is wrong.  Apparently, also, how the Univesrities have been treating me is not any different from hwo they are treating most everybody else.  So it's personal enough against me to not be a matter of public interest (therefore I must pay) but it's also not that they are treating me any differently from anybody else (which is apparently what makes how they are treating me okay).  Garbage garbage garbage garbage garbage output from the courts.  I have filed everything that needs to be filed for hte court of appeal.  Filed it close to a year ago, now.  THey say they will keep granting me extesion after extension after extension while they wait for me to pay the ocurts pay teh courts pay the courts pay the courts.  I should pay the courts for the crimes of the Universities so the Universities can take the money and give the VC's payrises.  All the payrises for the administration.  They ned to get the money out quicklky quickly quickly quickly they seem to have decided that the gig is only temporary, you see.  They need to quickly quickly quickly get the money out since people are starting to catch on that there' snothing here.  NObody would voluntarily choose to 'enrol' in a programme of study that is slavery.  That's all it is.  There's nothing there.  But Waikato has established precedent that they can claim that students are enrolled in various things (even invoicing loans to the studnets name with the IRD) when the studnet never aven applied to that programem or course of study.  THey are telling lies and fibs to the government about who are students and about what their programmes of study are.  Tehy are keeping false transcripts and false records.  There aren't any universities here.  Nothing.  Nothing nothing at all.  They won't allow there to be.  They can't  / won't even process an applicatin.  Ffs.  There's nothing there.</p>

    <p>Covid was political.  Curing the common cold has long been on the bucket list for science.  To see if they could.  HIV was an interesting target because they infected enough people with it to cry cry cry cry cry that they needed more and more and more money for researching it.  ANd they learned a lot by finding people who (despite their very very best efforts) did not become sick with the virus even though they had been exposed to heavy doses that would have long previously killed most everybody else.  THey find the immunologiclly elite in this manner or way then sign then up all voluntary like to take one for the team of everybody else and take and take and take from them to discover what it is about them tht solved the problem.  Anyway, HIV was an interesting target because it evolves defences in real time so they can make a case for more constant monitoring and adjustment to treatment.  Not a one dose does it.  An ongoing reigime.  Ongoing dependency.  Anyway, Respiratory Syncytical VIrus was something that there were apparent epidemics of, in children, every year.  Before Covid.  Then when there was Covid there wasn't much of that.  Apparently  because the kids were staying home.  But they weren't..  They were still going to child care and school.  Mostly.  I had thought.  Anyway..  Apparently Respiratoary Syncytical Virus is a different virus.  Only I don't know that it is.  If they sequence the virus that is causing the syncytium it will turn out to be Covid, I suppose.  See, syncytium is just something that can be observed in the tissue of the lungs.  It is something that viruses do.  What is more interesting is what virus in partiuclar is causing it.  Since we don't believe in Covid in children, I mean to say.  I suspect that it simply is Covid in children.  They did not want to shut down the early childhood and schools and so on.  Not really.  Socially engineering whether it is was better for the government to take the kids for however many hours of every day or whether the parents would do a better job of bullying nd abusing them at home.  One can only suppose.  So that, you know, the children of the administration can be the only game in town.  But only of the administration feel kindly about their children.  No idea why they would when they could simply keep everything to and for themselves and murder their children.  Right Sterelny?  I guess they better devote themselves to the task of..  What was that?  Making you not want ot kill them.  Riiiiight.  </p>

    <p>Somesomething something about the USA giving a cash injection to NZ for NZ media content.  It isn't throwing the cat amongst the pigeons..  It is throwing the child to the pedophiles.  That kind of a thing.  You get the idea.  The administration flocks in squabble squabble squabble everybody wants to manage media content now.  Payrises for the administration!  Payrises for the administration!  Payrises for the administrationt to keep slaves!!!  They don't pay the workers.  SO the only people 'wrokign that job' (so to speak wink wink nudge nudge chortle chortle chortle chortle snort) are the people who..  Virtue is it's own reward.  Only it isn't.  The most virtuous are required to bear allll the costs alllll the costs allll the costs allllll the costs.  Vice is it's own reward.  Those with psychopthic tedancies.  The people who wnat to do it for wrongful deathbringing bullyling and abusing and sexual violations...  Most highly valued.  They don't complain about anything or anyone.  Yessir yessir three bags full sir.  Anything anything you say sir.  Sooooo charasmatic.  Sooooo charming.  Yes sir yes sir anything you say sir.  Sucking it up sucking it up sucking it up and kicking it down.  Taking it out on the vulnerablel.  The ones who will only every be punished for complaining.  Moving the offernders around and along most highly valued employees.  The ones who didn't learn to take what they could for as long as they could just because they could from the vulnerable all 'burned themselves out all voluntary-like'.  The right royal plan to keep the region the detention camp slave land garbage producing garbage garbage garbage land of the world.  It hands it over.  I wasn't like it was going to do anyting with it.  No secondary processing.  No manufacturing.  No up-value of anything.  Take the primary resources and hand them over.  Hand them over.  Hand them over.  No secondary anything.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  Nada.  Zip.  Zilch.  Zero.  Nothing of any value at all.  Are they dead yet?  How about now?  Did they die today?  How about today?  Are they dead yet?  Alllll of the payroll for them.  Alllll  of the payroll for them.  Hav eyou written a wonderful sequel to 'sex and death' and 'the evolved apprentice' yet?  Is it an edited collection of everybody else's work???  How could cooperation possibly have evolved?  Why..  It didn't.  Nothing to see.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  It takes the f*cking thesis and it gets it to the external examiners.  No?  What the f*ck does it do, then?  Alllll of the payroll for them. Alllll of the payroll for them.  They can't even parse the constitution.  What constitution?  What laws?  What secondary processing?  What applications to enrol?  Party party party.  Let's have a party.  Let's go to 'university' to eat our f*cking lunch.  What a f*cking farce.  </p>

    <p>Amazing how many people volunteered for the gas chambers back in Germany.  Right?  Volunteered to see whether that was an effective dose for what ailed them.  All voluntary-like.  The virtual healthcare that was virtually offered to cure them of what ailed them.  They had been consented.  It was in their best interests.  Their best interests of the best interests of the team where they were required to take one for it.  Nothing has changed.  Not in this part of the world, that's for sure.  Hey, that's a great idea.  Then the peopel in this part of the world will be so happy happy happy to take up positins as third class citizens of various other places.  We can keep them moving along moving along moving along.  That's likely how people were big game hunters.  They just needed to keep them moving along for long enough for them to starve to death because the large game could't graze while walking whereas the people could.   Haha that makes us better than you in every rubric that matters.  Our vermin are still here haha.  Still breeding.  So they have something to eat when times get tough.  Sic them on the neighbours.</p>

    <p>It isn't sexist to ask what Jacina Ardern and the leader of Finland could possibly have in common such that they needed to meet in person, in New Zealand, of all places.  Why the hell would the leader of Finland travel all the way down here?  Why wasn't zoom good enough?  Why couldn't they have met half way (ish) on diplomatically neutral terrain?  The leaders of most other nations will not travel to NZ.  About it not being safe, and all, since the health system here is keeping hostages or whatever and not keeping medication records and so on.  The risk of unlawful arbitrary detention makes it not worth it.  The trade convention centre in Auckland was burned down twice.  Apparently the fault of an apprentice becuase the only engineers that woudl be acknowledged as being engineers here engineered a blowtorch such that an apprentice could  be blamed for leaving the blowtorch on unattended thereby causing a fire twice.  So say the courts.  Right?  The only lawyers who got their degrees from the finest institutions of New Zealand.  Righty, ho.  No internatioal trade conference in NZ, then.  ONe can only suppose...  Anyway...  Why on earth would the leader of Finland need to come and have a yakkity yak yak yak to Jacinda where NZ is in charge of or responsible for (or whatever) her safety while she is here.  Why oh why oh why??  What could they possibly have to discuss....  Or maybe it's personal.  Party party party, then.  Break open the booze and let's have a celebration on the taxpayers dime.  What could Jacinda possibly have to discuss with the leader of Finland?  Maybe she wants to know how she can get an honorary degree from Harvard so she can get started on the work for that now (yeah, right).  Maybe she wants to traffick some people here to our fine establishments.  Maybe some trading of slaves...  What could they possibly have to discuss? </p>

    <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/130032273/patrina-got-punched-by-a-colleague-so-why-did-she-get-sacked  She got sacked because she saw soemething that she perceived to be an injustice and she spoke out about it.  She was supposed to let the injustice slide and then take her frustration out on something beneath her.  Maybe one of the clients who she managed to isolate with no witnesses.  Maybe her dog or her children when she got home.  Doesn't matter.  Point is that she was supposed to keep her yap shut.  The aim the goal the purpose the point is to fill up the 'employment' positions with people who keep their yaps shut and vitimise people and don't complain about the victimisation that they see.  What do you think happened to the person who smashed her in the head?  Where did she get promoted to go work next?  Who wrote her a reference to say 'well she smashed someone in the head, but she never complained about anything ever.  Best employee ever.  Must have!  Would totally hire again - except the publicity...  Would recommend'.  THe only people who get references.  Right?  Glowing references.  Glowing.  Alll of the money and awards for them to celebrate their crimes!!!  </p>

    <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/world/480109/donald-trump-s-call-for-termination-of-constitution-condemned  Taking the piss is all it is.  That's what Australia needs to do.  Since the government refuses to  honor the constitution.  Be honest about that, then.  I mean to say, it is written into the Australian Constitution that NZL is a state of Australia.  Australia refuses to  honor that (for better or worse).  Australia says it doesn't have to - because it accepts that NZ did not consent to being a State of the Federation of Australia.  But what reason does anybody have to believe that teh question was ever put to the people of New Zealand?  The fact is, it is written into the constitution that NZL is in fact a State of Australia.  The signing of that constituitno was witnessed by the Queen of England.  No federal election voting papers and on election on whether or not the peopel of NZL want to be part of the Australian Federation (or if they want to be a separate country either under British or independent rule) has ever been put to the NZL people.  Australia refuses to supply voting papers to New Zealanders.  Things it's f*cking hilarous to treat NZers as second or third class Australians.  Keep NZers unemployed and preferentially give the employment positions to Australians or to outright foreigners.  Brought to NZL specifically for the purpose of taking jobs away from NZers so as to keep NZers unemployed as slaves.  F*cking farce.  So many instances of NZers having their applications thrown away and the positions (for training or employment) going only to people unable and or unwilling to do the f*cking job (e.g., Chris Whelan and various people unwilling or unable to process applications or completions or get complaints or theses to where the f*ck they are supposed to go) or readverting over and over to overseas.  So that they can find the 'we had to move this guy along because he was a pedophile bully who was violent' so NZL could do 'must have!!!'</p>

    <p>The case at the moment...  The politically contrived case...  The one where the parents say they do not give consent for their kid to have open heart surgery unless the surgeon agrees to only use blood products from people who have not been vaccinated.  The case where the courts are going to deliberate on whether or not to give temporary custody to the surgeons.  Was it?  Or the Medical Students?  Maybe the building apprentice with temporary access to the hospital?  The nurses?  Oraka Tamariki or whatever it's called, I suppose.  To sign the consent form and then hand custody back.  So,  basically, what happens is that various Government employees.  Surgeons, I suppose.  Or the nurses.  Or whomever.  Decide that this or that treatment is what they reccommend.  And if the person or the persons parents don't sign the form all voluntary-like then..  They will be forced to undergo the demanded.  Requested.  Offered.  'Treatment'.  Otherwise they will have to pay they will have to pay they will have to pay the courts.  So the judge can hem and haw and decide... But whatever the judge decides various people have already decided that the parents must pay the parents must pay the parents must pay for not having voluntarily signed the consent forms, already.  The costs must  be borne by the people who do not hurry up and comply with directive from people on government payroll.  Right?  Let this be a lesson to you all.  Don't voluntarily have a kid, in NZ, unless you are prepared to hand it over to governent workers whenever they want.  Their track record is none of your concern.  Who can afford to..  Exist in NZ.  There aren't any persons here...  I guess.  That's the ideology.  Right?  The zombie army of the world, now.  No people.   No people.  No people...  Nothing hey.  Nada zip zilch zero.  I wonder whose kid gets to have a go at open heart surgery?  I wonder who gets tempoary swipe card access to do that.  And I mostly wonder how much they had to pay the university pay the university pay teh university pay the univesrity pay teh university.  Temporarily, of ocurse.  Until it's time for them to go away...</p>
