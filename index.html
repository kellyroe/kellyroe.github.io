                                <p>When I get some time I will try and make light and dark themes.  I prefer dark with low-contrast, but I understand it is not to everyone's tastes.</p>

                                <p> I started the Judicial Review tab to help me keep track of where things were up to for the various court cases.  It was helpful to me to have organised things in this way.  Things grew unexpectedly when it came to documenting how / why the University's forced so many versions of my thesis.  I likely will transition bundle-type documents off the publically viewable webpages, eventually.  Until then the evidence is here so people can assess for themselves if the University's are right that I am repetitive and meritless or if the University's are not entitled to be making those decisions becuase the University's are not external examiners and they aren't engaging in blind-grading work according to it's academic merits, at all.</p>
           
                                <p>You can contact me via the email address: email@kellyroe.org.
                                Yes, you probably read that correctly, 
                                my email address starts with the word "email".
                                I'll let you copy-paste that into whatever email programme you like.
