                                Apparently our hospitals are about to be over-taken by the common-cold.  But in better news, Ashley Bloomfield is non longer allowed to go about wearing (or recommending the people of New Zealand) wear their underwear on their faces.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Another intake of wrongly decided Medical (also Law etc) students will be starting their Degrees in a month or so.  I have taken to calling them the 'Hitler Youth'.  It is an insightful thing to call them, in many respects.  Let me explain.  There's the fact that they are chosen on the basis of heredity.  Who their parents are.  What post-code they were born to.  That's an important one.  It is also true that they have been told over and over from a very young age that they are the ruling elite who have been picked out to rule and be elite.  They have also been told from a very very young age that New Zealand is very racist and many people (people of certain races and people of certain post-codes) do not have access to health or education or justice, at all.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                They are chosen so young because they are in the grips of the government ideology of how things are and how things must be.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I mean no disrespect to the victims of the holocaust.  I understand people had their heads shaved and their teeth pulled out before being forced into communal showers where they were gassed.  I don't think that the New Zealand Government is doing that to the people en masse.  But I do think the government is very invested in racism and keeping people in their post-codes when it comes to refusing people access to healthcare and justice and so on.
                                </p>

                                <p>It makes the best sense of the way things are.  And of the garbage output that's been coming from the courts, recently.  Etc.
                                </p>
