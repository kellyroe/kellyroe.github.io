                             <p>I am file re-formatting my work and organising it into yearly increments.  E.g., </p>

                             <p>
                              <a href="./writing/ks.png">Here is an example of an email from Kim Sterelny (who will not write me a reference) so you can see how he chooses to speak to me.</a> 

                              I collated the 'few small chunks' as he refers to them, here:
                              </p> 

                                <p><a href="./publish/2013-rep.pdf">Roe, (2013).  A few small chunks for 2013.</a>
                                </p>

                                <p>Did you win, Sterelny?  Did you manage to starve the humanity out of me?  I'm just begging to house-sit for you and go away on camping trips.  It's sooooo important to my career to do anything anything anything.  Did Carl graduate, yet?  For how many decades did you get him house-sitting for you?</p>

                                <p>Oh noooooo!  Don't cut me from the programme!!!! I'll do anything anyting anything anything!  I'm not even enrolled -- but I'll keep sending you work!  I'll keep sending you work that you can reattribute authorship of.  Publish it in your journal.  Attributed to someone else you'd rather payroll because you like to keep me poorly.</p>

                                <p>I guess the idea is that you pay peanuts and you get monkeys.  That way Sterelny can be the only game in town. </p>

                                <p>They pay him soooo much.  What's his excuse, then, for behaving like an ape?</p>

                                <p>How  many years did Dave Wall give Daniel Stoljar doctoral work -- before he was hospitalised, given dextrose or glucose before thiamine -- which put him into a coma so he nearly died?  How many years was he handing over doctoral work before things deteriorated to that point?</p>

                                <p>The whole time I was at the ANU I didn't see anybody with reports from external examiners.  Nobody had their work go out for external examination -- did they?  I didn't see anybody (from any department)  have a scheduled oral examination or defence.  No public defenses.  I don't remember seeing anybody in a doctoral gown for graduation, either.  Did people actually get conferred qualifications?  How?  How are some people getting paid employment for post-doctoral fellowship positions?  People other than Jacinda Ardern, I mean.  For the book she's going to write, one day.  Or the book she's going to have attributed to her, or something.  For her Honorary doctorate for all the research output she's done already.  Of course.  Enough for 3 fellowships from Harvard!</p>

                                <p>What education and training system?  There's nothing there.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  What a f*cking hoax of a scummy scam.  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>Waikato won't send work out to externals, either, else if they do they won't listen to what externals have to say.  That's if they can even arrange for it to be examined for the degree I was actually enrolled in (which, turns out, they can't).  My external requested an oral defense (after they asked him to write reports of it for the wrong qualification) then he seems to have forgotten what year it is requesting an oral defense to be held in his report of 2012.  What education and training system?  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p> <a href="./writing/OSex2019.pdf">Overseas Examiner's report of 2019 (he seems to think it's 2012)</a>  Do you think he knows what's reasonable to expect of a 120 point MPhil qualification?  Quigley says the MPhil is not an EFTS qualification.  But the Tertiary Education Commission says that if the University wants to bill it to Student Loans then they need to report (1) points (2) EFTS and (3) enrolment dates.  They billed it to my Studnet loan therefore it is an EFTS based qualification.  I'm sure I don't need to explain this to the person who was the best applicant for VC of the University of Waikato.  I'm sure he knows that 120 points = 1 EFT = 34 weeks work (including the examination period) and I'm sure he has the application to enrol that was acknowledged as having been received by the University by the published deadline.  I have acknowledgement that they received it by the deadline and the Statutory Law (educaiton and training act) says that I am eligible.  But that's too hard for the most qualified applicant for the position of VC of Auckland (x 2) and it's also too hard for the judiciary!  Wow!!  Must  be something about our educaiton and trianing system and what being 'most qualified' for employment meeeeeans.  Or something.  That must be the problem.  Yeah.  Right.  </p>

                                <p>The Office of the Ombudsman</p>

                                <p>Peter Boshier is over 65 and it's time for him to retire, therefore.  It's time to appoint someone else to be head of that organisation.</p>

                                <p>I doubt the integrity of their hiring practices.  </p>

                                <p>I have applied for 7 positions, now.  Of all levels.  From principal to senior to a junior advisor or investigator position where they say that they will provide training.  I don't even make it to interview.  I find it hard to believe that.  I doubt the integrity of the hiring practices.  I mean, the Ombudsman need to retire.  Right?  But they haven't retired him.  He's still on payroll -- right?  They won't replace him.  Enough said.  </p>

                                <p>NZ does not have a functioning administration or judiciary.  The Office of the Ombudsman is supposed to be an NGO but they don't seem willing or able to do their job, either.</p>

                                <p>The disability community had to go to the UN, repeatedly.  Because nobody from within NZ would listen.  That includes the office of the Ombudsman.  They aren't doing it.  They won't do it.  They don't see anything wrong.  The head of their organisation isn't even supposed to be there.  That's the leadership from the top.  He's supposed to be retired.</p>

                                <p>I'm just saying here that I applied.  So that if they cry cry cry cry cry that they just can't seem to find anybody willing and able to write reports of the wrongs that are being committed in the hospitals etc etc.  Well, I applied.  But they thought other candidates would be a better fit for their organisation than me.  If that's true, then okay.  But I don't know what the Office of the Ombudsman would say if they were asked to give an account of what they've been doing (or not doing) to international agencies.  Not doing unannounced inspections etc etc.  Not seeing anything wrong.</p>

                                <p>I don't know.  Maybe the UN etc is more interested in having people shut up and stop going to them complaining about things.  Maybe the UN instructs NZ to shut up the complainants and is more interested in that than in actually putting things right.</p>

                              <p>I just know that I got garbelled output from the reports that I got.  And I don't know why.  They do do some good reports.  I've thought.  There is good being done within the organisation.  I've seen.  But just garbage output when it came to me.  Maybe it was lack of resources.  One person trying to get their head around it and do it.  But no...  I mean...  I was getting sensible output from the Tenancy Tribunal.  Then all of a sudden...  Garbelled output.  The first 2 adjudicators were fine.  Then garbelled output.  Removing anything that makes sense.  What person do you see?  Australasia is Terra Nullus.  The white people came and declared it thus.  They looked in the mirror and no people.  No people.  No people did they see.
