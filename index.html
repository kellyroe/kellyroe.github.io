                            <p>NZ doesn't need to train any Orthopedic Surgeons.  We can just hire the from South Africa and they can come here for 10 days and we can imprison their wives in the name of Psychiatry and pay QC laywers to plead not guilty by reason of insanity and keep the South Africans imprisoned in NZ forensic psychiatry institutions... It's just soooo much cheaper that way.  For a 10 day hire of Orthopedics..  It's sooooooo competitive....</p>

                            <p>https://www.seek.co.nz/job/68737472?type=standout#sol=8b6c3b2377e30b2b82e582f5ce601196aeae06e5  Wow. There's a research-teaching-practice job (not)!  Training the next generation (not!) What a f*cking scummy hoax of a f*cking scummy scam.  How much Quigley gets paid again?  So he can write 'research papers' on how he's 'morally grey' (to morally blind)?  What a f*cking joke.  </p>

                            <p>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/politics/pm-hipkins-says-china-nz-relationship-requires-careful-management/UYJB2XREAFAAZCLWAKDDVFBEJ4/  Uh... NZ *does not work*.   Mate.  NZ:  IT'S NOT WORKING.  You know how you know when it's working?  THEY PAY YOU.  THEY PAY YOU.  THEY PAY YOU.  WHERE ARE MY WAGES?  NZ:  IT'S NOT WORKING.  WHERE IS THE MONEY, EH????  </p>

                            <p>What happened to 'pay restraint' for people on more than $100,000 per year.  Because of how people are really doing it hard with the cost of living increase.  The price of fruit and veges etc.  People are really doing things hard, right now.  So there is supposed to be 'pay restraint' for people earning over $100,000 per year.  So...  Look at all the f*cking paid employment positions that are being advertised, right now, more than $100,000 per year.  Mostly fixed term positions of 6 months to 1 year only (to get past the next election only).  Positions paying couple hundred thousand dollars per year.  To get past the next election only.   NZ:  It's not working.  You f*cking psychopath.  Where is our elected leader?  Oh, she's been taken into US custody.  So we can choose between you and 'Come on barbie let's go party' (I guess National pissed off Hollywood so they threw you a past release for free).  There is no alternative.  There isn't anything here...  No hint of 'try'.</p>

Talk to us about the infectious disease protocols that you follow.  Also:  Who was the medical illustrator who illustrated your earlier 'opinion pieces' on how face masks were able to reduce the amount of virus passing through a semi-permeable membrane.  You did not illustrate the utility of face-masks yourself.  Correct?  You had a medical illustrator illustrate that for you.  I am wondering who they were.  They did a really great job of the illustrations.  Don't you think? </p>

                            <p>So... Do the students who work in your infectious disease laboratory have N95 face masks that are fit tested, yet?  I am curious...</p>

                                What is the point of this?
                            </p>

                            <p>Why don't we have NZ trained psychiatrists?</p>

                            <p>I suppose the idea is...  Who, in the Northern Hemisphere, wants to move all the way to NZ?  What are they trying to run away from?  Are they about to be prosecuted for raping their patients or...</p>

                            <p>I suppose it would be easier, then, for people to write them glowing references to help them move to NZ.  That way they won't have to bother with the expense of a trial and possible expense of keeping them imprisoned etc etc.  Else, maybe NZ is actually really rather more overt only considering applications from people who are pretty upfront about them needing to move on since their patients are being more and more vocal about crimes against them.  Like how Dr Leeks was a really desirable hire for Melborne precisely because of all the complaints that his victims were making about him.  That was what made him such a truly desirable hire for Melbourne.  Wasn't it?  The Royal Australasian College of Psychiatrists thought that it would be a good idea to move him someplace else (some place typically thought to be highly desirable - Melbourne) to better enable and facilitate his continued and ongoing crimes against patients.</p>

                            <p>So, now we understand what it is that they seem to most value...  We can think a  bit more about this advertisement...</p>

                            <p>I suppose they want someone, really, who isn't registered.  Who hasn't completed their training etc.  That way they can get them paying and paying and paying the 'University' of Otago.  Then they can be supervised by Professor Glue and he can check that they are on board with his practices of drugging the (particularly young female) patients with ketamine (a known date rape drug) and so on, in the name of 'treatment'.  Whatever drugs are easy and cheap.  Sourced from vet science, even.  Check that the new hire (who pays and pays and pays the 'University') is on board with the communal sleeping practices that are thought to be culturally normal or desirable, or whatever.  Training the boys to be girls to be boys in the name of equity...  All this 'revoluntary' treatment that NZ is involved in.  Auckland 'University' getting permission to manufacture LSD to give that to the people with anxiety or depression, now.  To keep them involutarily detained in conditions the UN inspectors would likely say constitute torture for their psychosis, now... The lack of medical records.  The lack of prescription records.  THe unlawful druggings...  It's hard to find people to payroll for psychiatry in NZ.  Do you wonder why?</p>

                            <p>1 FTE position is supposed to be shared between 3 people, I'm pretty sure that is how that is supposed to go.  1/3rd the time doing research, 1/3rd the time teaching the next lot, 1/3rd the time doing clinical practice.  But I suppose the idea is to 'divide and conquer' because it's soooooooooo competitive.  The present head of psychiatry at Auckland was recruited in this manner to do a PhD in neuroscience with PRofessor Glue -- correct?  He came from overseas...  And he worked in obgyn over there.  Correct?  Quite the change..  From obgyn to doing a PhD with Professor Glue to then be appointed head of the secure ward at Auckland city hospital when Auckland is manufacturing LSD and not keeping medication charts.  What a scummy scam.  Hoax.  What hospital?  What University?  What a f*cking farce.</p>

                            <p>Of course what it is really about, I would imagine, is not the medication that knocks people out.  It's the medication that makes them forget.  People don't remember what happened to them when they had surgery.  Right?  They don't remember the crimes that the government committed against them.  All those abuse survivors of state care...  If only they had have been drugged properly so that they never would say anything about what happened (the behaviorist intervention) or they would believe they asked for it to happen they wanted it (the cognitive intervention) or they don't even remember (medication).  Medication is best, clearly.  Nobody remembers the government of NZ doing anything wrong.  Nobdoy remembers the laws or the function of laws.  What are various people on payroll for?  Nobody remembers...  Must be something in the water, I guess...  </p>

                            <p>Inhumane.  What people?  There aren't any people,  here...</p>

                            <p>It's sooooooo competitive!  It's soooooooo competitive!!!! It's suuuuuuch a competitive and hostile environment!!!!  There's really nothing there.</p>

                            <p>The 'psychiatrists' are kept busy with all the people the court orders to be detained in the name of psychiatry to be placed in psychiatry institutions rather than prisons.  WHy?  So they can have electric shock treatment and have their 'nasal polyps' (so to speak) removed (suction to the frontal lobes, I suppose) and LSD and ketamine, now.  The government employees are giving them, in the name of 'treatment', I suppose.  Sign the prisoners up, those held under the mental health act, sign them up for the experimetal trials?  Is this how we do?  'Psychiatry' is too busy 'treating' the involuntary non-voluntary those detained against their will. What people do you see?  What people?  Inhumane institution of abuse.  Only.  How is this medicine?  But then...  How is medicine medicine.  I mean to say how is there any health system in NZ, at all?  The nasal polyp surgery isn't for the psych patients, specifically.  The radiation treatment in the name of cancer care etc.  Helping me helping me helping me help myself to you.  It's soooooo competitive!!!! It's sooooo competitive that Auckland cant' even / wont' even calcualte a GPA and process an application according to published selection algorithm.</p>

                            <p>Apparently it is sooooooo competitive that Auckland and Otago get around 3x as many applications as there are available places.  That's not as competitive as the US where they might get 8x as many.  But, then, the US encourages people to apply for 8 places in order to get 1.  So they artificially inflate their numbers.  Suppose that it really is that competitive, to do Medicine, in NZ.  They get 3x as many applications as there are available places.  So...  If you apply 3x you might well get a place -- right?  How about if you apply 6x?  At what point do you start to wonder...  What if your full time GPA is 8.6 and you apply multiple times to a programme that is supposed to be selecting on the basis of 'academic merit' primarily?  What then?  Oh, but maybe the problem is the lack of social skills...  But nobody said there was any problem with lack of 'social skills' when one was an English or Psychology major... So that doesn't seem to be the problem...  What is the problem?  Gee... I wonder what the problem is...  </p>

                            <p>Medicine's response or reaction to the Cartwright Inquiry was that Dr Green was unlucky that they chose to go after him because what he was doing wasn't any different or worse than what anybody else was doing and what anybody else was still doing.  That was the response from those employed in Science and Medicine in NZ.  That is what they overtly teach their studnets.  How do I know?  Because I did more undergraduate level pathology etc in NZ Universities and I got the message loud and clear.</p>

                            <p>What health system?</p>

                            The writing page contains a variety of writing samples where I am the first, or only author.  The samples range from fairly tightly written technical pieces in philosophy and psychology to longer explorations or investigations where the role of the philosopher is supposed to be the 'critic and conscience of society'.  You will find samples of my undergrad and honors research and coursework.  A MA thesis, MPhil thesis, PhD thesis.  A co-authored book chapter.

                            The seminars page contains more than a dozen seminars that were presented to departmental seminars or international conferences.  I have provided the written version of the talk and powerpoint presentation for the majority of them.  </p>

                            <p>The teaching page provides a list of courses I have taught and the subject contents that I was sub-contracted to develop to help the students understand the contents of a texbook that I was told to teach from.</p>

                            <p>The judicial review page provides a list of legal proceedings that I have filed with various courts of New Zealand.  Presently, the Social Security Appeals Authority is required to pass judgment on whether or not the Ministry of Social Development's decision to refuse to provide advance benefit payment for security for costs set by court of appeal on grounds that 'Justice is not an essential need' is to be upheld or to be overturned.  There was a substantive hearing of this matter in September of 2022 and judgment is awaited.</p>

                            <p>Neil Quigley instructed me to complain to the Office of the Ombudsman and then take the University to Court if I was unhappy with how the University of Waikato handled my enrolment etc in 2018-2019.  I was very unhappy with them (1) refusing to enrol me in the programme I applied to (2) recording I  had been enrolled in programmes I never applied to.  (3)  Refusing to get a thesis that I submitted for examination out to external examiners so as to prevent them accepting it.  (4)  Sending a thesis I submitted for MPhil examination out for 'doctoral reports' to be written (sending it out to be examined for the wrong degree).  (5)  Refusing to base the outcome of external examination on the reports of external examiners.  How could any of this be considered acceptable?  Justice Toogood was reappointed from his retirement to write reports on the untimely deaths of Mason Pendrous and Olivia Podmore.  Both of whom died in state care (care of the Univeristy of Canterbury and Cycling NZ, respectively).  He was also given his day in court hearing Roe v University of Waikato legal proceedings. </p>

                            <p>The University of Auckland advised me that I needed to have completed a qualification within the last 5 years to be 'eligible' to study MBChB.  That was why I applied to do a 120 point MPhil with Waikato in 2018 and that was why I handed them a 50,000 word MPhil Thesis on September 14 of 2018.  Waikato refused to get that thesis out to externals.  They are not functioning as a University, at all.  It turns out that the Education and Training Act states that domestic adults are eligible to be  enrolled in the programme they applied to.  I applied to MBChB and I am a domestic adult who is over 20.  I mean to say that the statutory law of NZ says that I am eligible.  The Univesrity of Auckland had no right to throw my application away on grounds that they deemed me 'ineligible'.  They were required to process my application same as everybody else.  Enter my GPA, UMAT / UCAT score, interview score into their algorithm and offer me a place or not on the  basis of my rank order score.  Firstly, they entered incorrect information into my GPA field to try and tell me that my GPA wasn't good enough.  Then they simply refused to enter my GPA at all.  Apparently they just pick and choose whoever they want for whatever arbitrary reasons they want.  How is that working out for NZ?  Dr Leeks.  He wasn't picked becuase his rank order score was high enough.  He was picked on personal grounds for all the qualities they value.  Dr  Green (the pathologist who watched Maaori die without intervention).  Professor Glue.  All these people hand picked for all the qualities they value for Medical Doctors, in NZ.  Hand picked.  Exceptional.  Exceptions.  Each and every one of them.  It's all very very very very very very personal. </p>

                            <p> New Zealand does not seem to have a functioning tertiary education system.  The 'Universities' are not processing applications to enrol.  They are not acknowledging progression through training programmes.  They are not graduating people who have done the work for their degrees.  I am trying to remember whether ANY of the students at the Australian National University actually had their work go out for external examination at all, or whether the University simply decided that they had done enough for their degrees.  The Australian National University kept Carl Brusse re re re enrolled for more than 10 years as a doctoral student.  Correct?  How many times over did he write doctoral theses for the Australian National University while they only take more and more and more money from the government for keeping him re re re re enrolled.  So that his supposed 'supervisors' can be paid hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of base salary and research funding.  While they refuse to do the supervision job for which they are paid (where is the evidence of my being supervised?  Evidence of meetings?  Evidence of written comments on my written work?)   What education and training system?</p>

                            <p>Sterelny was paid how much each and every year to supervise graduate research studnets?  How much money was he paid?  He had no teaching work at all.  All he had to do was supervise students and do research work of his own.  Here is an idea...  Be editor of a journal so everybody sends their work to you.  Then you can reattribute authorship of it.  F*cking psychopath.  Where is evidence of your supervising me?  How much money were you paid to supervise me?  WHere is evidence of you doing the job for which you were f*cking well paid?  Psychopath.  It's soooooooo competitive!  IT's suuuuuch a hoooostile environment and I'm a f*cking selfish prick.  F*cking arsehole.  Oooooh soooooo motivating and inspiring.  IN f*ckign retard-land.  Psychopath.  Had one job to do.</p>

                            <p>Where does all the money go?  Half a million for Una Jagose.  Half a million for Ashley.  Each and every year.  Quarter of a million for Chris Whelan to take complaints he receives about the Universities of NZ and throw them away (to ensure his statutory function is not filled by him, is not filled by anybody at all).  Is Geoffrey Palmer still on government payroll?  How about his son?  They are both of them over the age of 65, aren't they?  The Judge who makes his career proclaiming and pronouncing judicial review of administrative action to be without teeth and removal from office (a remedy listed in the HIgh Court Rules) to be obsolte.  That's what obsolete meeeeeeeans.  To be listed in the laws of NZ.  All of the laws are obsolete, I suppose, since the NZ judiciary seems carefully exceptionally  hand-picked all chosen specially for the reason that they are unwilling and or unable to even parse the laws.  Lacking in the most basic reading comprehension.  </p>

                            <p>Everyone is supposed to say that they would leave NZ for Australia if they could.  Why?  Because Australia pays their workers higher wages.  So people can get on with living instead of constantly cry cry cry cry crying about how they don't have enough money to have their basic needs met.  Cry cry cry cry cry cry crying about how their basic needs aren't met.  It isn't about the money...  It is about withholding money being used as a tool or mechanism of bullying and abuse.  That's the problem, really.  Gaslighting.  It's not cold.  There must be something wrong with you.  Etc.  Intentionally withhholding for bullying and abuse.  That's basically the thing of it.  How badly do you have to treat people in NZ so that they will say 'of course we would rather move to Australia because NZ is just kept as a detention prison camp land and they don't pay their workers.  They don't pay their workers.  Half a million for Ashley.  Half a million for Una.  They don't pay their workers.  All these people over 65 who have paid off their mortgage on their modest family home they aren't supposed to be on payroll at all.  All the money for  them.  All the money for them.  All the money for them to enable their ongoing crimes.  All the money for them.  All the money for them.  All the money for them to keep endentured servants or slaves'.  F*cking psychopath land.  Will not have things any other way.</p>

                            <p>What is the hope for Australia, then?  Well, they chose to move Harlene Hayes from Otago to Western Australia after she refused to graduate around 1/3rd the medical students so as to get more and more and more money for the University by re re re enrolling them in the qualification.  So how are things in Western Australia, then?  On track for the 'how low can we go' game.  They chose to move Kim Sterelny from Victoria University Wellington (wellington wellington wells) to The Australian National University.  So that he could withhold graduations and keep studnets re re re re re enrolled with the Australian National University.  What evidence is there of him supervising his studnets to timely completion?  What evidence is there of him helping me with my thesis?  Any comments from him?  How about him simply passing it on to external examiners with a note from him saying he was too lazy or too much of a psychopath or whatever he thinks the problem was that he didn't help me with my thesis...  Let the externals work with me to get it done, then.  F*cking psychopath.  It's sooooo competitive.  Is he still on payroll?  How old is he?  How much in over-payments has he received already?  F*cking psychopath.  Yeah, Australia is really a destination...  How low can they go, hey?  Aspiring to new lows.  Obviously and clearly.</p>

                            <p>Dr Leeks for Melbourne.  Melbourne's really a destination place when Dr Leeks was considered the best hire they could do for Psychiatry.  </p>

                            <p>Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>Apparently it was Australian Payroll Systems that would not pay the NZ teachers.  Would not accept that they had graduated from their teacher training qualifications.  Refused to pay them.  This was near the start of labors first term (they are in their second term now).  Would not pay the teachers.</p>

                            <p>Why?  The 'teachers' were supposed to move to Australia and work in the child detention camps over there.  That was what Australia thought they would be good for.  Those were the paid positions in the vicinity.  Right?  Australia's version of Oraka Tamariki.  But they would  be paid because it was Australia.</p>

                            <p>The 'nursing' positions in Australia.  The detention camps for young people. For elderly people.  Government institutions of abuse.  Those.  Detention camps.  For the 'nurses' of NZ.  When NZ refuses to acknoweldge they have graduated.  When they want money.  Australia says they will pay them to work as unskilled unqualfied 'nurses' in the detention camps over there.</p>

                            <p>Then, in 15 years, they will round them all up and pop them into nuclear submarines and drown them in the Ocean.  Then blame Japan for nuclear contamination of the oceans.  Is that the plan?</p>

                            <p>Western Australia seems to want lists, now.  Lists of able bodies people to express an interest in 'working' in Western Australia.  Volunteers.  I wonder who will express an interest in volunteering to move to Western Australia after the most illustrious of Vice Chancellor's (Harlene Hayes) was trafficked (or something)  over there...  Really motivating and inspiring, she was.  Her leadership style.  All trained in Organisational Psychology for re structuring things around getting people re re re re applying for their old job (plus more duties) for less and less and less pay.  Oh,  but only those kept most poorly.  F*cking psychopath.</p>

                            <p>Why move to Australisia?  The people!  The people!  The people!  Who wouldn't want to bully and abuse and so on!  It's all about getting to bully and abuse the people!  The people!  The people!  What people?  There doesn't really seem to be anything left...  Maybe that's a function of not being paid a living wage...  Mooore money for the Vice Chancellors!  Pay rise for Quigley!  MOre and more money for keeping more and more graduate studnets re re re re re enrolled in qualifications they never applied to be enrolled in!  MOre money for Justice Toogood!   HOw old is Justice Toogood?  What is the retirement age for Judges?  How  much was Justice Toogood overpaid and who was supposed to have Judged Roe v University of Waikato?  NZ does not have a functioning Judiciary.  Australian Federal Court does not function.  They will not accept jurisdiction of NZ when it is in the Australian Constitution that NZ is the second named state of Australia.  They won't supply birth certificates and passports to NZers.  They won't pay NZ governmetn workers Australiain wages.</p>

                            <p>HOW IS IT SUPPOSED TO GO??</p>

                            <p>Suppose you pay me to teach students.  To teach them nursing or medicine or whatever.  Okay...  So suppose you only pay me to teach them.  I have a full time teaching workload.  That is what I am supposed to do.  Teach them.  You don't pay me to do research (you don't give me protected time in which to do research) you don't pay me to do clinical practice (you don't give me protected tim in which to do clinical practice.  I have one job to do:  Teach them.</p>

                            <p>Alright then.  What am I supposed to teach them?  I don't know...  Maybe I have time to do preparation for my teaching.  Maybe I do.  I don't know how many hours I'm expected to actually spend in front of the students.  The rest of the hours can be spent preparing for class and / or grading or examining them or their work, I suppose.  But what is the curriculum, then?  What are we supposed to teach them?  Or are we simply a detention camp facility.  Keeping teh studnets bums on the seats for however many hours.  They pay the 'university' or 'training college' or whatever for being 'students' for howevever many years... Ooooh and maybe they get lucky and graduate into teaching positions of their own.</p>

                            <p>My understanding was that 1/3rd the time was supposed to be spent teaching, 1/3rd research, 1/3rd clinical practice.  Why?</p>

                            <p>What are we teaching?  We can teach what we are researching.  What we are researching is preparation time, in a sense...  We can teach our research -- but that is a bit frought.  In particuar people are not very good at hearing or engaging in or with criticism from or by their peers...  Subjecting students to it can be even more frought...  But we can certainly teach them the things that we have been researching...</p>

                            <p>We can also say 'hey, a patient came in yesterday (suitably anonymous) and presented with these symptoms..  How would you proceed?  We can teach on the basis of our clinical experience.  Teaching cases that are actually coming in.  In real time.  SOmeone in the class may say 'hey, what about this?' and we can actually go.  Oh...  Yeah...  Maybe.  We never thought of that...  And that could actually factor in to better healthcare for the patient.</p>

                            <p>But this assumes we are actually trying to help people.  Die!  Die!!! Die!!! So that I can be only person on payroll at age of 85..  All y'all can die!  Die!! Die!!! It's soooooooooooo competitive.  PS don't forget to pay the 'university'.</p>

                            <p>Oh my... So now we have 3 psychiatrists (for example) for 1 FTE (where we only had 1 before).  What does that mean?  Well...  I heard something about...  1 person actually in the hospital.  1 person on call for a consult.  So the person in the hospital can obtain a second opinion from a peer.  Suitably knowledgeable other.  Another person is not on call.  Is doing what they need to do to look after themself.  Look after their basic needs.  SO they can rotate into postion in due course.</p>

                            <p>But no  no no no no no no there simply can't be 3 psychiatrists sharing 1 FTE.  It's sooooooooooo competitive.  Clearly teh aim of the game is to eliminate the competition and get paid 3xFTE all for oneself...  I can be 1FTE teaching and 1FTE research and 1FTE clinical practice.  Also 1FTE as judge 1FTE as jury and 1FTE as executioner.  I can old 1FTE portfolio and another 1FTE portfolio.  I can be minister of everything and all things to all men!!!! I can have millions and millions of dollars of income for myself when I never studied finance or anything and I have no knowledge or abiltity to share that money around..  That makes me winner!  Like oscar the grouch head of the rubbish heap!!! Go me!!!!</p>
