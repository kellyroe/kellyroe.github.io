 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/politics/lawyers-looking-after-lawyers-panel-says-strip-law-society-of-powers-to-discipline/  The Law Society is not upholding professional standards.  Not any more than the Justices are upholding Justice.  I mean, what do you expect?  Una Jagose thinking the function of Crown Law is to close ranks about and protect the crimes of the Crown, and all. </p> 
                                <p>There was a particular Professor who was going along to the law camps at Otago trying to teach the second year law students about appropriate conduct, or whatever.  When they started saying that behavior at the camps was inappropriate -- they then redeployed him to Auckland.  He's a law Professor at the University of Auckland now, isn't he?  That was his promotion.  As Dr Leeks was promoted to Melbourne, this guy was promoted to Auckland.  If you put in an OIA for information they should be required to tell you how much increase of public salary he is paid now (as Professsor in Auckland rather than Dunedin) as...  How are we supposed to think of it?  As a reward for his many  years of building the Dunedin law camp into everything it became?</p>

                                <p>New Zealand and Australia undermine themselves.  They won't get students work to external examiners so that it can be externally examined on it's academic merits.  They aren't even pretending to be academic institutions concerned with academic merits.  They aren't processing applications to enrol, progressions through training, qualification completions properly, much of the time.  They aren't advertising jobs, selecting from applicants on the basis of skills and experience, paying them properly.  They aren't doing anything properly.  They just redeploy people into position so they can ensure that the job for which they are paid is not actually performed by anybody at all.  There is nothing here.  </p>

                                <p>The leaders apparently choose (exerting their own soverignty) to run Australasia like a slave, prison, or detention camp.  They aren't at all even trying to be fair.  No conception of fairness, even.  Lacking the cognitive capacity.  It's all sooooooo competitive.  It's soooooo competitive that they throw applications away and refuse to get work to externals and refuse to graduate so that we are left with the 'only game in town' and 'there was no alternative'.</p>


                                <p>The leaders of NZ have never been known or regarded as intellectuals.  They have always been regarded as anti-intellectuals.  The least well educated civil service and government in the world.  Not just because we refuse to allow the education system to develop (e.g., refuse to build 3 year degrees into 4 year degrees, refuse to build 5 year PhD's from 3 year PhD's.  Refuse to develop the teaching curriculum.  Refuse to develop course contents.  Refuse to teach and externally examine course contents.  Refuse to allow new research to see the light of day.  Function as a prison slave or detention camp.  Simply refusing to graduate students).  The government preferentially hired graduates after 3 or 4 years of university study (only) to the civil service.  Preferring them to be younger and less knowledgeable and less experienced.  Preferring them to be the chidren of those already employed thinking they most likely to work to cover up the crimes of their forefathers.  The idea was that they needed the Ministers to be able to understnd the reports.  They couldn't rely on the reading age or comprehension of the ministers being much more than them being able to read the abstract or table of contents.  So the reports say the same thing over and over and over and over and over.  So the Ministers don't need to read the reports.  The reports can only say what the Ministers said already so that the Ministers can claim to understand the reports.   </p>

                                <p>This preference for the youngest and stupidist being the most desirable.  The most 'trainable'.  To make the senior people feel competent.  To work to cover up their crimes only.  Great way to run a country..  Into the ground.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>People come back from overseas with knowledge and skills and the leaders from here refuse to acknowledge them or allow them to function or contribute.  Because the f*cking stupid is too f*cking stupid.  And they know it.  They never would have been appointed into position if they had have been anything else.  Intentionally deployed to ensure the prevention and prohibition of development in the slave colony prison camp detention facility lands.  Not even trying to develop.  Everything they can to prevent and prohibit it and follow as slowly behind dragging the heels every step of the way.  Retard-land.  People kept retarded.  There is nothing here.</p>

                                <p>There aren't any universities because they aren't processing the applications to enrol properly.  They aren't progressing people through their qualifications.  They aren't graduating all and only the people who did the work they were supposed to for the qualification.  They aren't paying the workers.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>What is a GP supposed to do, exactly?  Let's have a think about that, so we can understand why it is desirable to pick out teengers when they are 18 for that one.  Firstly, they say 'we will get an assistant to the nurses assistant to take a sample and send it to the labs' because you can't diagnose very many things without pathology reports.  Secondly, they say 'it is probably a virus therefore there is nothing we can do so no antibiotics for you go way' (that was a big one, prior to 2018).  Thirdly, they say 'hmm.  We better watch and wait and see what happens.  Come back to me again if things get worse'.  That way they get more money for repeat visits, at least.  Fourthly, they say 'go to the ED'.  Fifthly, they say 'that's outside my scope of practice so I'll put you on the waitlist to see a specialist'.  What else does a GP do, in NZ?  The assistant to the nurses assistant (likely the unpaid student doing their internship) does the blood pressure and so on.  So what are GPs for, exactly?  What is it that they do?  Aside from telling people that healthcare is not for them by delay delay delay delay until they die, of course.  Which is basically the same function as the judiciary.  And basically everything else in NZ.</p>

                                <p>My understanding was that the reason why a lot of Medical Graduates (though, not sure that there are any, anymore) did not want to do GP specialist training and work as a GP was because.  Well, firstly you have to be accepted to study with the GP people.  They don't seem to have exams that can be studied for, exactly.  I don't know how they pick who gets to train with them.  Their children are likely to cover for them, I suppose, but aside from them...  So there isn't really much in the way of curriculum contents or external exams.  So then you are, um...  Hostage?  Do we call it?  To the people who are supposed to  be training you.  What do they do with you?  Put you to work for low levels of pay (you pay them for being a student) and they refuse to sign you off because then you would have to be paid more but they don't want you to be paid they want themselves to be paid and it's sooooooo competitive.  So they aren't going to sign you off.  You can do all of the work and they will collect all of the pay.  Maybe one day, when they turn 90 or 120 they will die and then you can replace them and keep your own slaves for the remainder of your life.  They'll have to die before there would be a job for you!  It's sooooooooo competitive!!!  </p>

                                <p>Of course there is a lot more that GPs could be doing.  For example, our death by skin cancer rates are really high, and most people in NZ don't have regular physical exams.  For all the non-consenting groping that the medical studnets are expected to do and the liberties they are expected to take once people have been anesthetised for unrelated procedures there is actually a dearth of competent physical health checkups.  The basic lack of medical check ups and preventative care and so on.  I suppose that's because we don't actually want the people to live.  It's soooooooo competitive, and all.</p>

                                <p>Is someone really doing their PhD thesis on attachment and how people attach to cats, or similar?  Who is supervising that one?  I'm curious because I was interested in psychoanalytic / dynamic / attachment stuff for a while there and I didn't see any university academics in NZ doing any research along the lines of any of that.  It surprises me that there would be.  We are basically doing 'Brave New World' types of interventions trying to breed or raise a slave class of Gamma babies by design.  Raising them in Fisher and Paykal incubators.  After having induced premature delivery in the name of 'for their own good' so as to interrupt attachment.  Sort of raise them as Harry Harlow primate research laboratory babies.  Run this social engineering experiment out of New Zealand.  Of course.  So the graduates from Harvard can come visit and see how the Harry Harlow primates are doing and see Rheumatic Fever in the wild etc.  Are our leaders really too stupid to see any of this for what it is?  Too stupid by design?  Una Jagose tells you everything you need to know about NZs attitude to this kind of thing.  Easier to conceal it (easier to work to undermine the public interest) if people from NZ aren't allowed to study attachment and so on.  So the judges can order the babies to be kept on incubators and the mothers to be imprisoned for the babies own good (and not because of the perversions of the likes of Dr Leeks).  Yeah, right.  </p>

                                <p>Attachment, yes..  Indeed...  Also projection.  People sometimes project stuff onto an external object.  Stuff they don't know how to metabolise otherwise.  By projecting it externally they can consider it more objectively.  Like that advertisement there used to be on TV about the snowball that gets bigger and bigger and then they show someone holding it in the palm of their hand.  Perspective.  Um...  You did call the cat fleabus.  The cat didn't choose her name.  But she's kind of the repository for all the angsty feelings, I suppose.  The gripes and so on.  I don't know how you can let a cat who has scratched your face anywhere near your face, again.  I mean you can love her, but also know not to trust her near your face.  Not let her in the room while you are sleeping etc.  But the will to live.  I hear you.  Many people do.  It's sooooo competitive.  I hear that many of the Jewish people weren't actually killed by Nazis.  They weren't following orders or instructions to go off into the gas chambers.  They were walking under their own volition.  They were voluntary-like.  I'm sure that's how our government would see such things.  All the students who voluntarily choose to drop out of graduate research programmes when it is time for their thesis to go out to external examiners.  Particularly when they have supplied evidence to the administration of having written an appropriate length document.  They just voluntarily choose to walk away.  The medical studnets who apparently chose to not attend their workplace internships at the end of their training.  They voluntarily chose not to attend their internships that the university had set up for them to go on.  They did not actually want to do supervised work for the job that they'd trained.  Yeah, right.  So the University refused to sign off on their qualification completion and said they needed to do their internship again, in NZ.  Work the job for low to no pay while they paid the university, I mean to say.</p>

                                <p>Apparently some law guy had to...  Sue someone?  Because 18 months after he graduted from Law School they are refusing to allow him to work as a lawyer unsupervised.  But who will supervise the graduate lawyers?  Nobody who would ever acknowledge they were competent.  Because, if they were competent, people might then choose to pay them instead of their supervisor.  The supervisor is likely soooooo competitive about their income that they aren't going to want to sign off on a potential competitor.  Right?  Why would the university academics ever want to see their studnet signed off as having completed their PhD work?  Then they would apply for research funding.  But that all belongs to the supervisor.  Right?  The student slave is supposed to not be capable of functioning independently.  The money has to go to the supervisor.  Trickle down economics means the supervisor gets to piss all over the studnets.  Particularly the ones who are capable of functioning independently.  There will be a job for htem over the supervisors dead body, of course!  Alllllll of the research monies for them and people who don't appear to be willing or able to function independently.  </p>

                                <p>The issue with the courts of NZ is that they are not awardings costs properly.  To say nothing of legal fees.  I mean to say they are not awarding any of that properly.  To say nothing of damages.  Actual meaningful levels of compensation.  They are stuck into the trickle down economics mentality or mindset, too, where the aim is to use the law as a weapon wielded by the government against the people of NZ.  Right?  That's the function of the Judiciary, wouldn't you say, Una?</p>

                                <p>I don't often agree with Mike Hosking,  but he's an interesting starting point to bounce off what I think, on some issues.  Is he a-political?  I don't think he is.  I think he's fairly supportive of National vs Labor...  I think that's sometihng fairly apparent.  That could be figured out on the basis of his point of view.  That he was picked out to speak to that demographic.  For them to resonate with.  That's fine.  Just so long as he's not the only game in town and there are other figures or people who are similarly speaking for other points of view.  In fact, that actually makes for interesting dialogue and so on.  Different positions and points of view.  Anyway, the point is, that Mike Hosking wrote (else someone else wrote and attributed to him) that the health system has fallen apart under Labor and things were tight under National.  The reporting of national health statistics.  How many people were presenting to the ED and so on.  But the thing is, that under the National Government things were so very very oppressive that nobody was speaking out.  People were too afraid.  People have started speaking out more now.  I mean to say, once you move from caring about the perception of corruption to actual corruption then the first thing that will happen is that there will appear to be more corruption about as we start facing up to the problem instead of pretending that we can't see it.  So, things seeming to be a bit worse doesn't necessariliy indicate that things actually are worse.  </p>

                                <p>In 2018 I wrote about the ED wait list times and how the DHB's were fudging those (some of how they were fudging those) which is of course obvious to anybody with half a brain.  If you want the actual numbers that are presenting.  Well, there are walk-ins and there are ambulance arrivals.  The ambulances are all managed, logistically, out of Christchurch.  Have been for quite some time.  The people who tell what ambulances to go where and take the people from there to whereever else.  Take them to the after hours A and E clinic rather than to the hospital.  Keep them in the back of your ambulance.  Take them to this particular hospital. That has been centrally manged from Christchurch for quite some time.  I don't know why they are suggesting, now, that diverting ambulances to particular hospitals (or away from hospitals altogether) is something new.  The patinet flow thing would be obvious to anybody who had ever actually been to the ED.  What they do, there, with moving you from the central area into a particular room to wait in until someone who is going to pretend (at least) to be a doctor sees you.  The A and E does that, too.  At least, the Angelsea clinic used to.  They would move people from the central waiting area into a consultation room.  Then you would wait in the consultation room for another hour or more, sometimes.  They would actually leave you in the unstaffed consultation room with piles of unfilled prescsription pads sitting in plain view, often.  Unclear to me why.  Maybe thinking that peple might just take the pads and scram.  They could clear the patient load in that way.  But that was the Angelsea Clinic.  That was a...  Let's see...  Shareholders Clinic?  Various GPs in Hamilton brought shares in it and were expected to work in it for however many hours per month, or similar.  I don't think they were even properly staffing that...  And it used to cost...  Was it $80 to see a doctor after 10pm.  And the public ambulances would be told to divert ambulances to that clinic.  The people from Christchurch would tell them to do that.  To manage the patient flow, or similar. </p>

                                <p>How much money was Kim Sterelny paid by the Australian National University to supervise my research during my PhD candidature?  Why didn't he get me any comments on my writing?  Why didn't he meet with me?  Apparently I have no proof or evidence that he didn't.  I can't supply evidence that he didn't -- but what is relevant is that he can't supply evidence that he did.  Check his email inbox for work that I sent him.  Check his email outbox for supervision or meetings he set up with me.  You will see that I did my work and he did not do the job for which he was paid.  The University administration has documented that I supplied them with a table of contents asserting I had written more than 100,000 words on a thesis document.  They never sent me a reminder or information as to what I needed to do to get that to external examiners.  They never sent it out for external examination.  They never did the job for which they were paid.</p>

                                <p>How much money did the University of Waikato get for having me enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled in a 120 point MPhil thesis.  I applied to be enrolled in a 120 point MPhil thesis.  I did not apply to be enrolled in a 240 or 360 point MPhil thesis.  They refused to get my work to external examiners with instructions for them to examine it for the qualification that I applied to be enrolled in.  THey refused to do the job for which they were paid.  </p>

                                <p>All these people on payroll who refuse to do the job for which they are paid.  Maybe they are incompetent.  Inept.  Can't do it.  So the government keeps me on disability 'supported living payment' (sounds kind of like 'life support' haha) while paying these people hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to keep slaves.  All the work I did and they refused to pay me for any of it.  It costs them nothing to acknowledge that I'd done enough for completion of the qualification.  It costs them nothing.  It is not about the money.    </p>

                                <p>What was Justine Kingsbury's research output for 2018?  She was paid, as a university academic, to have the primary function of producing a research output.  Where is it?  She thinks I did not produce enoguh in the 2018 acadmeic year for credit for a 120 point qualification.  I am asking to see the work she did for her tenured position as a philosophy academic.  Where is her research output?  WHere is her evidence of supervising me in 2018?  Where is her evidence of having helped me complete the qualification in a timely fashion?</p>

                                <p>They aren't universities.  They are keeping slaves.  They aren't paying the workers.  People contract to do work in exhange for it going to be externally examined for the qualification and they aren't having the work externally examined.  I know that they are saying that other studnets graduated from the qualification (ANU is anyway, not sure that Waikato is graduating research students at all).  But I don't know whether their theses ever go out to externls or whether it is that some peoples parents pay exhorbitant bribes or similar.  Auckland University wants to assert to the courts that they have authority to refuse to acknowledge a NZ University qualification that was completed more than 5 years ago.  So that tells you what the Univesrity of Auckland thinks of the value of NZ University qualifications.  Of course people with NZ University qualifications that expired more than 5 years ago include the Judges and so on.  But then apparently Auckland UNi just hired Ashley Bloomfield as Professor and he doesn't have a PhD or an MD (he does not have a research doctoral qualifiation), he never applied to be enrolled in one, never wrote one.  He does not have a research output.  The anti-intellectual politicians want to declare themselves head of the university now.  They think that makes them intellectuals?  Jacinda Ardern is an intellectual now with her honorary degree?  She's having things published about her contribution to the fashion world, or something...  </p>

                                <p>There isn't an actual university.  It got overtaken by psychopaths.  By design. I think it was a ploy to drive up private school prices in the US.  By undermining Australasian Public Universities the likes of Ashley Bloomfield takes up all the Professorships for himself while sending his kids off to Harvard, I suppose.  I wonder what you have to do to graduate with your cohort from Harvard?  Apparently the State University of NY gets about 30,000 applications to enrol every year.  It is $80 to apply to enrol there, isn't it?  The application fee?  That is quite the money earner for the University.  Then I suppose there is an 'application to graduate' fee and so on and so on and so forth.  Corruption, hey.  Once you take into account the number of people, then, who are handed or given Degrees who didn't earn them in fact then the whole thing becomes entirely meaningless.  Did any of the ANU studnets have their theses externally examined?  I remember people saying they did 'everything their supervisor asked of them' (as did I) and the externals accepted their thesis without any requests for changes, at all.  Does that sound plausible to you?  That an external examiner (who was independent from the production process) isn't going to suggest a typo or grammatical alteration?  Isn't going to suggest a reference somewhere? A restruture there?  Isn't going to want to put their mark on it, somehow?  Feel like they are a part of it if it is to be accepted at all?  An external examiner isn't going to want to piss on a corner of it, so to speak?  An external examiner isn't going to want to feel like they made it better?  Does it really seem plausible that an external examiner is simply going to accept it without grabbing the opportunity to have the studnet run through a few more hoops...  Delay procrastinate etc?  Is that really plausible?  It sounds off, to me.  It makes me wonder if the work was never actually sent out to external examiners at all.  The University simply decided to say that it had been accepted and hand over the Degree.  How do they decide which studnets get given that royal treatment?  I'm not sure.  Maybe the ones who are not willing or able to function independently?  I don't know...  All I do know is that my work was never sent out to externals and now, the University is more interested in defending or asserting their entitltement that they don't have to.  They can do anyting anything you like and you and whose army is going to do wha about that?  Because it's soooooooooo competitive.</p>
