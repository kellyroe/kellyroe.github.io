I'm sure the 'judge technologist' couldn't have seen things any other way.  Nobody else applied to be a `judge technologist' - but even if they did.  Only the pedophile liar would ever have graduated into that position  - don't you think?  Evidence to the contrary???  It is not like I'm not looking for evidence to dis-confirm the most obvious of beliefs.  Am I right???  Must be...  Hur.  Who wants to move to NZL?  All voluntary-like.  On the basis of what it is that they see.  Yeah, right.  We don't have any doctors, lawyers, engineers.  The early people arrived here and looked at the `other' and at them selves (in the mirror) and no people did they see.  Real land of opportunity.  Terra Nullus.  There aren't any people here.  Not so far as anybody can see... </p>

                            <p>Q:  Do you think that Hitler (for example) thought that he was a 'game changer'?  </p>

                            <p>Q:  How many people want to play his game?</p>

                            <p>It is soooooooooooooooooo competitive.  The people will do anything anything anything everything everything...  Just to meet minimum wage.   No? Uh... Just not to be marched off to the death camps.  The `prison' or `hospital' or `education' government institutions...  Not to be marched off to the death camps...</p>

                                There is a link to my CV that I have presently under consideration for various things.  I am in the transferring things into a new file format and merging smaller pieces into collections (so you can get a sense of my standard or normal work output per year).  I'll try not to break the above links in my CV in the process.

                <p>The above was supplied to my supervisor and the table of contents (together with a chapter word count totaling more than 100,000 words) was supplied to the ANU administration at a point in time when they had me enrolled in the PhD programme.  I am still waiting for them to supply me with the reports from external examiners.  I am still waiting for them to schedule an oral defence or examination where I can respond to the externals reports etc.  The whole time I was at the ANU I did not see any doctoral students with reports from external examiners.  I did not see any doctoral students with publically scheduled oral examinations or defences.   How are others claiming to have graduated from their doctoral programme?  I really don't understand.</p>

                <p>What education and training system?</p>

                <p>The psychoanalytic schools don't exist anymore.  Apparently, the way the story goes, they went extinct.  Apoptosed.  All voluntary-like.  How so?  Well, they stopped graduating people from their training programmes.  I think that was it.  In order to be declared graduated from the training programme you were declared to have completed or finished a course of their own therapy.  But instead of their own therapy working towards a conclusion or an end point where people were declared graduated, instead what happened was that they worked only to keep people dependent.  Re re re re re enrolled in their courses or programmes of therapy.  </p>

                <p>I was wondering how the `University' of Waikato was going to staff their medical school.  They are taking the people from the Waikato Institute of Technology  - particularly the ones who were involved in re re re re re enrolling the nursing students in nursing programmes.  Refusing to sign them off.  Allowing them subsistence wages (at times) as minimum wage `healthcare assistants' while they be re re re re re enrolled in their nursing qualifications.  THey are going to take those people and employ them in the `University' to take re re re re re enrolments (particularly international studnet fees, no doubt) to keep studnets re re re re re enrolled in the medical programme.  They can pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the `University' (only ever have increasing levels of debt recorded against their name with the IRD for their re re re re enrolment) while they are put to unpaid work as `interns'.  </p>

                <p>How is it that they start out with thousands of medical students (NZ does) and end up with..  How many graduates of the medical schools, every year?  Apparently it's so competitive and they can't replace a student they have removed.  I mean to say if they bully a 6th year student into fleeing then they don't have to worry about the 6th year student being replaced by anybody else.  </p>

                <p>What is the aim point purpose or goal?  Seems to be the controlled populations.  Look at what they are studying.  Maleria or cancer or whatever.  The idea is to keep however many people with maleria or cancer or whatever for the duration of the study.  Some of them will be in the control group (to be kept with the maleria or the cancer or whatever) and some of them will be in other groups (to be kept with the malaeria or the cancer or whatever - along with something else, maybe a dose of an experimental vaccine or preventative or whatever).  The only thing that's constant is that the `gold standard' requires however many people to be kept with maleria or cancer or whatever for the duration of the trial in order not to violate the integrity of the study.  That's the proper object of our concern when it comes to integrrity.  Say the only people who get to decide the methodology that we value most highly.  The one that involves the most controlled populations.  Of course.  We must keep populations of people in controlled conditions where they have maleria and cancer and so on.  In the name of medical research!  It's all to prevent and prohibit far far far worse atrocities!  Yeah, right.</p>

                <p>Why is it that they are so focussed on taking 18 year olds into their training programme?  Why so many camping trips?  What kind or sort of education and training system is that ffs?</p>

                <p>So we don't seem to have any doctors or lawyers.  No judges.  Teachers.  No skilled laborers.  No engineers.  They won't acknowledge that people who have completed the programme have completed the programme.  They won't do it.  And they hand out honorary degrees and honorarary positions and the like to people who never applied to the programme.  Who never did the work for it.  Ones who couldn't do an oral defence (it would be obvious they didn't know what they were talking about or they couldn't explain it or they weren't the author of it) so no oral defences will be scheduled.  What education and training system?  DOn't you want to go to school to eat your lunch with the best and the brightest?  So motivating and inspiring they are.  Having killed off the best and the brightest because there was no way they would have been appointed into their positions if they hadn't.  Don't you want to join them?  Or maybe  you just wait to be re-deployed into the position.  What kind of education and training programme could there possibly be that allegedly hires Ashley Bloomfield to be professor (never applied to do MD or PhD, never did the work for that qualification, never had reports from externals or an oral defence, doesn't have a portfolio of research output.  Or maybe Jacinda Ardern.  Apparently she's going to write a book one day.  Oh.  It wasn't that she wrote 50,000 - 100,000 words per year for 7-8 years.  We'll just give her a doctorate all honorary-like and fellowships all honorary-like and see how many international students will pay and pay and pay and pay and pay to have a little yakkity yak yak to Jacinda.  Seriously?  What a f*cking joke of a farce of a scummy scummy scam.</p>

                <p>Not even trying to be fair.  There's really nothing there.  THe leaders choose to govern like it's the Stanford Prison Experiment and they were appointed to lead beecause they dont' know how lucky they are!  It's all very random and very very divisive.  THey choose to lead like it's a prison slave or detention facility.  They wouldn't have  been appointed any other way, they say.  That's supposed to indicate to them that it's time for them to get out.  They never would have been appointed by proper process and proper process was not followed.  Not even trying to be rule by law.  No conception of what that even means.  I guess nobody applied to be enrolled in law.   Nobody graduated.  Nobody wanted to be judge.  Have to pull Judges from retirement (past compulsory age of retirement) and re-appoint them to office to not see anything wrong.  What's the worst that can happen to them?  Removal from office?  I suppose the ideology is to make criminals of us all.  See who has the balls to off them, them.  They would have things no other way.  There will be a job for someone else only over their dead bodies.  They would have things no other way.  They look younger and younger every year, often.  It's like their great great grandchildren keep control of their bank account and simply take over their identities.  Pass themselves off as.  I guess that used to be a bit prohibitive for daughters.  But not so now with the changing people's sex on their birth certificate, I suppose.  All voluntary-like, of course.  You have been volunteered.  What part of you have been consented is so hard for you to understand?  What education and training system?  They won't pay the workers.  There's nothing there.  What a scummy scummy scam.</p>
