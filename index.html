                            <article>

                            <p>
                            I was born in NZ.  I studied Philosophy and Psychology at the University of Waikato.  I did more than 120 points in my first year (including summer school).  My second year I was given compassionate withdrawal from the first semester (even though I was on track for very high passes for all my courses) as my brother died <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/canyon-tragedy-trial-waste-of-time-says-victims-father/YVO43OPH7Z4G4KKHBCICRHALJU/">canyoning in switzerland</a> and <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/two-kiwis-in-alps-death-toll-of-18/6EARKQ3EKJBL255POLRHFOUN2Y/"> it was a difficult time.</a>  <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/swiss-flood-victim-laid-to-rest/UW4HK5BMRKKRUPPGHP6ZTOMQFE/"> I think they gave him an honorary degree because he died before graduation.</a>
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I tried to go back to Univeristy too soon and I think I had another lot of compassionate withdrawals for a semester -- even though, again, I was on track to pass all my courses.  I was having problems obtaining suitable housing, too.  I spend some time in the Henry Bennett Centre.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            A couple years later I enrolled part time (2 courses per semester and a summer school course).  Then I did more than 120 points (with 9 courses, again) my third and final year of my BA.  I completed my Honors year with more than 120 points in that year.  So I completed my BA and BA(hons) over 3 full time years (where I did 9  more than 120 points each of those years maxing out summer school) and 1 part-time year.  I was able to complete the 4 year Degre programme in 3 full time years and 1 part time year  because of the way I distributed my workload.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I wanted to study my PhD in the USA because I liked the sound of the 5 year PhD system where you do 2 years of course-work and develop rapport with the people on staff before writing a 3 year PhD.  I felt that philosophy was a very broad subject and there were areas of philosophy that I didn't know anything about.  I wanted to learn more and have a breadth to my education before doing more research in a more specialised area.  I thought it was important to go to graduate school somewhere different from where you went to undergraduate school.
                            </p>

                            <p>I got a Summer Research Scholarship to the Australian National University.  Professor Martin Davies seemed happy with the work that I had done for him over the summer.  He said that he would put in a good work for me applying to the ANU to do a PhD but he declined to write me a reference for USA PhD programmes.  He told me not to apply to both USA and Australia at the same time because the way funding rounds worked.  He said that if I accepted an offer from Australia and then heard back from the USA if I told Australia I was no longer taking up the Australian place then the Australian place would be down one student and would miss out on funding for a student for that year.  So, if I wanted to apply to the USA then I should hold off applying to Australia for another year.  I didn't want to leave the ANU out of pocket so I took his advice to hold off applying to Australia for a year because I wanted to do a 5 year programme.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            My applications to MIT and Cornell were unsuccessful.  
                            The University of Waikato encouraged me to stick around there for another year while I applied to Australia.  They said there was no problem, at all, with me working on my 120 point MA thesis for another year.  The MA thesis only programme (for studnets who had completed honors in the subject already) was a 120 point programme of study.  Since I worked on it for 2 academic years (and one summer school period) 120 points over that length of time means the MA thesis was completed on a part-time basis.  Less than 1/2 time basis, actually.  It does not count towards my full-time GPA because it is not fair to expect studnets to produce work of that quality in their 120 point, 1 year enrolments.  For the record I was given an 'A' grade and told I didn't get an A+ because it contained typographical errors.  I don't know what people think is fair, about that.  Is it reasonable to expect ones supervisor to read a draft to help ensure there are no typos in the final?  Or is the student responsible for running it by university editing services?  I think the supervisor is responsible for telling the student that they may be penalised if there are typos, at least.  I'm not sure what the University does with the money they get to supervise the student when the supervisor can't even help ensure no typographical errors on a submitted thesis.
                            </p>

                            <p>I did not know that some people have (are encouraged to have) an attitude whereby the main aim or goal or purpose or point is to race your way to PhD or 'doctor' status before you turn 25.  I did not know that students would be more interested in, for example, enrolling in a 3 year PhD programme immediately after their honors year (if they had the gradest to do that -- which I did).  I wanted to learn more.  I suppose I thought that I was investing in my future.  Not chasing the money.  Trying to learn more.  Longer term.  I don't know at what point people were just taking me for a fool.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Professor Martin Davies had left the ANU for Oxford before I started my PhD with the ANU in 2006. I have asked the ANU for my student records.  So I can see what they have recorded about my 6 monthly progress and my mid-term review.  I have posted my work I was doing over that time on the seminars and writing page of this site.  I was granted a VC travel scholarship so as to put my PhD enrolment on hold for 1 academic year.  I was able to use the funding to travel to the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill for 1 academic year as a visiting scholar.  In exhange for tutoring and grading 1 course per semester (what their graduate students are expected to do) they put me on the equivalent of a graduate student stipend.  That meant I could audit (attend for non-credit) PhD level courses at the UNC, Chapel Hill and neighbouring Duke University.  I was very pleased to have the opportunity to take courses in areas of Philosophy and Cognitive Neuroscience at PhD level.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            On my return to ANU something happened around my mid-term review.  I wasn't allowed to give it before I left...  Anyway...  I ended up leaving the University without having submited a thesis for examination.  I left the University not wanting to do any more work in Philosophy.  I wasn't entirely sure what I was going to do.  I guess I thought I would go to Wellington and try and get an entry level Government Job as a Policy Advisor or Analyst, or something, on the back of my MA.  I tried to do that for around a year and nothing was coming through for me.  No work.  So I inquired into returning to University study.  Then I started looking into Medicine, particularly, and whether I could pursue entering into that programme.  Work and Income (Ministry of Social Development) seemed supportive about my doing that.  Student Loans were approved.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I then found myself being failed for First Year courses.  For example, being repeatedly failed for first year population health essays (so I was informed I was 'ineligible to apply' to Medicine).  I asked about whether completing a 120 point MPhil from Waikato would be enough for me to be eligible to apply (my GPA would come from my  undergrad and honors full time years) and they agreed to that.  But then Waikato refused to enrol me in the course I applied to by the application deadline.  They enrolled me in courses I never applied to.  They informed me I could not complete the qualification in the normal time for a 120 point qualification.  They refused to get my work to external examiners.  They sent the under 50,000 word Masters thesis out to be examined for PhD (so it could only be found by externals to come up short).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I don't know how much it is a personal thing against me.  They knew I wanted to complete it in order to do Medicine.  I don't know how much they refused to allow me to complete it because they had something personal against me.  I think New Zealand Universities, generally, are not allowing students to complete graduate research qualifications, particularly, in the time they are supposed to be completed.  They are big about allowing people to have extensions and so on,  but the reality seems to be that they believe they are entitled to force people to take out extensions.  I think something dodgey in going on with them double-billing for students.  I think there is something like that going on.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I exhausted internal complaints resolution process and it seemed to me that the Universities were only obstructive.  They thought the purpose or point of the internal complaints resolution process was to bully the studnet into shutting up.  The VC of Waikato advised me to take them to court via judicial review of administrative action if I didn't think that how they treated my enrolment in 2018 and 2019 was lawful.  So I did that.  The Judges seem to think that the piont of legal process is to bully the applicant into shutting up, again.  I have posted some of my filings here because it seems to me that justice has not been done by the courts.  It is now 2022.  They say 'justice delayed is justice denied'.  The courts are denyign me justice.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I have recently asked the ANU for my student records so I can see what went wrong with my PhD and see if it is possible for them to get my work to externals (bundle it up, or something) and see if I've done enough for a PhD yet.  They should have records of my progress at the 6 monthly mark, the mid-term mark.  They should have records of my progress when they chose to give me a travel scholarship and support me in going to the USA.  Presumably they wouldn't have given me the award if they felt I was floundering or a weak studnet.  I want to see evidence of my supervision and I want to see what was said about my submission date.  I was granted 1 extra year of funding (for a total of 4 years living stipend).  So there was enough progress for them at the 3 year marks to approve another year of funding.  So, then, what happened?  I have uploaded a more than 100,000 word document that I supplied to Kim Sterelny before I left Australia.  I don't know why that wasn't given to externals.
                            </p>

                            <p>I thought...  My understanding was that it was reasonable to believe that a PhD from the ANU would make it likely that I would end up with post-docs and / or a tenured position as a philosophy acadaemic.  That seems to be what happens to most of their graduates.  Maybe not so much their New Zealand Graduates.  They used to be able to get Australian Government jobs, but then Australia stopped that.  Because NZ was complaining about the brain drain.  Australia taking all the grads.  So Australia stopped taking the grads into government.  So that NZ could hire them, then.  Only NZ won't hire them.  So...  So I guess there isn't any point Australia giving NZ students PhD's even.  Because NZ will never hire them.  But will complain about them having taken the student.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            When you have a job with a University usually you can take courses with the University without paying.  So, on the back of a job in a University I could have taken courses while earning a paycheck.  I thought...  I thought I was making an investment or sacrifice.  Instead of an employed position (with study as a hobby that I didn't have to pay for and with a paycheck as well) I was choosing to be a fairly poor studnet living fairly minimally for a few more years yet, in the hope that I would get to study Medicine.  I was working towards that.  Following their advice on how you earn entry to Medicine in NZ.  They wanted me to do a 120 point research project in Philosophy.  That should have been easy.  I had a reason to get the work in by the deadline.  I knew that supervisors in Australasia are not forthcoming about your deadline.  I mean, as an undergrad I was given deadlines on when my work was due.  And I submitted it on time and there never was any problem.  Then you get to graduate school and even if (as in this last time) you are upfront about asking when you need to get the thesis in by they just won't agree to anything.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            They say that the programme is 1 year.  So they say you need to labor for 12 months before submitting your work for a 3 month external examination.  They also say that in the case of MPhil or PhD examination the outcome of what they will call 'first examination' is that you have to re-enrol and keep working for another 6 months before submitting your thesis again.  Then there is another 3 months of external examination.  And now the most likely outcome depends a bit on the NZ University.  Waikato has up to 10 weeks for changes to the substance to be made.  So that's 1 year plus 6 months extra work plus 3x2=6 months external exam and another 2 1/2 months.  So that's more than 24 months of work for a 120 point qualification.  So that's forcing students (as a matter of course) to part-time status.  My evidence for this is here:
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications.  They define a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a> 
                            </p>

                        <p>It has  been since my legal proceedings that the law has  been changed to explicitly mention 2 things.  Firstly, that the University has fiduciary duty to students.  That is to say, the point of the University supervisor etc is not to fail the student.  It is not to stabotage or undermine or obstruct or prevent or prohibit.  It is to help the student complete the work.  The second is that the University does not get to force students to labor with only part time credit.  There are discrepancies in their billing and invoicing practices.  Around the fees that they are obtaining in forcing re-enrolments.  It seems to me that they are double-invoicing the government for having students.  It seems to me that the law change (particularly around not forcing students to work for part-time credit) has been a response to what happened with me.  But there has not been any justice for me.
                        </p>

                        <p>I completed a 120 point MPhil for Waikato in 2018.  I understand that various people do not like things that I said in my thesis.  They don't need to like it, however.  They needed to get the thesis and the sign off forms to the externals and ALLOW the externals to sign off on it being enough for 120 points credit.  And they just refused to do that.  They wasted my time and they invoiced me and the goverment for more than they were entitled to.  They did this intentionally to stabotage my application to Medicine.  But I supplied Auckland with all the information that I had done everything that was required of me to have compeleted a 120 point programme of study in the 'minimum normal or standard time' as they (unlawfully) required for eligibility (since they don't get to set eligibiliyt criteiron for domestic adults).  They are required to follow their selection algorithm that they publsihed for hte purpose of accountability insofar as the selection algorithm is lawful.  They refuse to follow their own selection algorithm.  They refuse to correctly enter my GPA.  They are not beign fair as to how they are selecting students to study Medicine.  The courts are not holding them accountable to the people of New Zealand. 
                        </p>

                        <p>Justice delayed is justice denied.  They are denying me justice.  Compounding the injustice the more weeks months years this whole thing drags out.  I make my filings available so as to help international community make informed decisions on how to do / what kind of business they can do with New Zealand.  People need to be warned that they are not behaving lawfully and the courts of New Zealanad are not holding them to account.  It is particularly frightening when we hear about people like Dr Leeks and realise that he wasn't the product of a selection algorithm.  He was hand-picked for whatever qualities they value.  They aren't selecting people from their algorithm.  And look at the people they choose.  People who are ethically problematic (to say the least).  To abuse New Zealanders in the detention camps of New Zealand.  I appreciate they are trying ot build new buildings that are fit for purpose. I appreciate they are changing laws (e.g., decriminalising abortion so you don't need psychiatry sign-off so psychiatrists don't need to sign-off on abortions on mental health grounds all day).  But there has not been any justice, for me.
                        </p>


                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  You can judge for yourself whether I am bringing a case of public interest before the courts, and whether Otago should be held accountable for refusing to supply applications, refusing to process applications, and for removing applications from the applicant pool prior to merit-based selection.  They collect up information about disability prior to selection for the explicit purpose of excluding otherwise qualified candidates.  The courts refuse to rule that discrimination against people on the basis of disability is unlawful. 
                            </p>


                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings on grounds that it had already passed judgment on the filings and would not revisit the issue.  They did not think my filings sufficient to show there had been a grotesque injustice in how they handled my filings.  I post them here so that you can judge for yourself.  
                                </p> 

                            <p>
                            It seems to me that the Australian Constition explicitly mentions New Zealand as a State of the Federation of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  
                            It is interpreted by most people to be an invitation for NZ to join at some future point rather than a declaration that it is part of the Federation (even though it has not consented to be part of the Federation).

                            <p>People say, people say, people say...  People say 'you think you can do anything you want!' like I am an entitlted litle sh*t and they get to teach me a lesson in reality (that they have the power to prevent and prohibit me from having or achieving things I've worked for).  I did think that my supervisors and teachers were paid to help me.  I trusted the quality of their information etc.  I didn't think that Martin Davies thought I was foolish (entitled, or whatever) for not...  For not asking him about staying on at the ANU and working seamlessly from Summer Scholarship into PhD.  I did find out that a couple of summer scholars were staying on, near the end of the summer.  They said that when they applied for the summer scholarship they were invited to apply for PhD around there.  I think one said that he applied later, over the summer.  Anyway, Martin did not mention to me that I could have applied to the ANU.  He also didn't say anything to me about maybe racing through the PhD and getting on payroll ASAP.  That that would likely open up more options to me (including saving actual money to invest in education maybe a bit later).  People say it's competitive.  But then I don't know what sense to make of something like Medicine.  I mean...  So...  Medical Doctors aren't trying to help their patients any more than Educators are trying to help their students.  Hmm.  Really?  Is life different...  Someplace else, in the world...

I think he lost his title as Reverend, along with Reverend Ormond Burton.  For being a pacifist.  He was imprisoned, for a time.  He lost the Ministry.  Methodism isn't really a thing, in NZ, so much, any more.  I don't think the New Zealand Government like the idea of every child having a book and having the...  Ability to read the book for themself and make up their own mind and have their very own personal relationship with something higher.  I think the New Zealand Government likes to think that God flows through them.  <a href="https://www.geni.com/discussions/143599">Pigs will eat anything.</a>  The difference between being a developed and a developing nation is in how you value your people.  Each person is precious and special and unique.  And it's an absolute horrible horrific thing when a life is cut short.  And it's a very sad thing indeed, when people come to the end of their time.  I don't want to be doctor in a world where there are too many people.  You can tell when there are too many people.  It is when it is soooooo competitive that the people are cannibalising each other.  That's a sign that we aren't properly valuing and respecting human life and human potential.  Women nearly almost sort of have access to birth control.  And men, almost sort of have access to a veto control, also, such that they can voluntariliy steralise themselves.  The problem isn't that there aren't enough people.  The problem is that we refuse to properly look after the people we have got.
