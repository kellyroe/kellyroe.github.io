                        <div class="container">

                            <p>https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bwmca-mJa20/UHqWflBnQxI/AAAAAAAAEuQ/bJcRJB7zIQ0/s640/radial+menu.jpg  radial menu's for controllers -- yes!  Temple of elemental evil implemented radial menus, even though it was keyboard and mouse game.  But they could work really well for controller.  Looking forward to Bauldur's Gate III yay...  I wish we were allowed to choose between playing with a controller and playing with a keyboard and mouse.  Why can't we use keyboard and mouse with a PS5?  We can use a mouse and keyboard or controller on PC or steamdeck ffs...  It seems like an unnecessary arbitrary and stupid restriction.  Is this the price we pay for developers to be forced to optimise games so that controller GUIs become soooo good that even the old PC die-hards start to use controllers for RPG walks since they didn't make short-cuts for walk-speed?? </p>

                            <p>I mean, f*cking hell, NZ.  I was told my reading age was 16 when I was 7 -- because that was as high as the reading tests went.  PTA tests, or whatever.  I remember being allowed into the resources room where I could study these cards...  Reading comprehen cards.  Little vignettes about Marie Curie, or whatever.  Then there were multiple choice tests of reading comprehension.  And I always getting over 90 per cent on those.  What maths instruction did I get?  Not so much...  I remember seeing maths and phsyics etc questions in the PTA tests and just trying to figure or work the problems out myself...  General intelligence problems, I guess I thought they were.  Since I never received any formal instruction on them in primary school.  </p>

                            <p>But now they want to say I don't even have teh abilty to read and write!  I can't parse a statute written in law for the general educated reader!  I can't understand university regulations!  I can't possibly write a 120 point thesis in 1 year!  Garbage garbage garbage garbage garbage land of garbage.  Full of sh*t.  Don't worry about her.  Everyone else will catch up and then we'll pay roll them and they can take and take and take and take from her.  We'll appoint them as managers or supervisors or advisors or whatever and they can just take and take and take and take and take.  Turn 65?  Having taken for 45++ years alreay?  Declare her 'too old' her life is over...  Just keep on taking just keep on taking.  Just take and take and take and take and take.  There isn't anything left to take.  Garbage wasteland of crap.  The world that you made.</p>

                            <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/493464/researcher-urges-caution-over-use-of-online-platforms-i-have-a-lot-of-concerns-about-it   </p>

                            <p>Concerns I have about it.  There was some NZ website that was trying to re-invent the wheel -- and doing it only badly.  I do feel a bit bad about saying that, but I think it was dismantled / funding ceased for it.  I mean to say, they were trying to do a NZ version of Khan Academy.  And it was just a not very good version of it, basically, and I think they were not keeping the kids data secure etc, in addition to other problems.</p>

                            <p>Sal Khan (an MIT graduate) started Khan Academy.  And as things developed he obtained MIT computer engineering / technology / infrastructure that makes the site possible.  Right?  And he knows his maths stuff..  And quite a lot of other stuff, too...  Maybe a little sketchier on some of the Arts / Social Science stuff..  But still knows really rather a lot...  I mean, he really understands the math.  He's a wonderful teacher.  Don't get me wrong, the videos do vary a lot in quality.  They do.  But there are an awful lot of them, also.  And you just don't know when someone will explain something in a way that helps things go 'click' or 'clunk' for you.  The site is great for math.</p>

                            <p>The thing about math, too, is that it is culumlative.  And you need to practice it regularly to keep the skill up.  Partly it does involve you doing rote things over and over and over.  With a high degree of accuracy.  You develop your working memory workbench ability to hold numbers in memory and pull them in and manipulate them.  But it builds culumulatively.  </p>

                            <p>The main difficulty or problem with math instruction is that the instruction isn't at the right level for the learner.  I mean to say, it becomes very very painful and monotonous and boring and it is impossible to pay attention when you are ready to move on -- and things aren't moving on.  But it is also very very painful and monotonous and boring and it is impossible to pay attention when you have no idea what they are talking about because you are missing some prior thing.  So...  The great thing about Khan Academy is that every single individual learner can work at just the right level for where they are at today.  And the whole idea of 'grade appropriate' just falls out.  It doesn't matter.  It is irrelevant.  You can just work to where you are.  And the site has gotten a lot better with respect to you doing a little test so that you don't even need to choose what course or grade level to be picking out contents for -- you can just do a little test and when you get something wrong becuase you don't know how to do that the site will actually direct you to the relevant content for you.  Given where you are at.  Today.  </p>

                            <p>It is really really really important not to under-estimate the amount of money and labor and work that has gone into developing Khan Academy website to the standard it is today.  Millions if not billions.  Seriously.  NZ can't possibly make a NZ version of as high a quality any time in the next...  It is an insane waste of resources even to try.  What NZ could do is develop a unit or two to contribute.  THey do have 'bleeding edge' curriculum contents.  They are developing units on climate change for example.  Planets.  Stuff like that.  We could develop units on NZ history.  Pacifica History . NZ Maaori history.  Whatever.  We could be contributing to the curriculum contents so that some kid in South America could learn about the Treaty of Waitangi, in NZ.  Some kid in Boston.  And so that Maaori kids in NZ can learn about whatever in South America as well.  Exchange of information. Exchange of knowledge.  Everybody contributing and  learning from each other...  Etc...  Again.  MIT computer science engineering infrastructure...  How ever many millions or billions of dollars of investment already.  Come on, people, try and get with the programme....</p>

                            <p>The second point I have to make...  Is that videos are great for certain kinds of curriculum contents, in partiuclar.   Maths.  When you need to learn how to lay out calculations and show your working etc.  Diagrams.  Stuff like that.  Videos are great because you can rewind and hear it again and so on.  Follow the sequence.  But you know what else is great for your ability to go to the precise place that you need in order to pull out that bit of information.  Books.  It is faster to find the place where the information is in a book than a youtube or whatever video.  I mean, imagine if you had a talking book of the Bible.  Or Big Robbins, or something.  Trying to find the precise or exact part of it...  There is controversy over electronic vs print books...  Tactile feedback of you remembering the information being about 4 mm through on the right side of the page about 3/4 down under a picture of...  You will know it when you see it...  You can thumb through...  Flick to it...  It upset me no end that University of Auckland curriculum contents for first year scienc subjects (for example) were very very focused on lecture contents (from powerpoint presentation) where the powerpoint notes often weren't made available else they were too bullet point only to study from...  SO you were being tested on lecture contents...  So you needed to transcribe the lecture contents to write down every word so that you had written material  you could study from.  It was an awful waste of time.  Trying to study from watching 1 hour long lectures.  Trying to write down the infromation into a format that was faster to study from...  Was the idea to test studnets on the infroamtion contents develivered in lecture format?  Or were the kids in certain halls given better quality (e.g., textbook or written) informational contents?  HIGH QUALITY TEXTBOOKS PEOPLE.</p>

                            <p>Are there maths  books?  Are there?  I have NZQA maths books...  I was using them alongside Khan Academy content and that was useful.  I found that Sal Khan was better at explaining.  But that's because for me I need to learn to read the notation.  For example, the multiplication sign is often implicit.  Sal is great at reading the equations and explaining them.  He is also great at minimising use of a calculator and explaining how he does the calculations...  </p>

                            <p>I love it when he puts up a problem and I can stop or pause the video and try and solve it myself.  SOmeone else doesn't blurt out the answer  before I've had the chance to do it.  I can take time to take a breath before I start 'I can do this' then approach it calmly and sqeuentially.  Methodically.  It's ingrained.  Starting to be.  Motor memory, even.  AUtomatic.  Doesn't take cognitive resources anymore.  Freeing up cognitive resources for other bits that will start to become more important later on...  Then I think I've done it.  But maybe that particular thing there wasn't quite optimal, but I"m not sure how to handle it different.  Then Sal starts working through the problem.  I wonder if this way and that way could get me to an equivlanet place.  He says that yes, it does.  Yay!  I feel like I'm getting the hang of it.  He uses different words or terms to explain things in different ways.  You start to learn equivalences.  They are synononums they mean the same.  You build up the vocabulary.  But this is all because the pacing is right.  Because you choose the pacing.  Pause.  Need a bio break.  Rewind...  I missed that word because I was wondering about that other thing.  Because you have control of the pacing of the content delivery and you can go over it until you feel that you've got it.  I don't know how people can learn maths in a classroom environment.  I think that if I already knew how to do it I'd have fun flexing in a classroom environment.  But that's what a classroom environment is.  A flex.  For people who already have the knowledge.  </p>

                            <p>It can be fun hearing stuff you already know.  Favorite bedtime story.  Doing routine calculations becomes tedious, however.  THen when the teacher jumps on a single mistake (like a typo) as a reason to hold you back for moooooooooore money!!!!!!!</p>

                            <p>I am sure that some maths teachers in NZ schools are really really good teachers with great understanding of maths concepts etc.  But I'm pretty sure that most would say they are not as proficient in maths or teaching or explaining concepts as Sal Khan.  It is a credit to most teachers that they can see this and they don't try and do their kids a disservice by withholding resources from them.  I don't know what to say about a situation, say, when maths instruction becomes, in NZ schools, what '20 minutes of silent reading' used to be.  Where each individual works on Khan Academy Curriculum contents at whatever level is right for them today...  5 days a week.  What that would do to NZ's maths literacy...  It would do phenomenal things.</p>

                            <p>You know...  If I had have been put in front of a computer and given Khan Academy when I was in school...  Maybe when I was doing detention or something...  If I had the OPPORTUNITY to have worked through that instead of being present in a noisy classroom with teachers when I felt a bit of anxiety / intimidation in getting right answers quickly...  I think I would have really loved math and it would have been my favorite subject.  But I already knew how to read so 'don't worry about her -- she'll be alright'.</p>

                            <p>___</p>

                            <p>Problem.  If politicians realise the power of Khan academy then it will quickly become undermined.  Infiltrated with junk and the kids will be forced to spend time on junk curriculum.  Because that's the real aim or purpose or goal or what it is that we are trying to do here, let's be honest, right?</p>

                            <p>There is some kind of tension or problem or whatever..  Things grow too big.  Whatever.  As the site gets bigger it becomes more bleeding edge.  Quality becomes more variable etc.  On the other hand.. Younger people are helpling develop curriculum contents, too.  Hey, Sal is trying to train a new generation of teachers.  Right?  </p>

                            <p>Regarding the in-person teaching thing it really depends on the quality.  You need to hear that many studnets say that they are being bullied and abused by 'teachers' in their schools.  People who are in the schools on payroll or maybe just paying the 'university' while they are in postings in the schools while they use their positions in the schools to bully and abuse the students.  When this is the case for students...  Well...  I think it says rather a lot when they would prefer not to go to school.  Else they only go to school to try and have peer friendships.  Particularly when their parents may not be much of any better...</p>

                            <p>__________</p>

                            <p>So, what to do...  Well...  Get Quigley to tell everybody how many 120 point Masters theses the University of Waikato has outputted in 2023.  2022.  2021.  2020.  2019.  2018.  How many 120 point Masters theses were awarded in each of those years, and the enrolment dates associated with each of those theses.  I want to see the actual titles of the thesis.  Them being lodged in the library.  Now, the same, again for 360 point PhD theses.  I'm asking for the research output of the graduate research studnets at the Univesrity of Waikato.  So that we can understand the nature of the competition.  It isn't between peers.  I mean to say, the studnets aren't cutting each other off at the knees, the nature of the competition is differnet from that. WHen the supervisors think their job is to eat their young.</p>

                            <p>Now, given how the University of Waikato treats their graduate research studnets (they were effectively recently given a pay-rise, even, moooooore money for the university of waikato for every graduate research student they claim to have recorded as being enrolled...  They want a medical school.  A graduate entry one.  So they can fill out the hospital and medical clinics with the bodies that they have recorded as having enrolled.  SO they can collect more and more and more and more money from the studnets and the government both for having them.  So they can place them in the hospitals and medical clinics and tell them to 'get in there and have a go' and do all the scut work (I define this in a minute).  Now that Justice Toogood (pulled out of retirement -- not appointed via proper process) has stated as the output of the high court that there wasn't anything wrong with the University of waikato recording me as being enrolled ot study an MPhil with them in 2019 when I NEVER APPLIED TO BE ENROLLED IN THAT COURSE OR PROGRAMME OF STUDY and for them to get more money from the government for having recorded that.  For the IRD to now be telling me that I owe the University of Waikato course fees for enrolment in 2019 WHEN I NEVER APPLIED TO BE ENROLLED IN THAT COURSE OR PROGRAMME OF STUDY.  When they refused to schedule an oral defence in 2019 when they had a report from an external examiner requesting an oral defence...  They are not running a university, hey.  Scummy scam.  There isn't anything there.  </p>

                            <p>So, I really wouldn't be surprised at all if they don't get their Medical School.  Then what will happen is we will ship to the Waikato however many teenagers and they'll  be put to work and not paid for it...  Since NZ basically is doing the whole descent into madness thing.  As a country.  Not developing at all.  There isn't anything here.</p>

                            <p>What would they do if they actually wanted to do it properly?  They would have to actually pay people to teach.  What would they teach?  Well, curriculum contents have been pretty well developed via Khan Academy and USMLE study contents etc.  The contents have been pretty well developed.  Examinations have been written, even.  It isn't that hard.  But they don't want to do it properly.  Is the best explanation insofar as I can see.  They are investedin corruption and exploitation.  They won't do it properly.  I can say 'here you go, here are the curriculum contents' so you can learn them..  But will you?  Wouldn't it be helpful for people to help walk you through them?  Try and explain them to you?  The coordination of it...  Hey, why am I even trying to explain to the f*cking dumb and dumber show.  (1)  Enrol in teh qualification.  (2)  Graduate from the qualification.  (3)  Contribute to the developmetn of the qualification so that other studnets can have a higher quality qualification.  But they can't even / wont' even process an application to enrol.  THey certainly won't process a graduation.  I mean to say, there really isnt' anything there.</p>

                            <p>https://www.amazon.com/First-USMLE-Step-Thirty-Second/dp/1264285264  Here we go people.  Just saying.  Democratisation of knowledge.  That is what that looks like.  https://www.pathoma.com/  You, too, can study Medical Student Curriculum and become empowered with the actual knowledge.  So you don't need to listen to the flow decisions of, um, uh, ur...  Um...  Uh.. Yeah...  Also, have you seen the Khan Academy website?  Curriculum contents.  From kindegarten maths up to AP (aka the highest possible secondary level) calculus?  They have chemistry and physics...  They have american history.  It is interesting to me that they teach history through the lens of law, quite a lot.  The presidents at the time, the laws that were passed.  The cases that resulted in the laws  being changed etc.  So they come through the curriculum with a body of knowledge.  THey have world history.  They are developing curriculum contents all the time.  Units on climate change and so on.  More 'bleeding edge' (newer) curriculum contents.  They were pretty much maths and science focus originally.  Now they are much broader with arts and developing into language a bit.  Bleeding edge science.  Less medicine focused these days, more engineering.  So that people don't have this idea that medicine is the top of a knowledge hierarchy, or something.  YOu can even do economics.  Basic stuff on finance.  The curriculum contents are pretty terrific.  It makes me care less about what NZ is doing or trying to do.  The fact that the kids got internet because of Covid.  The Medical books didn't hardly change at all because of Covid.  But the kids got internet and they can access Khan Academy, now.  If they want to learn about all kinds of things...  While the chumps in NZ are too busy bickering and b*tching and moaning and complaining and fighting and trying to cut everybody else's kids (and maybe even their own) off at the knees.  You can just avoid the whole thing and work through Khan Academy Curriculum contents.  There is so much out there...  THe school thing is just political.  And mostly it seems to  be about trafficking teenagers (particularly) for their labor (while they pay the 'university') and it's just a scummy scummy scam of a situation, really.  </p>

                            <p>In the US people would talk about the interviews they had for match positions.  I guess they are like our 'registrar training' positions that we offer in Australasia.  People would say that something to think about was how much the training position would or would not involve 'scut work'.  My understanding was that 'scut work' is basically when they put you to work -- and they aren't actually training you.  They just tell you to get in there and fake it.  Else they teach you a little something something (maybe how to change a wound dressing and look for signs of sepsis) and then put you to work simply doing that one repetitive task over and over and over and they don't teach you anything else.  The idea was that the scutwork placements didn't have any intention of signing off on completion of your training.  They were getting you doing a job for them for low to no wages.  Keeping you an under-skilled ford assembly line sort or kind of a worker, really.  Does Australasia have an education and training system -- or is it just scut-work?  When you get to graduate level study (after a 4 year undergrad qualification, say a 3 year community college level qualification and then 1 year of honors) what more is there to your 'education'?  We don't have doctoral level course-work.  Masters level course-work is one and the same as honors level course-work -- isn't it?  You don't do Honors in a particular subject and then a 2 year masters in that same subject with another year of course-work first -- do you?  No.  You don't.  It's just a scut-work system.  Get the students outputting research (indistinguishable in quality from the paid academics) as third or even fourth year studnets.  No more course-work.  Put them to work -- while they pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the 'university'.  What education and training system?  Scummy scam.</p>

                            <p>So who do the jobs go to, then?  Well, I guess the jobs go to the people who think that this is okay.  The ones prepared to tuck in behind the people on payroll for however many years.  Waiting for them to die, I suppose.  The ones who get a kick out of bullying and abusing their students into giving them more and more and more and more work and money both.  Waiting for them to die, in turn, so they can take their place.  Ugh.  Who would voluntarily choose to be part of such a thing?  Oh, I'm sorry -- did you think you got to choose?</p>

                            <p>What education and training system?  WHere does all the money go?  I asked the ADHB for row information.  Name.  Registration number.  Qualification (e.g., MBChB.  Position title (e.g., registrar or consultant).  FTE (e.g., if it is 1/3 of a position (clinical, teaching, research).  The pay that goes to that person, therefore.  E.g., 1/3 a full time salary for a 1/3rd position.  THey refused to supply the information.  I strongly suspect that people are being paid who never set foot in the hospital (they are off playing golf) and people are paid for clinical work when they don't have qualifications.  Most of the money actually goes to senior administration and most of the clinical positions are intentionally kept unfilled.  Then students flesh out the hospital.  People who are paying the 'university'.  People who are paid very very little indeed (who pay the 'university' more than they are paid often enough).  Then we simply churn through them.  Their visas expire and they are deported.  Replaced by new students.  It's quite the scummy scam.</p>

                            <p>What education and training system?  What skilled workforce?  There doesn't seem to be anything here...  Anything you do learn is in spite of and despite them.  You can learn quite a lot because of democratisation of knowledge.  But you know what NZ is like.  Nation of bullies and abusers.  The government thinks that knowledge is power and wants to keep the people stupid.  Wants a population who can't read write or do arithmetic so the stupids in command can feel competent.  Race to the bottom.  Then we can just redefine 'reading' as 'shutting up and listening' to the leaders prime time broadcasts and say that we have the highest literacy in the world!  In stupid-land.  Yeah, right.</p>

                            <p>I don't know how people in the US felt about seeing Jacinda Ardern get an honorary degree...  When she was meeting with Biden was he saying to her that it was pretty funny, hey, since she probably couldn't even name all the US presidents, but here she was...  It was an honorary degree, rather than an actual degree, of course.  I mean, she never did her honors (fourth) year at Waikato.  Did she?  She doesn't have the equivalent of a US college (4 year) degree.  And she was appointed leader of a nation...  Shows how little NZ values education.  That prime ministers, with all the power they have (e.g., to declare unlawful lockdowns) don't even have 4 years of tertiary study under their belt.  Not even 4 years of tertiary training.  Still, when the judges won't uphold the law...  Well...  How many years do you study the law before being pronounced graduated (depending on who your daddy was, of course), in NZ?  What doctors?  What lawyers?  What engineers?  There's nothing here...  The worst of it is how resolute the leaders are regarding how there never will be...  NOt on their watch. </p>

                            <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/493231/government-questions-cost-value-of-national-s-medical-school-policy  Warwick Bagg WILL NOT CALCULATE A GPA.  Is it intellectual handicapp or something else?  The Jury is still out on that...  How old is Warwick, by the way?  He's oldler then 65 -- right?  He retired, in fact, then was  brought back in when his studnets turned out not to be as psychopathically inclined as himself.  He's got nothing to lose -- right???  Time to go Warwick, you f*cking psychopath.  Can't even calculate a GPA FFS...  Des Gorman!!! Oh my!!! He's the 'thank you for smoking' guy who works for the ACC. His rant goes like this 'there is no evidence that could attest to your condition having been caused or exacerbated by your occupational environment'.  Wow.  Working the coal mines doesn't make you more likely to have cancer.  Smoking cigaretted doesn't amke you more likely to have cancer.  Working the asbestos removal...  He's a f*cking psychopath.  None so f*cking stupid as the stupid f*cks on payroll.  Go on Auckland keep sending your students to training places in the Waikato...  So they can take all of the accreditations away...  All of the accreditations away...  F*cking psychopaths.  Like possums that stip every tree before moving on to the next one.  F*cking psychopaths...  Why should Waikato University have to prove t his and that and the other with the training?  Auckland offers NONE of that.  Tell you what..  Get the supervisors to f*cking die already.  Get out the f*cking way and allow the next generation to do things properly hey.  You f*cking well wouldn't.  Well, time to go, get out the f*cking way.  How old is Des, hey?  Time to go, Des..  Where are all the studnets that you trained?  YOu f*cking psychopath.  TIme to go, Des!!! off you go..  Hurrah!!!! No more Des!!! F*cking psychopath!!!! Couldn't even calculate a GPA 'there can be no causation without correlation and we can't proooooooooooooove causation!!!' time to go Des!  Thank you for smoking . Guess the cigarttes killed him, hey, what do you know.  Bit of bad luck that hey.</p>

                            <p>How is the Serbian born British Trained did a bunch of work in Neurosurgery for Waikato for years and years and years...  But they refused to employ him as a neurosurgeon in Dunedin, preferring to leave the position unfilled..  He was going to go back to England and sue New Zealand for not properly processing his application for employment in Dunedin, or similar...  How is that going?  Him suing them, I mean to say?  Has he decided just to cut his looses?  Write New Zealand off as a nasty little despot and you are lucky that you managed to get out alive?  That kind of a sort of a thing?  We are still trying to recruit people to get in there!  Have a go!  Off you go!  (Pay you later)...  Fake it till you have it.  Pay you never.  F*cking psychopaths.  Why don't YOU practice Medicine, Ayesha?  Or are you the one they picked out to go blackbird for nurses from Malaysia.  We can send them out to home visits by themselves and people can say that they are required to rub ointment on their penis because they don't want to do it, themself.  That's what their last intern did.  If they don't want to do it then they'll report them and they can be deported without their qualification.  HOw many complaints do you recieve from students every year, Chris Whelan?  How many complaints?  How many of them do you acknowledge as 'formally having been received by you'??  How much do they pay you to do that,  hey?</p>

                            <p>Now, we just need to stop for another minute and check in with the Judiciary that they understand the scope of what they are doing with the inquiry into abuse in state care.  Firstly, the scope of the inquiry was to be limited to STATE CARE.  Why?  Because this is the start of the inquiry.  This is the first step.  And we are STARTING with the STATE.  We are STARTING with the responsibility borne by the GOVERNMENT.  There will be later stages or steps of inquiry into the private sector (schools and churches) -- but that is for ANOTHER DAY.  FOCUS.  STATE CARE.  Surely they aren't this stupid?  Secondly, there was a date range.  Correct?  I don't remember what it was off the top of my head, but the scope of this present current inquiry (that has been delayed yet again) was to be restricted to HISTORIC abuses by the STATE.  HISTORIC.   Between certain years.  Later investigations will look into PRESENT abuses.  Maybe ones older.  Maybe ones newer.  Maybe current.  Why?  Because the point of the f*cking inquiry, is to hurry the f*cking up, already.  Every other nation has done one, already.  There is nothing new in this.  It is just NZ dragging it's f*cking heels, however many f*cking years behind.  HURRY UP, NEW ZEALAND.  HURRY UP.  HURRY UP.  It just will not do it.  The judiciary seems incapable of focusing on the scope of inquiry that was set by the UN.  They keep changing it to make it too big and unweildy so they can cry cry cry about it being too hard.  It's too hard all the abuses in the private sector.  It's too hard all the present abuses in the public sector.  It's all too hard.  What was the scope of the inquiry supposed to be?  And when was the outcome of that supposed to be delivered then?  And now it is being delayed, because it is an election year, I suppose.  Only our elected leader has been taken into US Custody and to the best of our knowledge the non-elected second in command has  been taken into Chinese Custody and is being forwarded to Europe.  There isn't anything here, hey.</p>

                            <p>Off to Europe now, Chris!!! Oh my, quite the Jet setter.  Where is Jacinda Ardern (our supposedly elected prime minister).  She announced to the graduates of Harvard that nobody would be prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus in NZ (weren't when it was a crime in the crimes act, and it isn't a crime in the crimes act anymore, apparently) and then she's off in the name of her mental health to be paid a million dollars, or something, to write a book on 'leadership' paid by Harvard.  What happened to her elected duties to NZ?  Now Chris is up and he's off to China and now he's off to Europe...  Take Chris Whelan with you.  He who refuses to acknowledge any complaints about NZ Universities in the name of upholding their quality and integrity.  F*cking psychopaths.  F*cking psychopaths.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                            <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/493126/cataract-surgery-eye-surgeons-worry-about-meeting-demand-as-more-qualify  Oh noes!!! Do you think the..  What is he?  70?  You think the 70 year old 'surgeon' who likely killed his DHB wife will come back from Sydney and help???  WHere are all the students he trained????  </p>

                            
                            <p>Ask the people on your payroll.</p>

                            <p>Note that the USA and China are not doing business in this judisdiction, anymore.  New Zealand is closed, for business.  Our politicians and business leaders are required to travel overseas to sign contracts in foreign jurisdictions.  Better start training up  your legal defense to be heard in foreign jurisdictions, then.  Since you will be accountable to them and their military, one can only suppose.  How are you going to find people acknowledged as lawyers by foreign courts who will choose to represent you?  But how can  you win, otherwise?  No more pulling judges out of retirement to claim to receive evidence that was never supplied and to refuse to accept evidence that was supplied.  But you'll never be extradited to stand trial, you think?  Turn this whole state of Australia into New Manus Island detention camp prison facility.  Do you think that China would do you the courtesy of translating your trial into English?  Why would they offer you translation services?  Why would they extend to you any courtesy that you refuse to extend to others?  Makes no f*cking sense, at all. </p>

                            <p> Don't worry, Ayesha is trying to motivate and inspire a  new lot of people to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the 'Universities' for the honor of getting to kill patients in the vague hope that if they start killing patients nobody will talk to them.  What do you have to do to get them to shut up their face-holes?  It is like the people responsible for all the delays in the abuse in state care inquiry are paid by the amount of time that they take, or something.  Alllllll the extensions for them, therefore.  The compulsory extensions for them.  More and more and more time to make things worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.  Why don't  you practice Medicine, Ayesha?  They gave you a training place and they say that you graduated.  Why don't you do your job, then?  When did Ashley Bloomfield last see a patient?  What happened last time he killed a patient, then?  It's soooooooooo competitive.  It's soooooooo competitive!!!  It's soooooo competitive not everybody gets to do it, nobody gets to do it, there's nothing there.  It's sooooooooooooo competitive!!!!!</p>

                            <p>I don't know how Amy and Sah do it!  They are supermen amongst people!  Able to work as an emergency room physician and able to work practically another full time job as a Les Mills Group Fitness Instructor Model leading high intensity training classes like Spin Cycling.  Able to be enrolled as a Medical Student while attending workplace internships while being able to work practically another full time job as a Les Mills Group Fitness Instructor Model leading group fitness classes.  I don't know how they do it!  Where they find these supermen!  Maybe want to give Amy a few more ER shifts if she's got that much energy to burn at the end of her ER day because that is not what other ER employees are saying about the reality of life as an ER physician.  She stealing the good stuff or...  What is the most likely explanation,  here?  </p>

                            <p>So...  All those people who enrol in Sport and Exercise Science qualifications...  They don't get to work as Group Fitness Instructor Models because that would consitute skilled labor, one can only suppose, and if there is one thing that we know about New Zealand it is that nobody will actually be paid to do skilled labor.  We will get the Chemistry PhD's and put them to work as marketers and...</p>

                            <p>What 'Education and Training System'?  It's soooooooo competitive there simply isn't anything there!</p>

                            <p>We really don't need to reinvent the wheel on 'best practice' and cry cry cry cry cry about  how it is alll toooooo haaaaaard.  Best practices have been developed already.  E.g., The surgical safety checklist that was origionally developed for aviation security regarding who is in the flight deck, their credentials, and the specific role they are playing in the operations today.  The check-list of what safety checks have been done.  Etc.  Our problem is that we REFUSE to follow best practice.  Consistently choosing people too stupid or pigheaded or both to do what it is that they are supposed to do.  Those who grubby grubbed their way into positions (just get in there and take it fake it until you have it and then it's yours and nobody will be able to get rid of you) say that there is no alternative to them.  No alterative to Dawkins f*cking seflish genes and the hostile competitive uncooperative prison camp detention facility that is the State of New Zealand.  So says the only one's you'd payroll.  What's that University of Auckland?  Better write another ethics paper on how targeting the children to be victims of the state is morally compulsory!  Only way to be made Professor in the garbage dump of a wasteland.  Best be writing papers for the NZ Medical Students Journal, then, Sah's a little busy reading the script for whatever relase of Balance...  Oh...  No, she's not.  She's making up her own flows now?  She's a natural!</p>

                            <p>Then what is supposed to happen?  You get given to a 65+++ GP as their 'apprentice' -- only they will never sign off on completion of training.  They will never write you a reference.  It's soooooo compeititive and there will be a job for you only over their dead body.  Did Kim Sterelny die, yet?  Oh please God, I hope so.  Then maybe someone else can get some research funding, for a change.  How many decades did the Australian National University keep Carl Brusse enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled in the doctoral programme?  Refusing to get his work out to externals so  he could be credited as having completed a thesis on personal identity, I think it was, in the first instance.  Refusing to pay him post-doctoral fellowship wages for working, then, under Sterelny.  So that Sterelny could get paid hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year...  Was he even the author of half of what was claimed to be his?  He was a journal editor, right?  So he took work from some and reattributed authorship of it to others.  So that he could be the only game in town.  The psychopaths have taken over, he would say. What training and apprenticeship system?  Is he f*cking well dead, yet?  F*cking hurry up and die you selfish f*cking prick.  Your payroll wasn't even enough for you, you greedy bastard.  Your wife's payroll, too.  What is your daughter doing, these days?  I'm sure she grew up to be a real winner, what with you setting an example of how you just get out there and take and take and take and take and take.  You big phoney fake.  You couldn't talk about your earlier work because you weren't even the author of it.  You big phoney fraud.  What's that?  You f*cked the dog you f*cking c*nt and other eloquent expressions..  So eloquent you were (yeah, right).  What education system?  *There's nothing there*.</p>

                            <p>And then he gets sick, and Amy gets to have 5 minutes of silence.  Good job!!!</p>

                            <p>Maybe send the un-elected Ayesha along with Chris Whelan to Malaysia on the next blackbirding expedition for students to enrol in nursing qualifications.  Visas tied to Calendar Girls etc.  Take Chris along with you so he can explain all the work that he does to uphold the quality and integrity of NZ University qualifications by throwing away all the complaints he receives about NZ Universities refusing to say they have  been formally lodged.</p>
                       
                       <p>Hi Souxie, NZ's 'personality' Dr (without  the Medical Degree) Born in South Africa trained in England New Zealander of the year...  Do your studnets (who work in your microbiology laboratory) have face masks, yet?  Just wondering on the infectious disease protocols that are followed by your studnets working in your labs...</p>

                       <p>Hey Souxie, congrats on your publication.  HOw much did you have to pay to get that?  I'm wondering because you previously said that you had to pay $20,000 or more to have your work considered by peer reviewers.  So I'm wondering how much money you paid or the University of Auckland paid to have your publication subjected to peer review.  Know what I find interesting?  Reading about how medical studnets aren't getting consent forms to do 'cervical examinations' where the cervical examinations sometimes involve pushing the scope or whatever device all the way up so that they can actually see the ovary!!  Oh  my!!! Hey, Souxie, what do you think the chances are, of collecting cells from the uterus and pushing them up the fallopian tubes?  WHat do you think the changes are of pushing the edometrial cells from the uterus, maybe through a hole in the wall of the fallopian tube (oops!) and so on?  What do you think the chances may be of that kind of sort of a thing.. As an actual *CAUSE* of endometriosis?  Oh my..  We would need to do a randomised double blind control trial of people who had had non or un consenting cervical exams (maybe under anasthetic for an unrelated condition) and those who didn't have..  Who wants to be in the non-control group?  OH, hey you don't get to choose!!!  F*cking psychopaths.  Hey...  Pay me later.  No worries..  You can just pay me later.</p>

                       <p>The current Vice Chancellor of the University of Auckland chose to spend tens of thousands of dollars to hire a major law firm to defend the University's right to give Medical places to people who were not ranked high enough for Medical places (according to the criterion they published for the purposes of their accountabilty).  The issue was brought to her attention (as it was brought to Stuart McCutcheons) and her response was to hire legal representation for the 'University'.  They are not properly processing applications to Medicine (also likely to other programmes).  This isn't because they hire some incompetent to do selection for $60,000 a year, or similar, it is becuase the decisions are altered at the *highest* level.  THey refuse to enter my correctly calculated GPA into their selection algorithm and state my rank order score for 2019 entry and again for 2020 entry.  They will not do it.  The Education and Training Act is clear that I (as a domestic adult) am entitled to be enrolled in the programme I applied to.  They refuse to say what my rank order score was.  THey firstly said it was 'too low' and when I asked them how that could be they informed me how they miscalculated my GPA.  I supplied a calculation of it that was within their rules and they refused to accept it.  Simply refused.  Why?  So they can keep having their fun doing unauthorised cervical examiantions on non-consenting patients and the like, one can only suppose.  F*cking psychopaths.  Not even trying to have a health system, hey.  There isn't anything there.  Not even trying.  Tens of thousands of dollars to lawyers.  New Zealand *not safe to travel.  not the developed world.  cannot do business in this jurisdication.  not even trying to be fair.  What evidence of being fair do you see?  There is nothing there.  What evidence of Canberra being fair do you see?  There is nothing there.  It wasn't all very very very very personal about me -- look at how they treated Carl Brusse.  More than a decade of re re re enrollment because Kim Sterelny is a f*cking psychopath.  Not even trying to be fair.  Now they refuse to informally sort out and also refuse to formally acknowledge a complaint that *they didn't send anybodies thesis out for external examination -- did they?*  I never attended anybody's oral defense.  How did they decide who and when to give PhD's to?  And what reason do they even have to believe that the ones they gave them to were the author of them?  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  Not even a hint of *try*.</p>

                       <p>Aw,  hey, that's okay.  You just pay me later.  I'll just wait for Sterelny to f*cking die.  Is he f*cking dead yet, then?  What is he, 75?  How much longer,  hey.  The euthanasia drugs are arriving for the death camps in Australia soon -- right?  Not to be given to the children (they 'suicide' all voluntary-like, obviously) but to the over 65's who won't get off the f*cking payroll.  Right?  I'm talking about ones who have had more than enough payroll to have paid off the mortgage on a modest family home.  Unbridled greed.  Get in there Amy!  Get in there Sah!  Go get 'em!  This is what you've been training for!!!! Off you go!!!!  What education and training system?  It's sooooooo competitive!!!! Get in their Amy!!!!! Tttttskkk ttttssk grrrrrr get in there!!! Ugh ugh ugh!!!! Rawwwwwwwr!!!! Get in there!  Of you go!  Sic 'em!!!! Goooooo!!!!!  It's soooooo competitive!!!!  What education and training system???</p>

                       <p>And now it's an election year and likely people won't vote.  They've had it up to their f*cking eyebrows and then some, with the f*cking government.  Telling them what to do.  Unlawful lockdowns.  Ruining people's livlihoods.  Gleeful expressions on their faces as the judiciary rules that while they were technically in the wrong they can do anything anything anything they like with complete and utter immunity and it is the people who must suffer the consequences and harms of the governments crimes.  Not much in the way of jobs being advertised.  Unless you want to work for the marketing con-munications of trying to make the government look good.  Put a positive spin on all the crap that falls out of their face-holes.  The garbage garbage garbage output.  WHere does the money go??  Where's the money!!!  WHere's the money!!!  Couple hundred thousand for second to Una Jagose.  I thought Una was going to retire?  ALl the work she did reappointing retired judges to not see anything wrong.  It isn't about the election.  Just business as usual from the NZ government.  Great big con.  There's nothing there.</p>

                       <p>Apparently all the doors were open to Chris and his entourage of NZ business leaders...  Even the doors to the 14 year old's rooms, Chris, even those?  I wonder if they try and tempt the 'people' who travel claiming to be 'number one citizens'.  To collect up evidence of their crimes. What kind of people they are.  How they conduct themselves when they are doing business.  All those back-room deals, right?  The casino trips?  Little walk up k road for some entertainment?  Wink wink nudge nudge. Is it like that, is it?  That's how we do business?  How we are closed for business.  No business.  I wonder how many of the business leaders will be coming  back.  YOu have have them.  Take them.  How is it possible to do business in this jurisdiction?  What business?  There's nothing here, hey.</p>

                       <p>Everyone is just imploding on each other.  It's soooooooo competitive.  Right Sterelny?  I guess you would know.  That's why they pay you hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year salary and then hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year research funding to be the only game in town.  No room for anybody else.  All of the everything for Sterelny!!  You win, Sterelny.  THere isn't any philosophy curriculum left.  Right?  That was the goal.  Right?  Turn it into second-rate science.  Yeah?  Take the university curriculum out of the university and the secondary curriculum out of secondary school.  Have the teachers working in prison camps and you can ponce about as glorious Lord!  Have your 'students' house-sitting for you and feeding your cats.  Say they are required to go away with you on camping trips oh so important for their careers!!!  F*cking psychopath.  I did want a career as an academic.  And then I met the arse-holes from ANU and I didn't want one, anymore.  Oh ho ho ho ho we didnt' think that she wanted any money!  SHe was asking for it, therefore!!  Just handed over more and more and more and more and more of her work for no-credit.  F*cking psychopaths.  It doesn't matter what people want whether you pay them fairly or not.  F*cking psychopaths.  What education and training system?  What 'universities'.  There isn't anything there.  Get in there Amy!  Get in there Sah!  Sic em!!!!</p>

                       <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/493178/teachers-shocked-at-leaked-draft-of-science-curriculum-where-s-the-physics-and-chemistry  It is 'heavy on the Philosophy'?  Excuse me?  ...  I'm sorry --  I feel your pain.  But it is important for you to know that this is not honest Philosophy Curriculum, either.  It is literally non-sense no sense.  The complete undermining of any pretence at all of an 'educational system'.  Don't get me wrong -- I understand that the 'bleeding edge' science curriculum is doing work on refocusing or orienting or whatever the science curriculum contents into teaching the standard curriculum through thematic presentation.. However..  It is uncontroversially fair to say that NZL hasn't gotten with the programme sufficiently to contribute to the bleeding edge of..  Uh.  Well, anything.  Anything.  ANything at all.  F*cking retards...  Sooooooo f*cking slooooooooooow.  Hurrrrrrry uuuuuup NZL...  Huurrrrrrry uuuuuuuuuuuuuup... </p>

                       <p>The 'University of Auckland' has a CUP programme -- Certificate of University Preparation.  Where they promise to teach all the years of secondary school curriculum to people enrolled in the CUP programme at the University.  They are too busy exercising their discretion to enrol people who aren't 20 who don't have the academic credentials to be enrolled in University Programmes in the Univesrity (moooooooore mooooneey!!!) that they don't have any time or energy left to process the applications to enrol from the 20 year + studnets who are *eilgible by statute*.  F*cking retards.  Can't do / won't do the only thing they are supposed to do.  OMG..  It's like they have been all motivated and inspired by the royal commission of inquiry on how to refuse to do any of the most basic things that the UN has directed...  Can't do.  Won't do.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                       <p>Step one:  Get with the program.  Step Two:  Do the program.  Step Three:  Transcend the programme..  Develop new program...  Oooooooh...  GET WITH THE PROGRAM NZL. HURRY UP!!! HURRY UP!!!! HURRY UP!!! WE'LL ALL HAVE BEEN EXTERMINATED BEFORE OUR ESTEEMED LEADERS ON PAYROLL DIE.  HURRY UP!!! HURRY UP!!!! HURRRY UP!!!!</p>

                       <p>The 'extension programmes' or 'extension curriculum's' on things like energy cycling and climate change...  Should be reward (funded) projects for high performers in standard curriculum contents. NZ has no right to even try and be cutting or bleeding edge when it just resolutely and determinedly fails to get with the f*cking programme, every step of the f*cking way...</p>

                       <p>You know, if only I could be a third class American.  Or a second class Australian.  My life would be so much better than it is now, in NZL.  Because it's such a f*cking dump of a waste-land so Australian and THe USA can troll for second and third class people to treat poorly..  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                       <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/300921109/the-careers-that-will-survive-the-ai-revolution--and-pay-the-highest-salary  Really...  Well, between surgery simulator (just get in there and have a go, anybody, anybody, anybody at all) and 'I'm sorry there isn't anything that I can do' and Chat GTP output (indistinguishable to most 'doctors')...  I mean, who can tell the difference between a Yoga Flow made up by Sah and a Les Mills Release number #whatever?  Can we tell the difference between trained and educated professionals and 'just get in there and take it'?  I don't think we can, can we?  What education and training sytem?  What skilled and knowledgeable professionals?  What's that, Sah?  Don't stand upside down, you say?  It's the head stands and the hand stands that cause the endometriosis.  Really?  While the medical 'professionals' are sticking them with the endoscope.  You think?  The leg postition matters?  We should experimetn with leg position while we f*ck them with the scope...  Hmmm..  Good thinking!!!  </p>
