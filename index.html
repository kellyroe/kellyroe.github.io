    <p>The Australian Constitution says that New Zealand is a state of Australia.  But the Constitution of Australia does not apply to Australia.  They don't have to supply voting papers etc to New Zealanders.  The New Zealand Education and Training Act says that domestic adults are elgiible to be enrolled in programmes they have applied to.  But the laws don't apply to the Universities of New Zealand.  They refuse to supply applications to domestic adults.  They refuse to process applications from domestic adults.  They prevent and prohibit them applying and throw their applications way so as to fill up training programmes for things like Medicine and Law with teenagers.  There's really nothing in these garbage heap of waste lands..  They won't get work out to external examiners.  There's nothing more than a buch of bullies throwing their weight around.  Nobody home.  Nothing here.
