    <p>https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2022/11/expert-explains-why-sick-baby-can-t-just-be-given-blood-from-unvaccinated-people.html  It is good Professor Turner got to talk through some of her fears.  Let's see...  One person can't have x because if one person had it then 100 other people would have to have it and then 200 people would have to have it and then everybody would have to have it because we must all be forced to be all the same and not everybody can have it therefore one person can't have it.  Nobody can have it.  
    </p>

    <p>They do autologous (self) transfusion blood doping for sports (e.g., cycling).  Probably you can't with infants because you can only take so much at a time and there wouldn't be enough time to collect enough before the surgery.  And units don't last very long even when frozen.  Something something about iron toxicity in the context of old blood units where the cells burst or lyse...  Not sure about the surgery...  Stenosis was narrowing but the baby's heart and valves should still be growing...  I thought they don't get too upset about murmers in children (unless they are seeming oxygen deprived in the periphery) because the valves are still growing and they often sort themselves out over time..  Maybe there is scaring and scars won't grow.  ?  In which case things will only get worse as the unscarred parts do grow...  I thought they didn't like to replace valves in children because the replacements won't grow so they will need to be replaced again as the child grows...  I don't know... I wonder what went wrong.  If it was auto-immune...  If the surgery needs to happen or if it's just a...  Convenient test case for the courts.  To make some kind of a point, or something...  I don't know...</p>

    <p>I don't know much about blood transfusions / donations in NZ.  I know that they turn away quite a few people.  Saying that a person can't donate because they are a man who has had sex with a man and things like that.  I don't really understand why they won't let people donate on the grounds that they are apparently higher risk of having blood that might be infected with something.  I mean, they test the blood.  Right?  And it's unprotected sex that puts people at risk of HIV rather than who it is they had sex with.  I thought that was what the science was saying.  That condoms prevented HIV transmission.  It seemed more to do with politics and moral disgust at homosexuality than science.  Like the idea that anybody protesting outside the courthouse would have unclean blood.  Most people who got HIV in developed western nations got it from...  Blood transfusions.  But apparently they screen the blood now so that doesn't unintentionally happen anymore.  Unintentional.  It was.  Apparently.  Maybe the pool the blood before they batch screen or test it.  So they try and reduce the risk before pooling it and batch testing since they would have to throw away the whole batch if the batch tested positive (or pool it with a larger vat so the test didn't detect it anymore).  I think NZ blood is processed in Melbourne.</p>


    <p>I don't know the reasons why the parents want to be more particular about the blood.  If it is based on misunderstanding of science, or what.  Science tells us fairly unequivocally that autologous (self) donation is best.  But it is not so easy to roll it out to the masses.  The prohibitions are political, in other words.  And most people in the US don't have their own personal repository of organs (or a clone someplace else to be harvested in an emergency) or freezer full of their own blood (unless they are blood doping for sports) or storage facilities for people to freeze things like umbilical cord blood or eggs or whatever for their own personal use down the track (perhaps, as a form of insurance)...  And we have to follow however many years  behind...  And Australia stopped sending blood overseas for processing (to the US) but NZ has to follow however many years behind...  They will ship back whatever blood products are deemed by them to be suitable for our unique socio-cultural slave-colony environment, one can only suppose. It is pretty crap that when people feel very strongly about an issue..  The health system doesn't even try and be accommodating.  It's always this snap quick judgment (and once made done done cannot be undone) that it can't happen.  It won't happen.  They are committed to it not happening.  And that's an end to it.  Remembering the stuff around vaccination.  To start with people who wanted a vaccination couldn't have one because they were too busy trying to force people who didn't want one to have one.  THe problem was that everybody wanted one therefore not everyone therefore noone could have one.  NO, that wasn't the problem.  The problem was that everybody had to have one because otherwise nobody would have one.  No..  That's not the problem.  The problem is small minds can only comprehend that what one does everybody must do.  Everybody must be entirely the same expendible replaceable units.  You can't do x because if you got to do x then everybody would have to be forced to do x and that's not sustainable.  Therefore no to you.  My way or the highway.  No, my way or the Government will force the Governments will upon the people, anyway.  Look at the fruits of their labors.  Most under-valued people in the world.  Kept by them.  By design.   </p>  

    <p>They ask for family donors for some people to have organ transplants.  In New Zealand.  I remember hearing about one lady who had 3 kidney transplants.  I remember thinking it was strange since some people never get a kidney transplant.  Maybe she had a 'lucky' type so it was easy for them to take a kidney from someone who they found...  I don't think the courts delivered much in the way of sanction to disincentivise them taking organs against the wishes of the family...  There was one case of that...  Where he said 'no, I don't want you to take the organs' and they took them anyway.  The courts established that... The third donated one was from her brother.  Donated specifically for or to her.  Not part of a central system where people are matched according to need or whatever.  Given to her.  I don't know if the public health system does organ transplants or if they are done in the private hospitals now.  I guess the private hospitals use the blood.  But they aren't taking blood from most people so...  Who knows.  Who knows how everything fails to function.  I don't know why her brother didn't donate the first one...  But she eventually rejected the first two and her brother donated the third one in the hope that she wouldn't reject it so quickly.  They allowed her brother to donate her a kidney.  But I guess all our blood gets shipped to Australia and they decide what blood (if any) is appropriate for our unique socio-cultural environment and we take what we are given (lucky to get anything at all).  Take it or leave it.  Or, do what the government says when they say because they say or they will take your baby away.  Do something to it (to try and make it less acceptable to the Mother down the line) and so on...  The reasons they have about the cleanliness of blood are strange...  Not scientific I mean to say.  Politics etc.  Saying that men who have had sex with men cannot donate blood.  Instead of saying that it was about unprotected sex, for example.  It isn't science.  It is politics. </p> 

    <p>I guess Shane Reti or Ashley Bloomfield or Ayesha or the Hamilton West guy can put their MBChB's to good use and weigh in on the Medical I mean political reasons why everybody must be forced to...  Only treat the involuntary.  Only 'treat'...  I'm surprised they haven't imprisoned the parents in the name of psychiatry and given the baby the blood and operation already...  I guess the answer to that lies in all the money all the money all the money all the money all the money for the courts...</p>  

    <p>Was the objection to antibodies being present?  That doesn't make much sense.  They could find antibodies in people who hadn't been immunised.  I was pretty sure that the Covid antibodies were filtered out, anyway.  That's how they make the treatment for Covid.  Wasn't it?  The emergency one to be given to a few special snowflakes only.  The one where they give you antibodies.  Who do you think made those antibodies?  The rabbits?  I thought the antibodies were harvested from blood donations and blood donors.  Interesting, then, because they make the Covid emergency antibody treatments available to...  Well, you or I couldn't just walk in off the street and have treatmen for Covid.  Clearly.  Some special snowflakes.  So it seems that the National Blood Service (of Australia?) is perfectly willing to do more catered and specific treatments.  In the private hospitals was it?  I guess that would make best sense of why they feel particulaly about sending so many public people away...  </p>  

    <p>The courts will probably make it be about the false beliefs of the parents.  Make it hinge on that.  That way the judgement will be easier.  LIke it was easier for Justice Toogood to make a bunch of false assertions in his judgment, and easier for him to ignore evidence that was presented, and easier for him to ignore half the laws.  I can't imagine that the Justices write their own judgments, anyway.  That doesnt' seem plausible to me.  The interns?  What do they do?  WHat are they...  Clerkships?  Something like that.  The Justices get a recent law graduate to do their bidding.  Right?  With entry to Law being 17 or 18 that means they are 22 or something?  I don't know if they graduate before clerkship or if they don't do what they are told or party party party with the Justices or whatever then the Univerity of AUckland takes back their Degree.  Not sure how things don't work...</p>

    <p>People die in the hospitals all the time.  People actively wanting treatment and actively asking for help.  But no no no no no we must only 'treat' the involuntary.  We must devote all our time and energy and resources forcing people against their will.  The doctors and nurses don't have other things they could be getting on with?  They have to focus on this case because it's always so much more fun to force.  Right?  No other patients...  Nothing better to be getting on with in their time...  The only people in the hospital  need to  be there by court order against their will.  In the  name of we know better science what is best science for you.  Make it be about them having bad science beliefs.  Only the science says that autologous blood is best.  And psychology says that forcing people to do things against their will to express your power...  Well...  How much lower can people's faith or confidence or belief in the health system..  The Judiciary and so on and so forth, actually go?  I mean...  Strange how everybody apparently or allegedly wants to move to the US if they had opportunity to do so..  And yet we won't work towards any of the things we value about the place over here, in these lands.  The freedom to be stupid.  Even.  To not have to justify how you aren't stupid to have your choices upheld.  I understand it involves or is about a kid.  You don't get to take guardianship and impose your will and then hand it back.  That's not how responsible guardianship works.  If the state isn't going to look after it until it's been consented for sex at 16 with a pediatrician or sports coach or teacher or whatever...  Or look after it until it's 20 when it can decide for itself if it wants to apply to university...  Or whatever...  Then stay out of it.  So many people are asking for and wanting treatment.  But they aren't good enough.  YOu have eto target the involuntary non voluntary.  Go after their children.  You want people to not present to health services anymore?  Go ram raid instead of attending schools who knowingly employ pedophiles and refuse to get students work to external examiners?  The farce of it all...</p>               

    <p>I would question the compency of the 'surgeons'.  Are there even radiology reports?  What do the radiology reports say?  You have the right to a second opinion..  What does an independent radiologist say, then?  I mean to say, what evidence is there of stenosis in or to a valve?  Is it something they have seen or found before in children of that age?  What happens if it goes untreated vs if it is treated?  Does it right itself?  What state or condition is the kid in?  Apparently the kid seems fine...   How was the issue or problem discovered in the first place, then?  What reason do we have to beleive...  That they aren't simply trying to get more and more and more and more money out of the government for performing an 'operation' that isnt' needed nor desired nor asked for??  Are things really that bad in our hospitals?  What are the credentials of the surgeons?  Where did they graduate?  More than 5 years old?  Speak English?  From New Zealand?  Struck off the register for incompetence or malevolence or both someplace else in the world?  How long have they been here for?  Doing a little edu-tourism?  Who is going to do the operation anyway?  A bulding apprentice from Christchurch, was  it?  Are they going to do a piolet safety check-list of who is in the OR before opening?  What kind of valve are they going to be using?  From whom?  When will it need to be replaced with a new valve since the kid is still growing?  So many unanswered questions that don't make any sense...  Teh whole thing seems like really rather ta lot of a set up.  I understnd someone is latching onto it as an interesting case where parents want better treatment than the one being imposed by the state.  But that's why some people wnted to opt out of Covid Vaccination.  Because they did not have any confidence or faith in the NZ Government to provide certain things.  For example, to administer the correct dose (that is to say dilute and administer according to the instructions printed on the side of the vial).  Why?  Because we hear of people being given expired doses.  We hear of people being given incorrect dilutions.  And the government pays the victims?  The government pays the victims?  That's what it meeeeeeeeeeeeans to take responsibility for decisions.  To over-ride people's own choices (even if you think their own choices are stupid).  Who pays the cost or the price of the governments stupid decisions?  Becuase they were too stupid to know how stupid they were?  The people alwyas pay, the people always pay, the people never stop paying for the stuplid decisios of the stupid government.  Who overrides the decisiosn of the people and never seems to be accountable for any of the stupid bullying decisions that they make.</p>

    <p>Medical Ethics Professor was writing for the New Zealand Medical Students Journal, I thought.  It was unclear to me why since he was a Professor of Philosophy and not a Medical Student...  But, anyway, he was also writing with people about how the Oraka Tamariki uplifts were good ethics.  Because of the trackign they were doing showing that they could identify children as vulnerable and then track them over time.  Tracking how identifying children as vulnerable early on meant they could then record that they didn't have educational attainment and they could then record that they were imprisoned by the government.  So keeping all the data on that and how the government treats them means that that somehow justifies the government taking them away from their parents and putting them into state institutions in the name of science, now, and in the name of ethics, now.  So they can be bused in state care and pimped out by the likes of Dr Leeks and so on.  To have their theses (for example) not getting given to externals examiners (so they can record low levels of educational attainment) and throwing away their applications to things like medical school (so that the likes of Dr Leeks can be the only game in town).  </p>

    <p>I was a firm believer in vaccines and being vaccinated and so on until...  Until the government refused to get my thesis out to external examiners in a timely fashion.  Refused to work to put things right internally.  Refused to process applications to Medical School in order to preferentially select teengers (largely, by the seems of it, for the purposes of abusing them and making them complicit with crimes that are currently being undertaken in our health system, and also for the purposes of having them pay the university while they are put to some sort of kind of pretend work in our hospitals bullying and abusing people because they aren't in the position to know that's what's going on).  To learn that infants died in Samoa because they were given MMR vaccine that had been incorrectly dilutted with expired anasthetic solution instead of saline.  Apparently it was malevolent nurses who did that.  But who signed off on completion of that nurses qualification?  Who hired her?  Who threw away all the other applications until she was the only alternative?  What kind of faith or hope or belief is actually reasonable or rational to have in the health system of New Zealadn given that they choose to conduct themselves so?  Given that the courts refuse to deliver meaningful conseqences or sanctions to wrongful deaths and sexual violations and so on?  They refuse to train and employ radiologists.   How do they do surgeries without radiology reports? Why the hell do they think there is any kind of problem with the valves?  Who in their right mind could provide informed consent for their child to have open heart surgery in the health system of New Zealand?  It just doesnt' make any sense...  Who is going to be working the autoclave?  Who is going to check everythign that is supposed to be on the tray is on the tray at closing?  It just doesnt' make any sense...  </p>

    <p>Politics.  Politicising the issue.  100 protestors.  Apparently if the courts find that the Government does not have the authority to take temporary custody of a kid in order to impose it's will (maybe give Dr Leeks permission to do whatever he wants with impunity over a weekend and then give the kid back) then that will be a victory to the anti-science anti-vaccers.  But none of that follows.  Taking the kid for the weekend and doing anything you want and then throwing it back to the parents (with some vague promise of getting in there later and doing it again when the kid is older and needs a new valve?)...  Why do you need open heart surgery for a valve replacemetn?  Don't they do those with scopes??  Laproscopic?  You go in through an artery, I thought...  Why does the kid need blood units for the procedure at all?  Politicising...  Politicising...  Where is my credit for my 1 year degree?  What was my rank order score for MBChB in 2019 and again in 2020?  I was ELIGIBLE (domestic adult who has attained the age of 20 years).  The algorithm for calculating GPA was published FOR THE PURPOSES OF ACCOUNTABILITY.  BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR YOUR REFUSAL TO FOLLOW THE FREAKING LAWS THAT YOU WROTE FOR YOURSELVES TO FOLLOW.  I beat you at your own stupid stupid stupid game.  You see.  Hurry up...  All the delays do is pronounce to NZ that this nation is not even trying to be rule by law.  No health system...  Nothing to see nothing here.   Nothign nothing nothing at all.  HURRY UP.  The courts are delay delay delay delay delay...  Delay.  Nothing here.  Nobody home.</p>

    <p>I don't know.  Likely the whole thing is a farce.  For the billings.  Fake surgeries.  There are TV screens about in all the OR's.  I would imagine that they are filming everything that goes on in the OR's. I mean, it wouldn't be responsible or credible if they were not.  It wouldnt' make any sense that they would not be filming everything that happens in all of the OR's.  So that means the patients family should be able to watch the live stream.  Right?  Do people remember the show ER?  There was a glass viewing wall for the purposes of studnets, apparently.  For the purposes of family being able to sit there since family were not allowed to scrub in...  Maybe it was a TV thing for better scriptwriting.  Better drama.  But it makes a lot of sense for the purposes of accountability.  Of course it would be hard to see what's going on that far back.  Overhead camera positioned close to the overhead lights or lighting would make most sense.  Of course.  Why?  For the purposes of accountabiltiy.  To ensure they are actually doing what it is that tehy are billing for.  To check that they aren't billing up or invoicing for procedures that were never performed.  There was some study I read at some point about how arthroscopic knee surgery outcomes were comparable to placebo procedures.  What you do is you give the patient anasthetic and then you go through a play...  Drama production.  Theatrical performance.  You give them a little cut and maybe even push a scope into the joint cavity and move it around a bit.   But you don't actually debride anything...  Then you stitch them up and after some recovery time they say tehy feel better.  And the hospital feels  better, too, because they bill the procedure, you see.  And some people are paid quite a lot of money for keeping up the scummy hoax of a facade.  I remember going to a talk at Auckland about how they were doing experiments (but they didn't call them that because that would have been unlawful, most likely) giving people saline instead of actual blood units.  Giving them water to pump up or increase or improve the volume of the blood after blood loss.  How much you could dilute their blood, in other words, of things like platelets and oxygen and carbon dioxide carrying red cells and whatever B cells and proteins and other things were floating around in the blood...  Diluting all of these down and seeing how many of them would still pull through because it was the volume that was the main problem and that could be fixed with saline.  ANyway, it meant they could sort of practice hooking up the bags and inserting the needles and so on.  Going through the motions.  Doing something.  Without using any blood units.  Not sure how they were billing that as a procedure.  As a treatment.  Not an experiment...  But a justification on how or why it is that Melbourne wouldnt' need to send blood units to New Zealand.  Our unique socio-cultural environment can make better use of saline in the hospital.  Not placebo...  Not relegated to an exeperimental control group.  Science says it's the best treatment.  Therefore most ethical, clearly.</p>

    <p>I am not sure what to make of Tim Dare.  I don't know him very well.  But I can stay with him and his wife over the weekend while I'm trying to figure out what to do about the University of Auckland not properly processing studnets work...  Right?  Hugs to you and your wife...  I do know that he should have been made professor years and years and years and years and years and years ago.  Or not..  How many professors are there supposed to be?  Just the one in every department was it?  But I guess he had to wait for Rosalind Hursthouse to die.  Is she dead yet?  That's how that goes?  Did Rosalind ever manage to get a PhD student to take up that room she was advertising in her house?  Cheap rent in exhange for helping her carry her bags about, or what have you?  Did anybody take her up on that?  Did she ever get their work out to external examiners, then?  Or for how many decades were they supposed to play bag boy for her?   Handing her all their work so she could keep them as slave?  Various people from Auckland were apparently 'helping' Tahua write his thesis at various points. He was pretty prolific, I remember...  So they refused to get his work to externals...  Then he got really really depressed (that's what happens when you work isn't processed or progressed -- you start to shut down).  And then the problem was that he was depressed, apparently.  Depressed by the University since they weren't processing or progressing his work. </p>
    <p> Then they gave him his PhD after I don't know how many decades...  How many rewritings nd rewritings nd rewritings.  Does he have full time employment?  Or do thehy write him up as having been incapacitated by the government?  And then they needed to help him get publications, apparently...  WHich mostly involves not getting his work to publishers.  So best I can see and figure.  So very very very very helpful.  SO very very very very ethical.  Really living things.  But, anyway...  If Tim has to work for how many years to get Professor then how many years is he going to force the next generation to slave?  They stopped signing off on the PhDs for the most part.  Anybody who they thought had the capacity to be productive...  They shut them down.  The idea/l is to take take take from the undergrads and so on.  Bully them to death.  I suppose once Tahua is dead we will see his work appearing with various other people as authors of it.  That seems likely.  The 'Professors' are mostly managers, by the seems of it.  The Government pays them very well to shut everybody else down.  But then they don't really have anybody to talk to...  Oh, the anti-vaccers.  I see.  Of course.  There are quite a few reasons why people didn't want to be vaccinated.  When you look at how the government chooses to abuse and treat various of the people it isn't surprising that people would not have faith or trust or belief or hope in the government.  What is actually most surprising bout NZ is how oppressed the people are kept in this part of the world.  The protests etc were (according to our own government) backrolled from overseas.  That is or means to say things were kept so very severely oppressed here...  I mean..  I find it hard to get over that they imprisoned Brian Tamaki in Mt Eden prison.  Various wrongful deathbriners and rapists and the like aren't put in prison because apparently there isn't any room to keep them...  But Brian Tamaki is such a threat to the NZ Government that the NZ Government..  What?  Orders him to be locked up...  On political grounds or for political reasons.  Bully-lands.  Not a functioning democracy at all.  Not a functioning health system.  Series of prison or detention camps up and down the land. </p>

    <p>You see the use that they put the information to.  The use they chose to make of my Masters thesis on delusions.  If the process or proecedure for making people with delusions less delusional is thus and so then we know how to induce delusions...  Thats the real aim or the goal or the purpose or the point.  To incapacitate people at will.  So the Government can impose it's own will in the name of people being incpacitated in the name of psychiatry.  But why stop there?  You can incapacitate people in the name of other things in Medicine, also. You have a heart problem.  So stay home.  If you don't do what we say then we will court order you to do what we say in the name of science.  In the name of Ethics.  Being a bully.  Very very high rates of wrongful death and being bullied to death in this part of the world.  And the state will not accept or admit that the primary bullies in this part of the world are the people the government chooses to put on government payroll.  How much does the governmetn choose to pay the likes of Chris Whelan to refuse to process a single complaint from any student about the Universities of NZ?  He was the only alternative.  Every other applicant had their application thrown away.  Not even pretending to be a democracy or meritocracy or rule by law anymore.  Unless.  Well..  Who was the only judge in town?  What are they going to find now?  I guess they write, at length (or at least sign their pawprint to) the government doing anything it wants with complete and utter immunity from any responsibility at all for any of the harms arising from their bully decisions.  I guess otherwise the Univerity of Auckland would simpliy find that they don't have any records of their enrollment in teh LLB qualification...  Australiain Payroll no work-y anymore...</p>

    <p>The Univesrity of Auckland publically marketed the 'Health Science' pathway to Medicine as a route that was particularly suitable for students with strong background in the Arts and Humanities.  They made particular mention of it as a pathway to Medicine for students with strengths in languages and law.  That was a particular way that they had of marketing that programme.  Then various graduates of various programmes enrolled in it.  The idea being that their GPA was not high enough for them to get entry on the basis of their undergraduate degree so enrolling in the first year of the Health Science pathway was an opportunity for them to bring their GPA up for selection to MBChB.  That was why various people were enrolled in that first year Health Science pathway or programme.  So, graduate students of anthropogy and sociology and so on and so forth.  Various things like that.  Enrolling in that programme with the intention of bringing up their full time GPA for the purposes of selection.  Then students were told that they weren't allowed to reference the way they had been taught in their university degrees.  I mean to say, using direct quotes to directly quote from blocks of text that were difficult or requiring much discussion or whatever.  Maybe because of ambiguoitites.  Lots of difficult words to parse.  Real discussion of the meanings.  Like..  Much of what comes out of the UN.  Discussion documents.  The definitions of health and so on.  Things like that.  They were telling us that we were not allowed to use direct quotes in our academic work.  We were to rephrase and assert that our rephrasing was what it was that was said.  And then they would asses our rephrasing on the basis of acceptabiltiy for or to the government, I suppose.  The idea was to assess us for our natural inclination or willingness to play government censor.  That seemed to be the idea of it.  Say sometihng the government likes to hear.  Then provide a reference or two so as to confer or convey academic authority or credibility.  Or something like that.  Apparently the Univesrity has the academic freedom to value whatever it is that they value.  To fail out of the qualification anybody who dares hand them an academically credible academic essay.</p>

    <p>They failed me for Public Health.  My first essay was given 30 per cent.  I complained about that.  Asked them to get my work to an independent examiner so it could be externally examined on it's academic merits.  They refused to do that.  The next essay was also given a low failing grade.  Apparently they don't choose me and that's what it is or means to have a passing grade for that course.  They have the right to bully anybody they want into leaving the university.  Irrevokably ruining people's GPA.   </p>

    <p>But the thing was that I wasnt' enrolled in that course in order to improve my GPA.  That wasn't why I was there.  SO all I needed to do was drop out of the programme of study so I wasn't full time.  My full time GPA was therefore or thereby preserved.  And they can't say I'm 'ineligible' because my qualification was conferrred too long ago.  Because they still acknowledge their own qualifiations that were conferred longer ago than mine were.  But actually really because the law says that domestic adults are eligible.  So they dont' get to decide who is and who is not eligible.  They were requird to enter my full time GPA into their algorithm in fact.  And they refuse to do it.  Firstly, they outright lied.  Saying they entered it nd it was 8.0.  But forcing a student to take 2 years to do a 1 year masters research is not full time.  So my MA grade doesn't count.  So actually my last 3 years of full time study were 8.6.  But they are pretending to be too stupid (because they are actully too malevolent).  But you can see they don't get to say that they have a functioning University...  They aren't grading students work properly.  They arent' grading it on it's academic merits.  The University of Auckland is not a functioning University...</p>

    <p>It is all a big scam, you see.  They aren't selecting the students on the basis of the algorithm they publish for the purposes of accountability, at all.  They publish the algorithm to proclaim to everybody that they are not accountable.  Look at the decisions they choose to make.  They choose to preferentially select the children of the administration etc etc.  They choose to preferentially select Dr Leeks.  How many students did he refuse to sign off on completion of their internship with him because they had a problem with what he was doing?  How many students did he refuse to train to be psychiatrists because they had a problemw with what he was doing?  What happened when people found out about what he was doing?  They transferred him to Melbourne so he could continue on his crimes over there against people from Melbourne.  They knowingly employed him knowing he was a problem and allowed him (enabled him) to keep on being a problem over there until it got more widely known what he was up to.  And then we are supposed to believe that he died.  Unlikely.  Where did they ship him to next?  Who is he offending against (while being employed by Governments of Australasia) now?  Where is the accountabiltiy?  Nobody there..  Nothign home...  They WILL NOT follow their selection algorithm when it comes to processing my application.  They WILL NOT get work I have done out to external or independent examiners in  timely fashion.  It is not at all  because they believe externals would fail me.  The reason they refuse to get my work out to externls is because they believe it likely that externals would pass me.  I mean to say New Zealand intentionally stabotages it's own people.  The extent of the stupid defies credibility.  Malevolent intent.  Death instinct and all that. New Zealand choses to be costly fitness trap.  No self-preservation instict at all.  Not even a hint of 'try'.</p>

    <p>Is Grant Gillett still alive?  Last I saw he looked like he had a stroke or something.  SOmeone kicked his front teeth in.  He wasn't bathing.  It would be rude to say such things of the Professor in the CEntre for Excellence for Ethics at Otago...  He was a neurosurgeon at Oxford, apparently.  That's how he gets to be head of centre for research excellence in ethics at Otago.  I guess he knew his stuff, then, when it came to matters of how many neurosurgeons for a functioning unit and so on and so forth.  What's his name..  The other guy...  Who didn't know his extended mind / embodiment stuff.  Who didn't want his studnets writing about it.  Philosophy is copy-paste indistinguishable from teh outputs of a computer programme. So they can cry cry cry (actually proclaim!) how the students are only allowed to plagarise in these parts.  No place for originality or creativity or academic freedoms.  Maybe Grant did die.  That's how Jing Bo got promoted to Professor.  Because there can only be one and it's time for him.  BEcause the other guy must be about dead yet...  Riiiight.  Just waiting waiting waiting for various people to die.  You can see why they don't want me to do Medicine.  Right?  I mean...  THey would happily kepe me in teir houses because they seem to have confidence that I won't kill them if I get opportunity.  But they want to keep me all to and for themselves.  I guess.  Why would they want me to go do Medicien?  I thoguht they would be happy about my not being a competitor.  That's right.  You do the ethics.  You can be Philsopher.  You take it.  You take it.  It's soooo competitive.  Well, if you want it that badly, that much, you take it then.  I'm not going to fight you for it.  You can have it.  You win.  You are the only game in town.  Notn sure who is going to engage with you in print...  But we don't seem to want to have academic journals where academics actually engage in academics...  What a f*cking farce.  Most people think that the trouble with NZ is just a little bit dim.  Disingenuous.  Like...  That TV show.  The guys who thought they made it in New York.  Musicians.  The Ambassador...  That's the way they play or pretend to be.  Like the trouble is there aren't enoguh people and these were the best people they could find (the most competent the most skilled etc).  The problem is there isn't enoguh people and that's how come we are stuck giving many portfolios to Chris Hipkins.  There aren't enough people so Ashley neeed to remain even after failing to do his job within the law.  And so on.  But the problem is really the psychopathy.  Malevolence.  It's sooooo competitive.  People mlust keep slaves.  Very very very attached to the idea of being top or head of the hierarchy.  That's why they sucked up being little b*tches for so long, apparently.  Just biding their time.  There is no opt out or opt off.  It's the costly fitness trap that has been decided upon.  NO ideal of equality, here.  Replaceable expendible units and take your luck, maybe if you suck up enough for enough decades then you will get slaves all of your own.  You can get paid millions and millions to withhold healthcare from people who want it and ask for it (and millions and millions and millions to force abuses in the name of 'healthcare').  It's sooooo competitive...</p>
