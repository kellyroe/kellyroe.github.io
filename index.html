            <p>All these others, who the ANU says they graduated.  All these others, who went into permanent paid employment positions post-doctoral positions.  All these others...  The entire time that I was at the ANU I never saw anybody with reports from external examiners.  The entire time I was at the ANU I never saw anybody give a publically scheduled oral examination or oral defence to defend their thesis in response to the reports of external examiners.  Apparently they all did enough for paid employment.  Where is my paid employment?  How is it that they say that I haven't done enough?  Let's see the work that they did, then, over the comparable time period.  They don't get to say that my work is crap because that's not how external examination works.  What education and training system?  It's where the best and the brightest go to die.  The death camps.  The extermination camps.  There's nobody there,  hey.  What's that Sterelny?  It's soooo hostile.  It's soooo competitive.  It's been taken over  by psychopaths and there isn't anything there.  People will give their eye teeth for paid employment it's soooo competitive!!!  Where are his eye teeth then?  Is it dead yet?  It's well over the age of 65 and it's on payroll, still?  What education and training system?  There isn't anything there.  What a f*cking farce of a joke of a hoax of a f*cking scummy scam.</p>

            <p>They want to say that people owe the government however much to repay the cost of their training.  THey enrol people in programmes of study they never even applied to be enrolled in.  They won't actually employ skilled people to teach them.  They won't do it.  All these people on payroll and their theses never went out for external examination!  THey didn't have a publically scheduled oral defence!  But they are on payroll to teach, are they?  What teaching?  What courses did Sterelny teach when he was paid Professor of the Australian National University?  ANy courses?  Any courses at all?  What education and training programme?  It takes the work from some -- and it reattributes authorship to people already on payroll.  It can't even explain it's own work much of the time.  Gee I wonder why that might be.  What a hoax of a sham of a scummy scummy scam.  There's  nothing there, hey.  The millions and millions and millions that the governments have under-paid.  How many years of paid employment am I entitled to for the work that I did for how many years as an enrolled student?</p>

            <p>Know why we don't have a health system?  Because it's soooo hostile and soooo competitive.  Nobody actually wants anybody else to live.  Is it dead yet?  We can hope and we can pray.  What education and training system?  There isn't anything there, hey.</p>

            <p>University of Auckland employees said that I needed to complete a new qualification from a NZ University to be eligible to study MBChB.  They payroll them to say these things.  Have you read the education and training act?  It says that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible to be enrolled in the programme of study they have applied to.  But they won't process applications from domestic adults.  They fill up the tertiary education institutions with teenagers.  Because the law says the teenagers (under 20) are entitled to a free secondary education.  So they enrol them in tertiary study recording debt against their name.   Because that's what free secondary education means.  It means the government records levels of debt against their name saying they have enrolled them in tertiary courses that they never even applied to be enrolled in.</p>

            <p>They won't get work out to externals for external examination.  There isn't an education and training system, at all.  There isn't anything there. </p>

            <p>Do you wonder where all the doctors go?  I mean, they have graduation ceremonies for people after 3 years of tertiary study (graduating them when they turn 20 with levels of debt recorded against their name) and then after 4 years with their honors degrees.  They graduate them 2x.  To make up the numbers, one can only suppose.  So that it is less obvious that people don't graduate with MBChB or PhD's.  They will only graduate them when their social media profile is indistinguishable from the outputs of a computer programme, one can only suppose.  So they can say that they got paid employment overseas.  That's where they all went.  Posting photos of their lunch, or whatever it is that they do on social media.  Generate post-modernist essays, or similar.</p>

            <p>There isn't anything there.  There isn't anybody home.</p>

            <p>The millions and millions and billions of dollars that the government owes the people for their wages.  They underpay the workers.  Then they pay them even less because they are paying back their loans.  Then they pay them even less  because they are saving for their retirement.  But that's okay, various government employees own however many rental properties and there's never any shortage of beds for the kiddies!  THen when it's time for us to pay them it's time for them to go away.  To be replaced by new kiddies.  What education and training system?  There isn't anything there.  THey won't get the work out to externals.</p>

            <p>When did Nick Southwood get reports from external examiners?  When was  his oral examination?  When did Rachel Brown get reports from externals?  When was her oral examination?  When did Daniel Stoljar get reports from externals?  When was his oral defence?  How about Kim Sterelny?  When did he get reports  from externals?  His oral defence?  How about Paul Griffiths?  Any of them?  ANy of them at all?  ANy reports from externals?  ANy oral defences?  Did any of them even graduate?  Did they hire doctoral gowns and have their photos taken shaking hands with the vice chancellor?  Have their abstract read out at graduation?  Did any of them get a Degree? To put on the wall of their office at work?  What education and training system?  There doesn't seem to be anything there, hey.</p>

            <p>WHat was their work output in the 2 years prior to their 1 year external examination process?  Or maybe they worked for 3 years, did they,  before their research was externally examined?  Maybe they did a Carl Brusse and made them all do 2 x PhD's.  At least 2.  Over...  Was it a decade?  How many years did they claim to keep Carl Brusse re re re re enrolled as a doctoral student?  What happened to his first thesis?  All the work that he did on personal identity?  Did he give it to the Princeton people to pass off as their own?  Maybe to give it to one of their studnets so they could go into paid employment claiming Carl's first thesis as their own.  That's why no oral defences,  hey.  Can't even, won't even explain their own work.  Ever wonder why Sterelny can't else won't discuss any of his supposed early work.  The work that was supposedly enough for him to be given paid employment.  The work he did with Frank.  Supposedly.  Etc.  Why he can't else won't explain any of it.  Can't else won't discuss it.  Oooooh.  It's soooo competitive!  It's sooooo hostile!!! Indeed.  There's actually nothing there.</p>

            <p>How much is supposed to be enough for permanent employment.  I haven't done enough?  Really?  I'm supposed to go along to the unemployment things with the various people kept on payroll to tell me that I'm unskilled and unqualified and...  All the bullsh*t made up excuses about why they are in paid employment and not me.  It's sooooo competitive!!!  All the people payrolled to mismanage bully and abuse me.  It's soooooo hostile!!!!  It's soooooo competitive!!!!! </p>

            <p>What doctors?  What nurses?  What teachers?  There's nothing there.  They won't enrol people in programmes they apply to.  They won't graduate people who did the work (and only the people who did the work) for their qualifications.  They won't publically advertise jobs much of the time.  They won't hire the most qualified person for the position.  THe office of the Ombudsman and the PRivacy Commission re re re re re advertise for postions of all levels.  From most senior to most junior.  From permanent to 3 year to 2 year to 1.  I haven't even done enough for a 1 year temporary postition!  What a f*cking joke of a farce of a f*ckign scummy scam.  There's nothing there.</p>

            <p>Sterelny says `If we don't have to graduate you we don't have to graduate anyone at all!'  Indeed.  They graduated the likes of you.  F*cking hell.  There's nothing there.</p>
