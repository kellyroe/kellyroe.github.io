                            <article>

                                <p>
                                The work that I had done in the Philosophy of Psychopathology was all based on the assumption that the aim was to help people rather than abuse people.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                So, for example, extending work that had been done on delusions to a form of talk therapy that was being introduced to New Zealand at the time so that therapy may become part of a viable treatment for delusions.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                If the aim or the point or the purpose of a diagnosis of delusions (related diagnosis of psychosis) is to keep people impoverished and abused in psychiatric institutions (detain them in conditions of torture, even), then you can see quite a different function for diagnosing and prospects for 'treating' delusions, however.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                New Zealand has been exposed to Psychiatry.  New Zealand has the idea of it.  Such that people present to GPs or the ED, asking for help from Psychiatry, specifically.  They seem to envisage a combination of a clinician  being able to excluding medical causes for their concerns, prescribing medication as may be appropriate, and monitoring the prescriptions in conjunction with regular psychotherapy.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                New Zealand does not appear to have Psychiatry.
                                </p>

                                <p>`Sane in insane places' was an experiment that was done (or was an idea of an experiment that was done) in psychiatric facilities in the US.  The idea was that people presented to the ED saying they heard voices say things like 'thump' and 'thud'.  The idea was to see how they would be treated.  To record whether they were admitted as in-patients to psychiatric facilities, for how long they were kept in psychiatric facilities.  There is controversy over whether the experiment was done, or whether it was done the way it is recorded as having been done, but it is interesting to think about what would happen to people if they were to present similarly to EDs in New Zealand.  For how long would they be kept in the psychiatric facilities of New Zealand?  Would they be able to get psychiatric assessments, at all, or would that not be possible since people presenting to the ED with suicidality etc are, sometimes, not able to get psychiatric assessments, at all.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I did not intend to try and replicate that experiment.  But I did know of it.  I am very concerned, indeed, that our hospital system is functioning more as an unlawful detention camp than a hospital.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                In 2020 I presented to the ED of the Auckland City Hospital seeking treatment for a physical complaint.  Previous injury has resulted in disfigured and numb toes.  I had been walking extensively during lock-down and ended up with nails coming off, bacterial infection, and I was concerned about possible hookworm infestation from walking barefoot in the Domain.  I went to the ED rather than my GP because, at that time, the media was reporting that GPs did not have PPE and, at that point in time, the EDs were relatively empty.
                                </p>  

                                <p>
                                They mocked my concern about parasites.  They  placed an IV line in my arm and held me in a seclusion room under 'duty of care' for more than 12 hours.  There were extensive cords from medical equipment.  There was no natural light.  There was an LED that was strobing and medical equipment with regular intemittent beeps.  I was not allowed to phone the police or a lawyer.  These sorts of sensory deprivation conditions are known to induce delusions in at least some subjects.   
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                They sectioned me for a 5 day observation hold under the Mental Health Act on grounds they believed me to be delusional because I had spoken about parasites.  They told me I was required to take medication (threatening to inject me if I did not take it orally) but no prescription had been charted.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                After 5 days observation they gave me a form saying I was now relased from involuntary status and was now to be kept in hospital under the Mental Health Act with 'voluntary' status.  They refused to allow me to leave for another few days keeping me locked up and they asserted that I was choosing to stay voluntarily in the hospital.  I was not.  They refused to allow me to phone the police.  They refused to supply a duty lawyer.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                So, the problem is not that there isn't enough resources for everybody who wants help to have help.  The problem is bullying and abuse.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                New Zealand does not have Universities.  We have slave / detention camps.  New Zealand doesn't have a health system.  We have slave / detention camps.
                                </p>


                                <p>
                                Here is my submission to the Court of Appeal that the Court of Appeal has deemed abandoned, because I did not have the money to pay $7,060 security for costs:

                                <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>.  I post them here so that you can judge for yourself whether or not you think that our courts are willing and / or able to uphold justice. 
                                </p>

                                <p>  Here are my submissions for the  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings on grounds that it had already passed judgment on the filings and would not revisit the issue.  I post them here so that you can judge for yourself whether or not you think that our courts are willing and / or able to uphold justice. 
                                </p> 

                                <p>
                                 The Australian Courts have Jurisdiction over the State of New Zealand.  Here is a <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Link </a> to why I say that.  They blow me off, only.  I don't have any reason to think the Australian Courts any more willing or able to uphold justice than the New Zealand Courts.  Australia keeps New Zealand as a detention or slave camp for Australia.  It seems to me that Australia is becoming more and more like New Zealand.  It is aiming to new lows.  I say this because of their decision to employ Sterelny at the Australian National University.  It seems to me 'The Evolved Apprentice' is something of a slavery manifesto about how to prevent and prohibit the development of skilled labor.  Australia does not have the capacity for it's own vaccine.  Submarine design plans.  Satellites.  Innovation.  The problem isn't that it doesn't have enough money it keeps on about how well the economy is doing.  The problem is something different, entirely.</p>

                                 <p>
                                You can see the work I did for the Australian National University for yourself on the Seminars and Writing page.  I don't know if various other students who were granted their PhD's will make similarly available the work that they did through their PhD including information about supervision meetings they received and concrete feedback they received on their written work so as to be signed off as having completed their PhD.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                You can see the work I did for the University of Waikato for yourself on the Writing page.  I don't know if various other studnets who were given Masters Degrees (if there actually are any) will make similarly available the work that they did through their Masters.  I wasn't expecting anybody to help me, at this point.  I'm not a teenager anymore and I understand the University Administration believes it's job is to delay and prevent and obstruct and prohibit and keep the students detained for as long as possible slaving for as long as possible and even then withholding their Degree.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                You can see the filings I did for the courts over on the Judicial Review page.  New Zealand wil not pay lawyers to do that kind of work.  You can see for yourself that the courts do not appear willing and / or able to uphold justice or find in the interests of justice.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                They will not extradite kim.com because he pays the courts.  I am thinking about the Chinese people who were working construction.  They accused them of over-staying and imprisoned them in Mt Eden and deported them before they could testify about not being paid their wages for working construction?  Am I remembering that right?  It seems to me that the NZ government doesn't have any problems throwing people into prison, denying them lawyers, and deporting them when they do not pay the courts pay the courts pay the courts pay the courts pay.  It is disingenuous to think that anything else is going on?
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I don't think it plausible that New Zealand wants skilled builders any more than to think New Zealand wants any of the people on the skilled migrant worker list.  That is to say, New Zealand Government will not pay people fair wages to work those jobs.  Will not acknowledge their qualifications.  I'm sure the New Zealand Government would love to enrol people into engineering Degrees.  I am also sure they will not acknowledge completion of the Degrees and will not pay people to work those jobs.  I don't understand what is happening where they would pay firms $1,000 per week (more than the apprentice is paid?) to work in first year construction and $500 per week to work as a second year construction worker.  I suppose the idea is to get them failing the first years so as to re-enrol them as first years.  To fail them at the end of second year and refuse to allow them to complete the third year of training.  Because they get more for having a first or second year apprentice.  No pay-off for having a third year apprentice or for graduating anybody at all.  New Zealand keeps slave or detention camps.  It will not train a workforce or acknowledge the skills that people aquire despite or in spite of them.
                                </p>

                                It's sooooooooo competitive.  It's sooooooo competitive that Australasia is doing sooooooooo well at the global competition.  It's really keeping up, there, with everything.  From arts and culture to science and tech.  All the things.  I am being sarcastic.  All the things Australasia does not have.  Design plans for nuclear submarines.  Design plans for vaccines.  Satellites...  The people with the capacity to do such things don't seem willing and / or able to function...  I don't knowk what will happen to the New Zealand Film Industry when International Community is getting more serious about not profiteering from slavery.  They will not pay the workers.  They will not pay the workers.  They will not pay the workers.  They will pay abusers and bullies and managers and administrators...  They will pay the slavers...  They will not pay the workers.  Won't do it.  Nope.  They won't pay for anything they can't get an unskilled person doing for free.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                New Zealand is a state of Australia and the money is bullshit.  The New Zealand dollar.  It is just to disguise how little they pay New Zealanders.  New Zealand won't acknowledge anybodies qualifications at all.  Australia won't acknowledge New Zealand qualifications.  I can't see any reasons for the New Zealand Divisions of anything (academics or things like medical specialist colleges) except insofar as they are about denying qualifiations.  I wonder how many psychiatrists are acknowledged by the NZ association.  I imagine the NZ association of comprised of people struck off the Australasian association.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                What Governments of the world treat their people worse than the NZ Goverment...  Most compliant popluation in the world...  There wouldn't have been any protests, at all, without international seed funding...
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                There is a real number that has been done on the New Zealand people...
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                There is no excuse for threats of violence.  I am not condoning them.  But the Univesrity of Otago chose to go out of their way to choose a teenager for a place in Health Science First year.  I don't know how much the government gave them for failing her and re-enrolling her in first year again.  I think it was likely very bad faith indeed that had them fail her for first year.  I mean...  They don't have to process applications from teenagers at all.  But they must have really believed in her capacity and motivation and so on to have chosen to take her money and enroll her in that programme of study.  And then they used that money to provide support services to the teenager? No?  They didn't?  What did they do with the money, then?
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I feel so badly for her that they failed her for first year.  It's like deporting the construction workers when it's time to pay them.  I've taught at various Universities over the years and my understanding was that you don't fail first years -- but some of them choose to fail themselves.  I don't mean that in a gaslighting way.  I mean that some of them will disengage.  For various reasons.  Not many, but some of htem will disengage.  Not do the work.  Not want to pass.  Not want to do the course anymore.  Be upfront about not putting in the time or effort.  You get a few who disengage.  But you don't fail first year students who are trying.  They had the capacity to be enrolled in the problem and they are doing the work.  So you don't fail them for their Degree.  I don't understand what the hell is going on with Auckland and Otago that they think they are entitled to enrol teenagers, they are entitled to take their money.  They are entitled to keep them in residential halls that are about communal living etc at the expense of students who want to propritise quiet study.  They are entitlted to fail students who have done the work.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                International community needs to do something about the administration of New Zealand.  I think that Jacinda has admitted to Harvard, already, for the cameras, that, in her opinion, none of the political party people are in parliament who didn't cheat on their election campaign.  I think there is something like that.  How much money was invested for them to purchase a win at the election, effectively.  Things are very corrupt, here, and I don't think that you can say that our leaders were democratically elected.  I don't know who paid for the Chloe Swarbick posters etc for Auckland Central but no other candidate was visible prior to election.  No other candidate had a comparable billbord or poster etc.  It was inevitable that she was the new Auckland Central elected person.  They didn't even pretend to offer a choice of candidates.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I know they want me to take it personally.  How they choose to treat me.  Have me believe that it's personal against me.  I don't understand why, if that was true, that would make it be okay, somehow.  Is the idea that if it is personal against me then everyone will be motivated to jump on the bandwagon of personally attacking me?  I don't understand why anybody would want for there to be a system or whatever that was all about the personal attacks.  If the Universities and the courts are treating me unfairly..  How much longer before they choose to treat you unfairly?  Why would anybody want to be part of an unfair system where you always have to wonder how long it will be before they choose to target you?  I don't understand the mentality...  The mentality seems to be one in which we parade kim.com so that people who want to live in a place where they can pay the courts pay the courts pay the courts to do anything they like can choose to invest in New Zealand.  Buy themselves citizenship, buy themselves the election if they set their hearts on it.  New Zealand can really be the slave camp detention faciltiy of the world.  Get the criminally inclined to voluntarily choose New Zealand.  Give them victims who have no options.  No choices.  Victims who, according to Chris Hipkins, are not even capable of holding a crayon post-Covid.  No way of documenting their crimes.

                                They are unlawfully drugging people with ketamine and LSD in the name of psychiatry.  They are experimenting on them without consents.  They are doing 'cervical examinations' and likely prostate examinations, too, on patients who have been anesthetised for unrelated procedures.  They are refusing to do surgical checklists.  Those would involve (amongst other things) every person present in the OR to state their name, position, and what they will be doing in the OR.  To ensure that the room isn't populated by building apprentices or whatever.  Rapists.  To ensure that there is an actual surgeon present.  Much of this is documented in the New Zealand Medical Journal hidden from the public behind a pay-wall.

                                I suppose that some people think it's okay, somehow, becuase this is just the Public System where the un-valued people are where we just want them to die rather than paying them because we believe they are replaceable expendible with no talents or skills worth paying them for.  There's a magical wonderful private system populated by caring people who know how to treat the valuable people right.  Sure.  That seems plausible and legitimate -- right?  The Nazi's were singing people off to the death camps by day and loving husbands by night.  Sure they were.  I'm sure they were.  I'm sure that's how they were experienced by their partners and children.  I'm sure that's how they were experienced by their cat.  It isn't psychologically plausible.  That there be no leakage.  That there be a complete lack of humanity when it comes to some...  And there be genuine humanistic feeling actually there when it comes to others.  Not plausible at all.
