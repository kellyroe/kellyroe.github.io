                            <p>I find it so incredibly sad that the politicians are doing the...  Thing that they do...  The 'silly season' of the election.  It's sooooooo competitive everybody taking delight in seeing everyone turn on one person.  The extremes of 'savior' and 'demon'.  People don't get the help they need.  Can't ask for the help they need.  Will be interpreted as a sign of weakness.  Used against them only.  But everybody needs a little help, sometimes.  Something about bringing the people with you.  You can't bring them with you when they are trying to cut you off at the knees.  Delighting in your failures.  Doing everything they can to bring about your failures, in fact, because that is somehow interpreted as a win for them. </p>

                            <p>Likely...  Bullies often truly don't understand or appreciate the impact that their actions are in fact having on others.  Because there isn't a truly independent or neutral or whatever third party with appropriate authority to order them to pause for a minute and consider.  And then get their turn to have a say.  </p>

                            <p>I saw something recently about phrases that our politicians use.  Interesting.  Really.  The speech analysis.  Another thing, though, that wasn't mentioned...  Most people say a lot of 'um' and 'hmm' and so on.  Space fillers, basically.  While they are thinking.  Noice that they  make that means 'I have heard what you have said and I am currently wracking my brain for a sensible answer so what is coming out of my mouth right now is simply designed to block further speech from you because I am working over what you have said already and doing my very very genuine best to come up with a sensible response'.  That kind of 'blocking'.  Most people say a lot of 'um' and 'well' and 'I see'..  Maybe even rephrase the question...  To buy them some thinking time.</p>

                            <p>There is also something that happens with southern vs northern speakers, in the US, I think studies were done on this...  In terms of the rate of speech and the amount of pause.  So, the flow of speech was longer in the south.  So you had more thinking time before the other interpreted you as having given up your conversational turn.  It could be interpreted by non southern speakers as a slowness of thought.  But, it was filled with less fillers like 'yes' and 'mmm' and so on.</p>

                            <p>This is something that I personally find about Andrew Little.  At his best (when he is on form) he has a slow and considered manner (also bassy tones) that people find soothing...  He takes a  breath before he starts to speak and the reporters and so on are.. I don't know...  Hypnotised?  Mesmorised?  I don't know... He is able to take breaths and slow the conversation down.  The quality of the conversation, then, is that much higher.  Because more loops of the frontal cortex are going on before speech output.  From both him and reporters.  Some of his reporting on health, particularly, has seemed honest...  About his state of knowledge and how it may differ from what is going on on the floor..  ANyway..  Sensible conversations that acknowledge some of the complexities...  Because of a slower conversational turn-taking-style.  But that can only happen when people have the confidence to engage in that manner or way without people simply railroading over them and not allowing them any conversational turns at all...  Casting aspersons on them for being slow and stupid...  Etc...</p>

                            <p>(It is a problem when things like 'bassy tones' and so on are what is relevant to political votes...  Sigh...  How much did Harvard pay Jacinda to read the teleprompts, effectively, or read their message?  That always was the thing.. How much would you have to pay for control of a pacific island nation...  NZL being the largest of 'em...  Trophy win.  Not fair.  Like internet being more accessible to people of Dunedin (trophy win!) while the children of Central Providence (2 hours south of MIT) can't even access Khan Academy.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.)</p>

                            <p>Caption:  MIT does walk of shame through central providence</p>

                            <p>(No, that was not my very very best HTML y'all -- just sayin')</p>

                            <p>At some point I remember being taught very very specifically (at Waikato, actually, it was, some class that I went to on how to run tutorials before I ran tutorials).  They said about asking a question -- and then pausing or waiting.  That often times teachers thought that they had given the class time to consider the question so that anybody who wanted to speak could speak -- but they only waited a couple seconds before moving on.  They got us actually practicing asking a question and waiting for 30 seconds.  To see how it felt to wait for 30 seconds.  To ask a question and then wait for 30 seconds.  To give the studnets time to think and deliberate..  Before putting themselves out there, in front of the whole class.  If you wanted to hear considered output rather than reactions (without much thought at all) I mean to say.</p>

                            <p>The NZ environment is very very pressurised with people trying to prove they are not stupid.  Because so much of things seem to be.  Yeah.  Taking a breath...  A considered breath...  Having a mediator or neutral third person present in some of the those pressurised meetings.  To say 'ding ding ding let's all do a 30 seconds pause mindfulness meditation and then you talk for 2 minutes and then you talk for 2 minutes.  We will do converstaional turn-taking after time for pause and reflection'..  Things like that...  Would really help.  We don't want to just keep on fighting and squabbling and throwing people to the dogs?  Do we??  Little help...</p>

                            <p>Nobody is allowed to help.  Often.  It seems.</p>

                            <p>I am thinking, now, about various things that I have sent to various Minsters offices.  Prime Minister.  Deputy.  Leader for Opposition.  Holder of Portfolios.  Etc etc.  Solicitor General.  Attorney General.  Etc etc.  I supopse that the emails did not go to them, directly.  Rather, the emails went to their staff.  Now, their staff are faced with a choice... Do they escalate my email to the person, or not?  Um...  Ah...  Er...  What do the named recipients most want?  Plausible deniability.  I would imagine, or suppose.  They want to be able to say that they didn't know anything about it if it is escalated.  They hope that it is suppressed.  Because they don't know what to do.  They don't know what to do.  And nobody is allowed to help.  Becuase them not knowing is interpreted as a sign of weakness.  So anything they may not know the answer to cannot be put to them, therefore.  It's soooooooooo competitive.  Don't get sick now, ya hear!!!</p>

                            <p>I'm sorry, the children of Central Providence (RI) need the bell:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GiPcP30cFc</p>

                            <p>PS this is what it meeeeeeeans to be ranked number 1 (by dubious authorties -- don't get me wrong) it meeeeeeeans you can handle the criticism and critique.  You are big enough and robust enough to metabolise it and do you f*cking best to show a positive direction forwards..  You f*cking retards (I would NEVER say that to a subordinate or someone with less power than me, not even to an equal).  YOU (F*cking retards, at MIT)  Comprehend.  Aye????</p>

                            <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/493014/nearly-200-university-of-otago-staff-apply-for-redundancy  I am curious to know who (what, when, why?) was denied redundancy.  What does 'redundancy' mean?  I guess it means a financial output of the University that they are relucant to?  I don't know how else to parse that.  Something something about people (so to speak) having worked there (so to speak) since they turned 16, or something, and now they are 75 or something and they can't be made redundant or retire because the redundancy pay is unaffordable?  Please explain (I'd say in 200 words or less but I don't know enough to know what is reaonable.  Do I need a first year essay on the topic or a seond, third, honors, masters, PhD thesis?  I don't know...  Let's start with an abstract?  Up to first year 1,500 words...  Between 250 and 1,500 words.  250 being best.  Go team!!!) What do y'all think, now?  I don't know..  Is there somthing like consensus???  Then y'all would need to start out indepently...  Maybe agreeing on what are teh important differences or issues at stake, at least.  A worthwhile first investigation... </p>

YOu try and limit my accesss to tweets????  Let the hacking wars begin!!!! Game on!!! (How to inspire the twitter-bots to take up hacking for a living hahahhahahaaaaha)  </p>

                            <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/493049/canterbury-regional-council-applies-to-itself-for-consent-to-spray-chemicals Well, obviously the only non-stupid solution is for them to be sprayed first and then if they survive...  Uh..  Well, it's hard to know quite what to do with them at that point.  Ahem, if they survive.  Um... Ur..  *if* they survive??  Uh...  I'm sorry..  Any non-autistic indiviudal in the house??  </p>

                            <p>What do we do about Maria...  Turns out nobody wants to study Medicine in the Monestary after all....  It's soooooooooooooo competitive.......</p>
