                            <p>
                            The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications.  They define a 120 point program of study (e.g., the 120 point MPhil program of study that I applied to be enrolled in) as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a>.  The Universities of New Zealand refuse to accept this, however, and the Courts sided with the Universities.  They believe they are entitled to withhold qualification completions and force re-enrolments in order to collect more momey from the student for re-enrolment and in order to obtain more and more money from the Government or external funders for them keeping the student-slave.  They are not allowing graduate research students to complete their qualifications in timely fashions.  They are forcing continued labor without pay.  They do this with vocational training, also, withholding qualification completions so as to withhold pay.  The New Zealand Government is the major employer.  The New Zealand Government chooses to keep slaves.
                            </p>

                            <p>  
                            The University of Otago (1) refuses to supply applications to some candidates (2) throws away applications from some candidates prior to assessing the application on it's merits (3) collects up disability information prior to selection for purposes of exclusion only (there is no equity pathway for disability).  The High Court of New Zealand has found that there is nothing legally wrong with the public University of Otago choosing to conduct it's business in this manner.  I filed with the Court of Appeal but they refuse to progress my filings because I did not have $7,060 to pay the security for costs amount required by the courts.  The University of Otago chose to require me to bring this to the courts.  The Univesrity of Otago chose not to put things right internally.  The present Univesrsity of Otago Vice Chancellor chooses not to put things right internally.  They believe they are entitlted to select whomever they want for whatever program they want for whatever arbitrary reasons they want.  I post my filings with the Court of Appeal here.  You may want to consider this situation (with the Univesrity of Otago and also with the Courts of New Zealand) very carefully before you decide whether you want to do business with New Zealand:
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  The Justice for the High Court Proceedings was one who seems to have been pulled out of retirement for the occasion.  The government chooses to get judges out of retirement rather than appointing new judges.  I do not know if the judges grand-son or great grand-son was offered a place in a program (or graduation from a program) for his role in the proceedings.  Was offered a reference for his application to Harvard.  Decide for yourself the value of a University of Otago Degree. Otago is a public university of the New Zealand government.  It is not a private university.
                            </p>


                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings on grounds that it had already passed judgment on the filings and would not revisit the issue.  They did not think my filings sufficient to show there had been a grotesque injustice in how they handled my filings.  I post them here so you can judge for yourself.  
                                </p> 

                            <p>
                            The Australian Constition says that New Zealand is a State of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  
                            New Zealand is listed as one of the original states of the federation of Australia.  It states that New Zealand has not been asked to be part of the Commonwealth, and it has not consented, but it is expedient to regard it to be a part of the Commonwealth.  It is declared to be part of the Commonwealth.  There has not been a referendum or whatever needs to happen to alter the constitution to have New Zealand removed from it's status as part of the Constitution of Australia.  As such, I don't see how it is lawful for Australia to require New Zealanders to have Australian Visas.  I don't see how it is lawful for Australia to remove visas and deport New Zealanders anymore than it would be lawful for Australia to remove Australian passport from people from Melborne and refuse to allow them entry to any state outside Victoria.  I don't see how it is lawful for New Zealand to have a separate currency.  The point or purpose of which seems only to be to disguise how low wages are kept, for the majority of New Zealanders.  I don't see how it is lawful for the NZ Government to refuse to hand over Federal tax funding and to refuse to uphold building regulations etc that have been set by the Federal Government of Australia.

                            <p>
                            The Universities of Otago and Auckland are not being fair as to how they are choosing what students to enrol in Medicine.  It wasn't that Dr Leeks (Dr Green etc) happened to slip through a selection criterion or process objectively and fairly applied.  It was that he or they was or were hand-picked or specially chosen for demonstrating all the qualities it is that they value.  I suppose, then, Dr Leeks was transferred to Melborne because that is also what they value over there.  I don't see what else we are supposed to think about that when they harbor him they way they have chosen to.  They are not even trying to be fair.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The Universities and courts have broken the social contract.  The Courts have chosen to set precedent that it will cost upwards of $20,000 to take a case against the University to the High Court, and even then they work to delay and obstruct and prohibit and prevent justice.  
                            </p>

                            <p>This website was set up so that I could put most of my academic work on here (the work I can find).  Because I have not been credited appropriately for my work, over the years.  I have done considerable amounts of graduate research work, particularly, and the people who were paid to help me worked only to undermine and stabotage me, insofar as I can see.
                            </p>

                            <p> I put in an application to start another PhD with the ANU last year (since they haven't acknowledged tht I have done enough for a PhD already) to see what would happen with my application.  When I applied I said I was not really interested in starting over from the beginning again, and was more interested in recieving credit for the work I had done for them already.  What seemed fair?  My application was declined.  They don't seem to be making academic decisions on the basis of academic merits. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Otago has recently claimed that a reason why graduation was cancelled and we didn't see any research students publically credited with having completed their research qualification was because they received threats of violence from a former student.  It does occur to me 'there is no excuse for threats of violence'.  But it also occurs to me that there is no excuse for how Otago has chosen to treat it's students.  What options are there for students or employees or slaves or volunteers when people who have kept them working or studying do not honor terms and when the courts refuse to uphold the law?      
                               </p>

                               <p>
                                The Education and Training Act 2020 and the Education Acts prior to that all stated that domestic adults who had attained the age of 20 years were eligible to  be enrolled in the programme they applied to.  They stated that teenagers (under the age of 20 years) were able to be enrolled by the University only if the University was satisfied that they were able to complete the course.  So, when we hear of a Univerity being satisfied enough that a teenager could complete the course so as to enrol them and take their money and we then hear of the University failing them for their course not only once, but two years in a row, then it really looks like the University has some explaining to do as to how it was that they could not pass the student.  The High Court of Dunedin did not see it that way because the Judges don't seem willing or able to understand justice.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The New Zealand Government has chosen to create and impose incentive structures incentivising slavery.  Preventing and prohibiting the development of training systems and skilled labor.

                                New Zealand does not seem to have a functioning judiciary.

                                There is no 'ethical dilemma'  between 'educational opportunities' on the one hand, and upholding informed consent (treating the patient with dignity), on the other.  This is because you are not teaching students how to perform intimate examinations or surgeries when you are requiring the students perform sexual and physical assaults.  If you don't know the difference between an intimate exam and a physical or sexual assault then you need to stand down.

                                I really don't understand why Jacinda Ardern gets a PhD from Harvard Class of '22.  She didn't attend course-work in 2017 and 2018.  Two years of courses with a cohort of students.  Sitting subject breadth and depth requirements on US law generally and one aspect of it in particular before proceeding to a PhD.  She didn't attend classes with her classmates.  She didn't get to dialogue with the professors or with her peers.  She didn't get to develop and extend her thinking.  She didn't get to write a PhD thesis.  She didn't do any of the work or meet any of the people or engage in any of the readings or the problems or anything. She didn't do any of that at all.  But she gets to graduate with the PhD class of '22.  She didn't even write her own speech.  I mean, I would understand if they wanted to check it and approve it in advance.  But she didn't even know what they would feed her on the teleprompt.  I can't think of anything lacking integrity more than any of this.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I thought she was a University of Waikato Graduate.  So she should have been wearing the gown that she wore to her last graduation.  I don't think she's Maaori -- is she?  On what authority does she wear a Maaori cloak?  How is that part of her graduation gown for Waikato?  How is her wearing anything other than her graduation gown from Waikato appropriate?  I thought she was supposed to be a NZ brand ambassador.  She has the opportunity to wear her Waikato gown proudly.  To insist on writing her own speech with integrity.  What the hell...
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I am just so disappointed.  I don't understand why people would want to send the message out that there is nothing more to a University Degree than 'you have 5 miow miow beans according to what someone hacked into a computer social networking algorithm' or similar.  I don't understand why Jacinda would want the people of New Zealand to think there isn't anything more to the highest level of academic qualification than something like that.  I can't comprehend.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I remember this episode of a television show.  Some wealthy white woman with a film crew alongside.  They wanted to go into a meeting house of some local tribe..  Maybe Paupa New Guniea?  Not sure where.  The women said 'no, it's men only'.  The men said 'no, it's men only'.  It was a cultural thing, apparently.  She asked them how much money in US dollars for her to get to go inside and take the film crew with her and show the entire world (and all it's women) all the women outside the tribe...  The inside of the meeting house.  Money was handed over and they filmed the inside.  I remember feeling sick.  I didn't want to see inside.  There wasn't actually anything to see inside.  But the look on the women's faces in the tribe.  Once they saw the men sell out their culture for a few American dollars.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I got that same feeling watching Jacinda on stage at Harvard.  Reading the telepromps.  With a Maaori robe.  While they applaud her for drinking water.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                It wasn't quite the Hitler projection that there was in "The Wave".  But it was pretty darned close.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I don't really understand.  I can't comprehend how or why she thought it appropriate for her to accept such a Degree.  Particularly when there are problems, back home, with the Tertiary Education System in NZ (the public one) taking people's money and not giving them the degree for the work they did on their qualification.  The complete lack of integrity...
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                All those kids killed, in Texas.  And one young man, who had only recently turned 18.  His brain was still growing.  They had all these things in place.  Security people with guns.  But they didn't have a school counsellor or helping professionals in place so that kids who are feeling bullied or ostracised or whatever can get help that they need so that they can graduate with their cohort.  Politics, huh.  They won't train and employ professionals so that people who are feeling bullied or ostracised or whatever can have the help they need to be productive.  It's sooooo compeitive.  There will be no help.  It's so sad.  All the squabbling about changing laws when we don't even uphold the laws that we've got.  So f*cking sad.
                                </p>
