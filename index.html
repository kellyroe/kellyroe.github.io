                        <div class="container">

                            <p>What is 'frictional unemployment' these days, in New Zealand?  For how many months can a person expect or anticipate to be applying for employment, before something suitable comes through?  I'm wondering out loud,  because I am applying...  I have  been applying.  I have been sending through (1)  applications.  I have also been sending through (2)...  I will call (2) 'statements of concerns' or reservations that I have about working within certain or particular organisations.  For example, I have held off applying for employment to do with visa processing because of what has been in the news about how employees are feeling forced to work under pressure to approve visas where people are set up for exploitation.  Now, I would have problems or issues with doing this.  Many people have problems or issues with doing this.  Many other people will do it anyway, though, and not speak up or out about it.  I don't know.  Maybe they have small children at home and they can tell themselves they are worried the government will target their small children for exclusion and abuses if they don't keep their heads down...  I don't know...  What lengths will they go to force compliance or strongly induce compliance.  Whether real or just propagating the idea that these things might or could happen.  Fearmongering etc.  So...  I can follow the proper process on raising issues with superiors.  Then they delay for the maximum time and it goes to their superiors.  So it takes however many years to work it's way up the food-chain and to international community.  Delay delay delay until they've been pronounced dead by the only people they'd pay to pronounce death.  Is that the idea?  For the good of...  Uh, for the good of, uh, for the good of who, again?</p>

                            <p>My full-time GPA for undergraduate and honors years was 8.6.  That is part way between an A and an A+.  That was the prounouncement on the quality of my academic work.  I then wrote a first masters thesis, a doctoral thesis, a second masters thesis.  Now, people confuse not liking what I have to say with the fact that I've done it or said it or whatever.  The 'Universities' think that by employing or payrolling people who say 'I'm off on holiday now, see ya!' instead of supervising that they never need graduate their students.  But the students have been put to work in the name of their training programme.  And instead of their payroll they were supposed to be given a qualification after the bums were on the seats for whatever length of time.  I handed work over...  Nobody called me in for a meeting to say that they had any concerns about my progress.  Nobody said I hadn't done enough work for the qualifiations.  People joke about how I'd done the work for the qualifications before I'd even been enrolled in the programme!  I'd done a doctoral thesis of work for my first masters credit!  They won't pay the workers.  They won't credit the people who have done the work!  But I can show people that the work was done.  So they simply pronounce and proclaim to the world that they are lacking in honesty and integrity and they are not even trying to be fair, at all.  Where is my money?  Hey...  Where is the money?  Where did you put it?  Where did it go?  Where is my job title!  THat's what I get now.  Right?  So that I can be paid and paid and paid to tell the next generation 'now is your turn to slave and slave and slave doing all the work in the name of your training programme while I say 'I'm off on holiday now!  See ya!''.</p>

                            <p>The 'imposter syndrome' thing is real.  It goes like this.  (1)  They throw away any applications they get from the target population.  Let's say African-American, as an example.  (2)  They find a couple weak applications and put those through 'in the name of equity'.  (3)  Now you have 'equity candidates' (at Harvard, or similar) who can say 'The only reason why I'm at Harvard is because of their affirmative action programme'.  They can rightly say they wouldn't be there if it wasn't because of it.  THe only reason they were picked out to be there was because of it.  They also say that they feel that they are imposters.  That they don't belong there.  That they shouldn't be there.  That they would never have been picked to do it if their application had been processed blind to what race they were.  But the real point or purpose or whatever of the equity policy was to prevent and prohibit those with capacity or capability those with most merit from doing the programme.  SO that they could expedite selection for people who would..  Make it more likely for people to feel racist thoughts against people of the race.  Now, I'm not saying anything that hasn't been said before.  It's been said before that some people in the US will say they don't want to see a black doctor because they believe that the black doctors were all picked for training and graduation precisely because they were not as competent as the white doctors.  They never would have picked the black ones if they weren't weaker candidates.  That's the way the racism goes.</p>

                            <p>So we end up with these people in positions who feel (rightly) that they were only appointed for being incompetent.  I guess they are more likely to keep their heads down.  Is the value.  They only get picked to do the job because they...  I don't know...  Can't teach people what they don't know, or something.  So we don't have to worry about them teaching the next generation.  They will keep it oppressed.  Prevention and prohibition of flourishing and thriving and so on.  For the good of..  Uh..  The good of..  For the good of, whom, again?</p>

                            <p>The 'calibre' of some applicants.  Sure.  The 'calibre' of people who (1) Won't raise issues with superior officers who (2)  Won't go over their heads if things are not dealt with appropriately who (3)  won't start up their own website to publish their version of events.  Are they even trying to be fair, at all?  </p>

                            <p>Apparently qualifications are just supposed to be about doing 'enough' for a paycheque.  Well, then, where is my pay cheque?  Either I've done enough or I've done too much.  I'm either too tall or too short.  I'm too thick I'm too thin I'm too smart I'm not smart enough.  I'm sick and f*cking tired of the bullsh*t made up excuses where you hire imposters into position for all the qualities that you value, one can only suppose.  The prevention and prohibition of development programme.  The 'we can't see anything wrong we won't see anything wrong there is nothing wrong we insist on continuing on with all the atrocities we can get away with what are you going to do about it you and whose army'? manner or mode or style of governance.  There's nothing there...  PROCESS THE APPLICATION.  HURRY UP.  It's not rocket science ffs...  Not brain science.  It's really not that f*cking hard.</p>

                            <p>The statutory laws of NZ state what the statutory function of the NZVCC is supposed to be.  Chris Whelan (in his position as CE) is supposed to exemplify that function.  The statutory law is clear about the function being to uphold complaints of wrong-doing in accordance with international requirements on protecting whistleblowers.  To this end Chris Whelan has led an organisation (since about 2014 when he was appointed to office) that acknowledge receipt of NO COMPLAINTS OF WRONG-DOING.  He tells the judge (pulled out of retirement to not see anything wrong - the embodiment of injustice) that they get more complaints every year..  More and more and more.  But NONE of them are classified by his office as complaints of 'wrong-doing'.  They have written policy documents on what constitutes 'wrong-doing' but they refuse to acknowledge that any of the complaints they have received count as complaints of 'wrong-doing'.  Even when the complaints are wrong-doing according to their policy.  Apparently Ms Roe is the only person who has ever successfully lodged, with the NZVCC, a complaint of serious wrong-doing against one of the 'universities' of NZL.  The High Court Judge (not appointed by proper process) declared it to be so!  The High Court Judge said that instead of following the statutory law on processing the complaint (getting the evidence of wrong-doing to the police so they can prosecute the 'university') Chris Whelan should change his policy so that no complaint of wrong-doing can be acknowledged as having been received.  For the good of whom, again?  Says the +++65 year old injustice pulled from retirement for precisely the occasion...   </p>

                            <p>The Supreme Court acknowledges this is not in the public's interest.</p>

                            <p>What 'universities'?  What 'judiciary'?</p>

                            <p>Vice Chancellor of the New Zealand Vice Chancellor's Committee.  I could do the job better than Chris Whelan.  He has led an organisation where they have refused to acknowledge that they have received any complaints of wrong-doing when the organisation had one job to do.  That job pays a couple hundred thousand dollars per year.  I would have done it with pay restraint, even.  You can see it's not about the money, hey.  Not about the money, at all.  Recently the 'University' of Waikato advertised for a Vice Chancellor of Research.  Who do you think would do a better job of leading an organisation with demonstrated research output?  Quigley, or me?  I self-published my own research.  Quigley wouldn't acknowledge my research output.  There is more research output with me.  He had one job to do.  The Statutory law says Universities primary function is research.  What does Quigley do to support his academics research output?  The prevention and prohibition of research output.  The keeping of slaves.  The supression of complaints.  How much did Quigley get paid?  Were there really no other applicants for their paid employment positions?  They were the only game in town, we are supposed to believe?  All the other applications were thrown away by the only people you'd acknowledge on your HR?  Seriously?  No other game in town!  For the good of..  For the good of..  For the good of whom again?</p>

                            <p>What University?  What Judiciary?  What developed nation?  What a f*cking joke!</p>

                            <p>Yes.  I applied to be Vice Chancellor of Research with the University of Waikato.  But why would they process an application for employment when they can't even / they won't even process an application for anything else?  They can't even / won't even process an application for enrolment.  They won't do it.  They will hire from overseas rather than hiring one of their own.  There's nothing there.  Quite by design.  One can only suppose.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  They don't want a medical school.  They want more and more and more money for re re re re re re re enrolments.  Who will teach in their medical school?  See ya!  I'm off on holiday now!  Just get in there!  Have a go!  Then get out and we'll replace you with new students.  That's the plan for 'healthcare'?  Which means to say there is no plan.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.   Nothing nothing nothing at all.  Quite by design.</p>

                            <p> https://www.seek.co.nz/job/69999879?type=standout#sol=26437d7ee5d9aa8d6a73355485697945bd28bd43  Now the government wants 'managers' (with no academic background in medicine or research) to run the clinical trials and medical experiments to be conducted on 'target populations' (i.e., the gamma babies) in the naaaaaame of 'equity'!  Everybody knows that that's the job of government.  To run medical experiments on people who have no right to protest, object, or not be volunteered.  The government is sooooo busy doing things it's not supposed to be doing (things beyond it's scope) that it doesn't have any time or money or resources left to do any of the things that they're supposed to do.  I guess it makes sense that Ayesha and Shane and Ashley would be graduated from Medicine.  They have how many  hours of clinical practice  between them?  That was why they were graduated -- right?  Because they never would be paid to work that job.  What univesrity?  But then, what government?  What election?  What developed nation?  There really doesn't seem to be anything there...  Can't even / won't even process applications to enrol.  Hurry hurry hurry give everything to the highest bidders from overseas so you can lure them here under false pretenses.  How much does it cost for a South African born person who trained in England to buy for themselves 'New Zealander of the year'?  She was the marketing con-munications face of Medicine -- wasn't she?  So...  Do her 'students' who work in her 'laboratories' with infectious organisms have PPE, yet?  What education system?   Not even trying to be fair.  There's nothing here.  Not even trying to be fair. </p>

                            <p>The thing with the face masks was opening the cupboards -- and seeing the cupboards were bare.  Why is it they are wanting to feed LSD and ketamine and so on to people taken into hospital detention?  Is it because the actual medicines were stolen and sold on the black market etc?  How do you think the doctors and nurses and pharmacists will make their money if you don't pay them?  How is it supposed to go, do you think?  With this wonderful plan that we have to never see evidence of any corruption.  To never perceive corruption.  To never acknowledge receipt of any complaints.  To swiftly cull the people with any concerns.  To teach people that if they speak up then things will become worse, only.  Only that's not true.  When you speak up and see things become worse  you know it isn't that things are becoming worse.  It's just that the cover on how bad things are is being lifted up.  So that how bad things are is made manifest.  Are we trying to make things better?  Really?  Was it 'try' that led to judges being reappointed from retirement (not by proper process)?  Is that what 'trying to be fair' looks like?  Was it 'try' that resulted in the Supreme Court of NZ proclaiming to the world that they didn't know what 'public interest' was...  Else the word salad that has them pronounce 'what was done was not in the public's interest, at all, therefore it is not in the public interest to ensure that it continue on.  We won't put a stop to the NZ 'universities' refusing to process applications to enrol, refusing to acknowledge progression through training, refusing to get theses to externals, refusing to allow externals to sign off on qualifiation completions.  It is not in the public interest that Chris Whelan refuses to acknowledge receipt of any complaints of wrongdoing (while admitting he has more complaints than he can process).  None of this is in the public's interest.  That Chris Whelan throws the complaints of wrongdoing away.  All this is not in the public's interest.  The High Courts pronounce 'Carry on!  The public must pay for the crimes of the government!  The public must pay!  The public must pay!' .  They got that right - it is not in the public interest, at all.  The health system and education system and so on are not in the public interest.  They are not social services.  They are the prevention and prohibition of social services.  They are the underminig of public interest.  They have set about making as many gamma babies who will shut up about the crimes of the over-lords..  The 'we happy few'.  The pedophiles and rapists and bullies and murderers.  The likes of Dr Leeks.  Trafficked about the world as 'most desirable' for purposes, one can only suppose, of population control.  How is that working out?  </p>

                            <p>How are the  natural disasters working out?  Enough funds being freed up to go to the over-lords for their new-builds?  That's the function of goverment, right?  To declare war against the people.  Weather bomb here, weather bomb there.  Targeted experiment there.  Involuntary detention here...  Don't get sick now, ya hear!  Is the world better or worse for you having been in it...  I don't know.  How many will turn up to your funeral to check for themselves..  Is he really dead?  Really?  Really really really?  Party party party time.  </p>

                            <p>What health system?  What education system?  What judiciary?  What parliament?  Apparently all that matters is (1)  Where the money goes.  Where the money is.  Who has the money.  Who is kept deprived.  Also (2)  Who gets to do what, now.  Who gets to bully and abuse and rape and torture and so on while the others enjoy that, as sport, one can only suppose, and work real hard to figure the next one to take their place once they've been deposed.  Whack a mole.  It isn't like what they are doing is any different from what anybody else would be doing.  Right?  It's what 'being a winner' is, or looks like.  The only game in town.  Everything it is that we value.  The only thing of any value.  If you think otherwise then you are a loser, therefore.  How you like being appointed as victim for their ongoing crimes?  We can call it a 'social experiment' in how there isn't anything here and there never will be.  No hint of 'try'.  Just take everything you can because you can for as long as you can until you die.  Meaning of life, right there.  They would have things no other way.</p>


                <p> Now that Justice Toogood (pulled out of his retirement for the occasion)  has found that there isn't anything wrong with the Universities of NZ saying that students have  been enrolled in programmes of study that they never even applied to be enrolled in...  The Government wants to record that how many have  been enrolled in MBChB Degree programme?  That's how much debt against their names?  For a programme of study where..  How many was it, Harlene?  1/3rd of the class had graduation withheld -- because the University said that they refused to accept that they had  been signed off as having completed their internship requirement.  Even though it had  been signed off  by international community.  The University of Otago refused to graduate them.  Not exactly a University, hey.  Prison.  Slave.  Detention camp.
                </p>

                <p>Let's all be enrolled in a 'Degree' programme where we can play doctors and nurses and do anything anything anything everything everything Dr Leeks 2.0 says when he says because he says...  Else...  What?  Be imprisoned in the name of 'psychiatry' and fed horse tranquiliser and surgical anasthetics else pronounced 'suicided' all 'voluntary-like'?  What health system?  They can't even / won't even process an application to enroll on the basis of it's academic merits.  They can't even / won't even acknowledge progression through training programmes.  They can't even / won't even graduate people who have done the work that was required for their qualifications.  They won't get the work to external examiners.  They won't allow it to be examined on it's academic merits.  They won't allow international community to sign off.  There's nothing there.  They just won't do it.  Taken over by psychopaths.  Right, Sterelny?  Selfish, selfish, selfish, they're all so f*cking selfish.  Why would anybody help anybody?  What a joke.  It's soooooo competitive!  It's sooooo competitive!  Only over their dead bodies,  hey.  What health system?  What judiciary?  There's nothing there. </p>

                <p>They are being clearer, now, about how it's just a front for the control of people they regard to be sub-persons.  Not person centred, hey.  All about the prevention and prohibition of persons.  Sign the subs up for observational studies or clinical trials or both where at least some are kept in conditions known to be inhumane.  Those who run the studies we can call 'medical doctors' or 'clinical nurses' or..  It really doesn't matter what you call them.  The less education people have, the younger they are when you get them doing anything anything anything everything everything you say when you say because you say...  Pushing and pulling the levers on demand.  Everyone in Australasia would follow the instructions to electrocute someone to death if they thought they would get away with it.  Right?  That's the whole point of these lands?  Don't get sick, now, Chris.  And the only alternative.  Chris.  Right.  The only people who were accepted as candidates for the there is no alternative.  What democracy?  It doesn't seem to matter what any of the laws are because the judiciary refuses to uphold the laws.  Not even trying to be rule by law.  And so, why, then, would international community be constrained by or ruled by international laws when it comes to how they deal or interact with the leaders of New Zealand?  I mean, seriously...</p>

                <p>The great marketing campaign is how kim.com was not extradited to stand trial.  Not even the US.  Come to NZ all the people who might be subject to criminal proceedings overseas.  We have declared ourselves to be a nation where those awaiting trial can come to all voluntary-like.  An entire nation kept in detention.  Shortland Street the media propaganda of how to pass yourself off as a doctor or a nurse or...  Yet another propaganda campaign.  The government wanting to hire people to manage social media accounts for the government.  Don't forget to write a bot to up-vote the politicans everybody!  The government paying people to create dis-information.  Wouldn't pass the bot tests if it tried.  There's nobody home.  Nothing there, hey.  Come to NZ all you graduates of Harvard!  Nobody was ever prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus in NZ even when abortion was in the crimes act as a criminal offence.  And now it's taken out so NZ can be the destination of choice for all those 'knock-out' baby (gene) studies.  All the experiments or observational studies on the long term effects of oxygen deprivation etc for the infants hauled out early (steroids will surely help) and kept in Fisher and Paykal incubators to  be experimented upon.  'I'm soooo glad I'm a gamma baby I don't have to work half as hard as Ashley'.  Made Professor, was he?  Without a PhD or MD.  Without having done the academic work for one.  Without a reserarch thesis.  Without any publications.  Makes sense.  That someone who hadn't done the work would be appointed into position while those who have done the work have their qualifications withheld.  Only treat the involuntary non-voluntary non-consenting.  They have been volunteered.  They have been consented.  What part of it is hard to understand?</p>
