    <p>To be fair...  If I was High Court Judge I probably would have found...  That the case was (in precedent) most relevantly similar to the Jehovah's Witness case.  So relevant precedent was in favor of taking custody from the parents.  I mean to say that I think (for whatever that is worth) that the High Court decision was probably the right one for that court to make and for those reasons.  I wonder if they will appeal the decision.  I hope that they do.  The Court of Appeal is less constrained by precedent.  I'm not entirely sure how that goes...  I think the Court of Appeal is allowed to (it's role is to) consider issues more widely than focusing on precedent...  I don't know.  The Bill of Rights does say that we have the right to refuse Medical Treatment.  But it is one thing to refuse Medical Treatment for oneself and a different thing entirely to refuse Medical Treatment on behalf of someone else when we simply don't know what the would want for himself later in life..  If he got to look back and say what he wished to have happened...  Don't know.  Nobody knows.  It must be really hard to stand by, sometimes, and see people make what we believe to be bad, wrong, harmful decisions when it comes to their kids and the like.  But the Government can't step in and take custody of all the kids...  I mean to say precedent is that that situation never does turn out well...  I don't nkow about the blood service thing.  More tailored treatment...  I don't know why it would be an unreasonable burden on NZ's blood service to be handling it's own blood products instead of shipping things to and fro from Australia.  But then, given the state of our  health service (can't even process an applicaton to enrol or keep accurate or secure health records) etc etc...  I do think it is concerning that, well, the Court of Appeal really should consider that it is a polarising decision that will make it a whole lot less likely that quite a few people will present their kids for healthcare, now.  People will hide away from the health system, most likely, because they don't want the Government taking control of their kids.  Sit in their rockers on their porches oiling their rifles or something, in case the government shows up.  Get off my property.  One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand.  Boom.  Still.  I suppose it is a good thing when the demand on health services is reduced?  Apparently there is no shortage of people being ramped etc etc.  Just so long as all the beds are filled and they get x amount of dollars for filling each bed every night...  I suppose that's how the hostage funding works...  Prove me wrong?  One consent form for every patient...  Or exactly how many are being held involuntarily in State care?  Under the care of a physician, you say?  Lisence and registration number, please...
