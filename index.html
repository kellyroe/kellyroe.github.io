 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->

                            <article>

                                <p>Alright, so here's the story.  I am waiting on two things: </p> 

                                <p>(1)  The Australian National University.  They are locating my student records and saying something about why I left the ANU without recieving credit for a PhD. 
                                </p> 

                                <p>(2)  The social security tribunal of New Zealand.  The courts have set more than $20,000 security for costs otherwise my proceedings are, they say, forced to have been abandoned.  Forced to be aborted, if you will.  The registrar's say that my cases are not public interest cases and everything is all very particular or personal against me.
                                </p>


                            <p>
                            The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications.  They define a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  
                            <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a> Whereas the High Court Judge thought that the University of Waikato was entitled to refuse to get my work to external examiners because I submitted it 'too early'.  Waikato said I needed to work for 12 months (at least) before submitting a 120 point thesis for up to 3 months of external examination.  Apparently that's normal practice for all the students -- but it's not a matter of public interest, it's all very personal against me.
                            </p>

                            <p>Here is how much the Inland Revenue says I owe the New Zealand Government for my 'Education' and 'Training' that are no longer acknowledged because New Zealand qualifications expire 5 years post-graduation (well, not the Judges law degrees, apparently, but my qualifications have expired): 
  
                            <a href="judicial-review/ird-shot.pdf" target="_self"> $104,663.</a>

                            They have not provided a break-down of what courses they recorded me as having been enrolled in, in what year.  I have transcripts for some years that I will upload.  They acknowledge that I have completed BA(hons) and an MA (I can't tell whether they invoiced 1 year or 2 years or more of fees total for the MA - it looks to me from my transcript that they may have double-billed).  They refuse to acknowledge that I have completed anything since then.  They keep invoicing my student loan -- for courses that I never applied to be enrolled in (changing enrolment dates for more billings for them which make me look like I'm slow).  They take my research work, particularly, and give it to third parties without crediting me (or paying me).   
                            </p>

                            <p> We don't have a health system.  We don't have an education and training system.  There's nothing here.  It's a detention camp is all.  There's nothing here.  The courts don't / won't / can't function.  There's nothing here.  Or there's two worlds or two realms, or something, and I'm shut out.  Not Miss popular.  No PhD for me.  That's clearly what it's about.  Honorary because we like you else nothing at all.
                            </p>

                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  They aren't progressing the filings. They are refusing to supply applications, refusing to process applications on their academic merits.  Apparently it isn't a matter of public interest how they pick and choose people to pass themsleves off as 'doctors' in our hospitals.
                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  Demanding me to pay more and more and more money to the courts else they force all my cases aborted, or abandoned.  
                                </p> 

                            <p>
                            It seems to me that the Australian Constition explicitly states that New Zealand is regarded, by them, to be a State of the Federation of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  Australia refuses to honor it's own Constitution.  New Zealand seems to function as a detention camp of Australia only.  That is how the NZ Government chooses to keep the people of New Zealand.
                            </p>

                            <p>Here are  <a href="judicial-review/sup-court-waikato.pdf" target="_self"> My Filings </a>to the Supreme Court regarding the University of Waikato    
                            </p>

                            <p>The Social Security Appeal Authority  <a href="judicial-review/ssaa.pdf" target="_self"> Intention to schedule a phone call sometime after July 4. </a></p>

                            <p>So the state of the scam is 1/3rd of the nurses aren't graduated because they refuse to sign off that they have completed their internship.  They are 'working' 40 hour weeks while paying the University for their student fees, not being paid by the hospital.  They get them to re-enrol and re-enrol and re-enrol and keep paying keep paying never stop paying the University.  That is how we 'staff' the hospital.  With unpaid slaves.  Who pay the University.  How long can they get away with that?  I guess at some point someone will blow up the hospital.  That seems to be what they are going for, here.  Quite the experiment.  Quite the primate research study.  They say they won't give them their qualifications -- because then they would choose to leave for overseas (Australia, say) where they would actually be paid to work.  They don't want them leaving, and they don't want to pay them, so they decide they are entitled to keep them, slaving, as slaves.  If they don't like it, well, f*ck off and die, then.  Can always replace you with a new cohort of students.  It's sooooooooo competitive.  The students will do anything anything anything for their degree.  And it's all very normal completely normal and standard and it just happens to everyone like this.  It's just the way that it is.  because of COvid.  You know...
