                            <p>HOW TO CREATE A TERRORIST</p>

                            <p>What you do is you keep false records against them.  You keep false health records, false education records, false court records.  False records, false records, false records.  You refuse to correct the false records.  You also refuse to do any of the things that you are supposed to do when it comes to keeping accurate records.  When it comes to collecting and keeping and processing data properly.  You don't do any of the things that you are supposed to do, at all.  Then, what are the people going to do about it?  Them and whose army?  Hahahahhahahaha.  The NZ government is SO CLEVER trying to breed "CyberTerrorists" they will call them.  By keeping false records saying that people are mentally ill psychopathic criminals.  When it's time to pay them, conveniently enough.  When it's time for them to be deported or sent off to the death camps.</p>

                            <p>I was able to get this site up and running because HTML is a permissive language.  I needed to self-publish my work because I was not getting appropriate credit for it from various Universities.  Supervisors and University Administrators were not getting my work out to external examiners -- because they get more and more and more and more money for claiming to have students re re re re re re enrolled.  Apparently it is soooooo competitive.  The people collecting up all the research funding don't want anybody else applying for research funding.  They need to be the only game in town.   </p>

                            <p>You can see from this website that I wrote a MA for University of Waikato,  a PhD for the Australian National University, a MPhil for the University of Waikato (in that order).  Why enrol in an MPhil programme after writing a PhD?  The University of Auckland told me I needed to complete a new qualification from a NZ Univesrity for entry to MBChB (Medicine) and I wanted to train to do Psychiatry so that Dr Leeks wouldn't be the only game in town.  The University of Auckland is not processing applications to enrol according to their published criterion or (more problematically) they are not processing applications to enrol according to the Education and Training Act.  Particularly, they are throwing away applications from domestic adults (who are eligible by statute) wrongly claiming they are 'ineligible to have applied' while preferentially enrolling teenagers to record levels of university debt against their name while they are eligible (by statute) to be recieving a free secondary school education up until the time they turn 20 years of age. </p>

                            <p>I was instructed by Neil Quigley (the Vice Chancellor of the University of Waikato) to take the University to court if I had a problem with the University of Waikato having enrolled me in a programme of study that I never applied to be enrolled in (MPhil for 2019 after I wrote them a 120 point MPhil in 2018, already) and recorded levels of debt against my name for them having done that with the IRD.  The Judiciary then chose to get Justice Toogood out of retirement (not proper process for appointing Judges) to proclaim that he can't see anything wrong with NZ Universities enrolling studnets in programmes they never applied to, in NZ Universities refusing to get studnets theses out to external examiners, and NZ Universities keeping false student records recording that studnets have failed to meet requirements for qualifications when the external examiners have kept the students intellectual property signifying that it was to be accepted in hard-copy by the university.  The Calendar Regulations state that in order for the University to require re-enrolment the externals need to return the thesis to the student.  Else, any substantive changes to it are to be made within 10 weeks only.  NZ Universities are not functioning as Universities at all, they are functioning as slave, prison, or detention camps.  Not willing or able to process applications to enrol, progressions through training, completions of training.  There's nothing there.</p>

                            <p>New Zealand doesn't have an education and training system.  New Zealand doesn't have doctors or lawyers or...  New Zealand appoints people (who haven't done the work for those qualifications) from nepotism (often) else takes people struck off various registers to practice overseas either because of atrocities or becuase they would have to be investigated for atrocities if they weren't willing to flee to New Zealand.  New Zealand will not pay it's workers.  Why would you pay workers when you can record that people are kept enrolled as prisoners of NZ Universities and put them to work in the  name of "internship".  Students can do the work for no pay and no credit until they are untimely deathed by the only people the NZ government will put on payroll as "medical doctor" etc.  There's really nothing here.</p>

                            <p>I don't know why NZ would do any of the things that it is supposed to do when it comes to securely keeping data like how much money people owe the government (the false IRD records recording re enrolments), how many weeks or months or years people are kept unlawfully detained  by the "health system" (kept in conditions the UN would likely regard torture in thte "hospitals).  False records of education.  False transcripts.  Not able to keep accurate records of enrolment, progression through training.  Not able to accurately record or calculate full time GPA.  Not able to give qualifications to all and only those who have met requirements for them.  I don't know how they manage payrolls.  Doesn't seem likely that they do.  I don't know how anyone can do any kind of business at all in a place where the courts don't seem willing and or able to have proper Judges (appointed by proper process).  Don't seem capable of outputting a judgment at all (waiting more than 6 months for the social security tribunal to deliver judgment on whether justice is an essential need in NZ, or not).  There's really nobody home, so far as I can see.  No "try".  I don't see the government trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                            <p>I have been doing Codecademy courses.  I am presently working to complete the Full Stack Engineer Career Pathway.  I want to be able to have a nicely coded website where I can showcase my work since University people refuse to acknowledge me so that they can be the only game in town.  I can also document the corruption within Australasia.  It is in the Australian Constitution that NZ is a state of Australia (regardless of whether it consents to this, on grounds of expediency).  There is a process for changing the constitution (vote) and that process has not been followed to have NZ removed as a State.  Australia refuses to honor it's own constitution.  Refuses to process NZ citizens for Education and Training in Australia.  Refuses to get NZ studnets work out for external examination.  Makes NZ students work 2x or 3x or more the standard time for qualifications with no intention of ever signing off on completion of their qualifications.  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camps.  Not even trying to be fair. </p>

                            <p>I am pretty sure that government agencies etc don't do any of the things that they are supposed to do when it comes to how they collect, keep, store, transmit data.  Keeping false records.  Etc.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  Close the "hostpial" down.  They can't / won't admit all and only the people who consent to be there for Medical Treatment's they have consented to.  Close the "universities" down.  They won't enrol only the people who applied to the programme they want to enrol them in.  They won't get their work out to external examiners.  Won't pay anybody to work that job.  Why pay someone when you can get a student slave to do it for no pay?  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  Look at the non-existent research output of all these people on Government payroll as "university academics".  Their primary function is supposed to be research.  They don't have research outputs.  What do they do?  5,000 words per year?  Nobody home.  Nothing there.

                            <p>Courses I've completed:  Learn HTML, Introduction to Cybersecurity, Code Foundations, Learn how to Code, Learn the Command Line</p>

                            <p>Hurry up, New Zealand.  Every other nation has ALREADY paid out more than you intend to as initial payment to victims of abuse in state care.  HURRY UP NEW ZEALAND.  The thing is that New Zealand doesn't  beleive that it is wrong to abuse people in State Care.  Dr Leeks was a national hero.  Everything it is that is valued, in NZ, as a Medical Professional.  He pimped the children out to the highest bidder, I suppose, which meant that the Government didn't need to pay him.  I guess that's how it works.  You don't need to pay Doctors.  They can collect money for saying their hostages will die unless they kickstart a gofund me for however much money the Doctor needs else the patient will die.  I'll make a photoshop programme, at some point, so that people can get busy coloring in bits red so they can tell the patient that they will need to destroy or remove or take out or fix or alter the bit they colored in red.  So better hand over however many tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars else the hostage will likely die.  See how many people you can get on board with the idea that the person will die.  Then when they die no inquiry needs to be made at all.  Really high-tec.  Science led.  Yeah, right.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                            <p>Jacinda Ardern -- the current elected Prime Minister of New Zealand...  Has apparently been enrolled in some certificiate programme at Harvard?  We are supposed to believe she's been taken into custody, or something, while she does a leadership programme, or similar.  Party party party with the Prime Minister of Norway?  Is that what we are supposed to believe?  Apparently it's totally normal for the elected leader to decide all voluntary-like to stand down from their position and walk away to be enrolled in programmes of study that they likely never even applied to be enrolled in.  Don't forget to pay, Jacinda.  Don't forget to pay and pay and pay the University for re re re re re re enrolment.  A 6 month certificate programme, is it?</p>

                            <p>Otago University wants to say it's been under-paid by the government.  But what enrolment periods are they claiming for their graduate research students?  How many theses get sent out to external examiners in a timely fashion so that studnets can complete their 1 EFT, 2 EFT, 3 EFT, or 4 EFT programmes of study within the enrolment period?  Any of them?  What University?  The University doesn't get enough money for all the false enrolment records they keep?  How much does the Vice Chancellor take, again?  More than half a million dollars each and every year, was it?  Wah wah wah we don't have enough money!  Apparently Lord Ashley Bloomfield (a title and honor given to him for declaring lockdown in a manner that was technically, strictly, actually, unlawful) is now a Professor at Auckland Univesrity!  He never applied to do PhD, never wrote a PhD.  He doesn't have a research output.  He's now earning how much money each and every year to pass himself off as Professor?  Corruption.  Corruption.  Corruption.  NOt even trying to be fair.  What Univesrity?  There's nothing here. </p>

                            <p>Justice Toogood doesn't see anything wrong with the Univesrity of Canterbury collecting up money for having Mason Pendrous enrolled (meanwhile he's been dead for one month).  Justice Toogood doesn't see anything wrong.  Justice Toogood doesn't think the University can pinpoint his time of death on the basis of when he stopped utilising his Univesrity internet access.  Doesn't think that they can identify the last person seen leaving his room on the basis of the cloud Univesrity security camera footage from the student residential hall.  Corruption.  Corruption.  Corruption.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                            <p>When the Australian Constitution says that NZ is a State of the Federation of Australia what it means in Australian English is that New Zealanders must live in Australia for 4 years before paying and paying and paying and paying to sit a test where it is announced to them that they don't speak Australian English well enough for citizenship.  Everything it is that Australia values (prison, slave, detention camps up and down the land).  The Australian National University not properly processing applications to enrol (falsely accuses me of an incomplete application with no writing samples when I supplied a link to my writing page which included a 100,000+ word PhD thesis that I had written for them already, and they had 3 writing samples for me on file already from my previous applications to summer research scholarship and PhD).  Australian Universities not getting work out to external examiners.  They wont' get the work out to externals.  Apparently it's soooooo competitive for research funding.  We go to Univesrity to have morning and afternoon tea.  To eat our lunch.  We certainly don't bother going for things like supervision.  What supervision?  Where is the evidence that my supervisor provided supervision to me?  What supervision?  Oh well..  If you are too lazy or stupid or whatever to do the job for which you are paid get out of the f*cking way, then.  I supplied you with a 100,000+ word thesis and since you aren't going to help at all just get it to externals.  Maybe send them a note saying why you refused to do the job for which you are paid.  F*cking psyhchopaths, I tell you what.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                            <p>Chris Whelan (in his position as VC of the NZVCC) has refused to process a single application of wrongdoing that has been lodged against NZ Universities.  He says he gets too many to process.  He says they are all personal.  Very very personal problems between people on payroll to supervise studnets and students.  The studnets problems are all very very personal and particular to the students.  They also want to say that the way Waikato University treated me (refusing to allow me to complete 1 year of research within 1 year by refusing to get my work out to externals) is no different from what any other "university" of New Zealand would be doing.  It wouldn't be fair to other studnets if I was allowed to complete 1 year of work in 1 year when they are re re re re re re re re enrolled for decades...  It wouldnt' be fair if a person over the age of 40 was ever given credit for having done enough for PhD when they had written 1 50,000 word thesis and 1 100,000 word thesis and another 50,000 thesis and then again another 50,000 word thesis.  A co-authored book chapter.  Years and f*cking years and f*cking years of research work.  More research work than Lord f*cking Ashlely Bloomfield.  Wah wah wah we don't have any money!  Ashley needs a payrise!  Corruption.  Corruption.  Corruption.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  New Zealand does not have an education and training system, at all.  There's nothing here.  No skilled output.  It's soooooo competitive.  Gnawing each others arms off.  There's nothing here.  </p>
