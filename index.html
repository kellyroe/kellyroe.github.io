            <p>All these others, who the ANU says they graduated.  All these others, who went into permanent paid employment positions post-doctoral positions.  All these others...  The entire time that I was at the ANU I never saw anybody with reports from external examiners.  The entire time I was at the ANU I never saw anybody give a publically scheduled oral examination or oral defence to defend their thesis in response to the reports of external examiners.  Apparently they all did enough for paid employment.  Where is my paid employment?  How is it that they say that I haven't done enough?  Let's see the work that they did, then, over the comparable time period.  They don't get to say that my work is crap because that's now how external examination works.  What education and training system?  It's where the best and the brightest go to die.  The death camps.  The extermination camps.  There's nobody there,  hey.  What's that Sterelny?  It's soooo hostile.  It's soooo competitive.  It's been taken over  by psychopaths and there isn't anything there.  People will give their eye teeth for paid employment it's soooo competitive!!!  Where are his eye teeth then?  Is it dead yet?  It's well over the age of 65 and it's on payroll, still?  What education and training system?  There isn't anything there.  What a f*cking farce of a joke of a hoax of a f*cking scummy scam.</p>

            <p>They want to say that people owe the government however much to repay the cost of their training.  THey enrol people in programmes of study they never even applied to be enrolled in.  They won't actually employ skilled people to teach them.  They won't do it.  All these people on payroll and their theses never went out for external examination!  THey didn't have a publically scheduled oral defence!  But they are on payroll to teach, are they?  What teaching?  What courses did Sterelny teach when he was paid Professor of the Australian National University?  ANy courses?  Any courses at all?  What education and training programme?  It takes the work from some -- and it reattributes authorship to people already on payroll.  It can't even explain it's own work much of the time.  Gee I wonder why that might be.  What a hoax of a sham of a scummy scummy scam.  There's  nothing there, hey.  The millions and millions and millions that the governments have under-paid.  How many years of paid employment am I entitled to for the work that I did for how many years as an enrolled student?</p>

            <p>Know why we don't have a health system?  Because it's soooo hostile and soooo competitive.  Nobody actually wants anybody else to live.  Is it dead yet?  We can hope and we can pray.  What education and training system?  There isn't anything there, hey.</p>
