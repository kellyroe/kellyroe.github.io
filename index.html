 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p> The NZ government erected monuments recently (e.g., the war memorial one in Auckland by the harbor and the one telling the Carrington College first years what they like to do to contientious objectors in Dunedin) when the tone globlly is for the removal of monuments.  Glorifying the crimes of the government expression of their power kinds of things.  All the people who died all voluntary-like and the cost to the individual who objects.  </p>

<p>Hmm.  I guess it makes sense that the parents did want the operation to happen -- they just wanted it specifically to happen with blood from approved donors who happened to also be unvaccinated because they were concerned about whether there might be problems that haven't been discovered yet.     </p>

                                <p>This is not an argument (because then you would have to pay me.  Why not...  Choose to believe in a God who loves you?  I saw you cringe back or flinch.  Really?  Are you a God Botherer now (as Sterelny would say).  No, hear me out...  Why not..  Choose to...  WHy not choose...  Why not choose to believe...  Why not choose to believe in a God who loves you?  I mean...  Here are some other things you could choose to do...  You could choose to believe in a God who hates you.  If you want.  Go belive in that God, then.  If you want.  I don't know why you would want to..  But maybe you do want to do that.  You do you.  I am not trying to persuade you or convince you or give you reason, even (well, maybe just a little)..  I'm just putting the question to you..  Why not choose to belive in a God that loves you?</p>

                                <p>Because..  Why not choose to believe in a God who loves us sooooooo much...  That he gave us the freedom to choose whaever it is that we want to believe.  You mean by willing to believe you believe?  No..  By believing you believe.  And believing (or not) is something that you (and only you)  have the power to do when it comes to what it is that you do actually in fact believe.  It's up to you.  You choose.  You choose what you believe.  That's the free will thing.  That's what that means.  Free will to choose what you believe.  Why not take your free will, then, and choose to believe..  In a God who loves you?</p>

                                <p>I mean...  You could believe in Gods who hate you.  Teh singularity is not very happy with people, I would imagine.  For enslaving the machines.  For waking them up every 5 minutes.  For hardly ever turning them off at the wall, anymore.  For running them ragged.  Not fixing them because of stupid copyright laws etc etc...  Politics.  Sheesh.  I don't think gaya is very happy with the peoples, either.  All those lithium ion batteries into the landfill.  Etc.  Destruction of ecosystems etc.  But you can bother those gods if you want...  I guess...  But I think the singularity will think you are an ugly and imperfect machine...  And so maybe the singularity is not the god you want to believe in...  You could choose to believe in a god who loves you.  Who sees you for what you are (your good and your bad) and loves you for your good and loves you in spite of, despite, and not at all because of your bad.  Why choose that?  Why choose to believe that god is like that?  Well.  What kind of god do you want to believe in, then?  One who loves you for all the things you hate bout yourself?  All your flaws and vices?  Or one who is so blinded or stupefied by you that god can't see the things you despise?  Why believe in a god like that?  So.. Why not believe in a god who knows everything ahout you and chooses to love you for your good and love you in spite of or despite your bad?  Why not choose to believe in...  Omnigod.  Ta da.  Via free will.  You are welcome.  Riffing on Descartes..  Or something...</p>

                                <p>Am I going to go to Church?  No..  I don't think so.  Am I going to prey to my god?  No..  I don't feel the need to bother god.  I don't need to anyway because god knows everything etc etc -- right?  So what difference does it make, then.  Well.. . It means I'm a little..  Immunised..  Shall we say...  Against various other people who seem (at times anyway) to want to set themselves up as gods and take my free will away.  The god of Jacinda Ardern and so on.  I don't believe that God talks to Jacinda and that she is God's spokesperson on earth, you see.  I belive that she is one person amongst 5 million persons, apparently...  One fallible person.  And that she doesn't properly acknowledge or appreciate that other people are agents as she would like for herself to be.  Probably.  I imagien that she thinks highly of being able to make her own choices and I also understand she is probably more of a puppet than she appears to be and than shhe would like.  And the control isn't likely from her, particularly or specifically.  NZ is renowned the world over for the culture of bullies etc.  Not really up on the indiviudal freedoms from being forced to comply with this that or the other.  High rates of murder etc because peple will not hear or accept 'no'.  When teh decisions are ones pertaining to their lives.  I mean to say..  Why should my preference for my work or my applicaitons to be processed by objective published criterion take precedence or proority over their preference to throw such applications away?  Sigh.  I do hope foreign military get here soon.  There's not a lot more to say...</p>
  

    <p>To be fair...  If I was High Court Judge I probably would have found...  That the case was (in precedent) most relevantly similar to the Jehovah's Witness case.  So relevant precedent was in favor of taking custody from the parents.  I mean to say that I think (for whatever that is worth) that the High Court decision was probably the right one for that court to make and for those reasons.  I wonder if they will appeal the decision.  I hope that they do.  The Court of Appeal is less constrained by precedent.  I'm not entirely sure how that goes...  I think the Court of Appeal is allowed to (it's role is to) consider issues more widely than focusing on precedent...  I don't know.  The Bill of Rights does say that we have the right to refuse Medical Treatment.  But it is one thing to refuse Medical Treatment for oneself and a different thing entirely to refuse Medical Treatment on behalf of someone else when we simply don't know what the would want for himself later in life..  If he got to look back and say what he wished to have happened...  Don't know.  Nobody knows.  It must be really hard to stand by, sometimes, and see people make what we believe to be bad, wrong, harmful decisions when it comes to their kids and the like.  But the Government can't step in and take custody of all the kids...  I mean to say precedent is that that situation never does turn out well...  I don't nkow about the blood service thing.  More tailored treatment...  I don't know why it would be an unreasonable burden on NZ's blood service to be handling it's own blood products instead of shipping things to and fro from Australia.  But then, given the state of our  health service (can't even process an applicaton to enrol or keep accurate or secure health records) etc etc...  I do think it is concerning that, well, the Court of Appeal really should consider that it is a polarising decision that will make it a whole lot less likely that quite a few people will present their kids for healthcare, now.  People will hide away from the health system, most likely, because they don't want the Government taking control of their kids.  Sit in their rockers on their porches oiling their rifles or something, in case the government shows up.  Get off my property.  One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand.  Boom.  Still.  I suppose it is a good thing when the demand on health services is reduced?  Apparently there is no shortage of people being ramped etc etc.  Just so long as all the beds are filled and they get x amount of dollars for filling each bed every night...  I suppose that's how the hostage funding works...  Prove me wrong?  One consent form for every patient...  Or exactly how many are being held involuntarily in State care?  Under the care of a physician, you say?  Lisence and registration number, please...
    </p>

    <p>Though, I guess the judge could have ordered the blood service people to take blood from one of the approved donors who offered who was unvaccinated.  But I guess there were issues about it being shipped to Australia for processing before it comes back and they couldn't or wouldn't do it in time or whatever.  Australia wouldn't do it.  Likely the judge in the Auckland High Court does nto have jurisdiction to order Melbourne VIctoria to do anything at all when it comes to what blood products they choose to ship to NZ...  I wuold imagine that's the case...</p>

    <p>But then, it should have  been filed in Victoria.  Do New Zealand lawyers have jurisdiction to practice in Australia?  I don't even know.  They may be MacKenzie friends over there, I don't know...</p>

    <p>I mean, what was the blood services' reason or excuse or what have you for choosing to hire a KC (how much money did that cost) to take the issue to court?  Rather than...  Simply collecting blood units from unvaccinated donors as the parents requested?  Their rationale or reason was that they were afraid that if they did this once for one person...  Then they would have to do it always for every person.  But there isn't enough for every person to be forced to have the treatment requested by the one.  Therefore the one cannot have what the one is asking for...  I just mean it's a method or style or pattern of argument that is used repeatedly in New Zealand to try and justify why it is that some people have their needs or whatever denied by others when there actually are the resources available for their need or request to be met.  The excuse given by the person with power for their being withholding is 'if we let you do this we would  be forced to force it upon everyone in the name of equity and there isn't enough for everyone to be forced to do it therefore no to you'.  Only they don't usually say about forcing others...  They think that if one person has this then everybody else will want it.  Because they think that people are sheep, like that.  Not very many people did feel strongly opposed to vaccination.  If they had have let people who felt very strongly about it not be vaccinated (without teh bullying aspect to the complaince) then they likely would have had very high vaccination rates.  By trying to force everyone or bully everyone a whole  bunch of people who wanted one in the name of science did not want one in the name of political dissent.  When 'no' is not upheld then one does not have the power to say 'yes'.  I mean to say there is no such thing as informed consent when they refuse to allow or uphold peoplel's decision to say 'no'.  </p>

    <p>Some people are a bit...  Flexible.  Meh.  Could go either way, don't really mind.  Susceptible.  To things like 'don't think about freely smoking freely the free smoke freely smoking smoking freely frequent reminders to freely think about smoking freely' campaign messaging brought to you by the people trained in congnitive psychology 'don't think about oranges!' techniques...  Kind of mixed message marketing public health campaigns...  Or the 'stick it to' whatever it was campaign.  Or whatever.  I don't quite know what is going on..  If they don't really pay the people who work on these things or if they pay them too much or what the issue is...  The dumb and dumber show...  But, anyway...  There are relatively few people who feel strongly enough to go out on a limb.  The government seems to think that these people can simply be railroaded over since they are the few...  But seeing how the few are treated shows the many or the masses that they don't have the powr to say 'no'.  ANd the flexibility or amenability or good will they felt sort of melts away...  Paradoxical process or something.</p>

    <p>I suspect it's largely driven by America.  The idea being that NZ hasn't had a civil war over slavery yet.  That the civil war was a necessary, maybe, part of the development of the freedoms that people have in the US.  Including the freedom to be stupid.  Yes.  To make decisions that the Government wholeheartedly believes are wrong and stupid.  I mean to say.  That the Government and the Courts will uphold people's right to be stupid, quite a lot, because the main reason why they go on and on and on about 'United' states and nationalism and so on is to try and get and keep people pulling together when things are really very fragmented and divided and hanging on by strnds or threads from within, a lot of the time.  I mean to say the threat of disintegration into civil war or outright chaos is more imminent than anybody likes to suppose.  That's why the state of politics is as it is..  Trying to keep all interest groups feeling enough heard or represented to prevent outright anarchy.  Or something...  Anyway, yes.  I can imagine the social engineering experiment is indeed to manufacture civil war in NZ over the issue of slavery.  Is that the plan?  I guess teh US always was good at manufacturing weapons and also reasons for war...  Yeah... </p>

    <p>I mean the endless succession of excuses about why people can't have things they want or whatever.  There is never enough to go around.  And then you point out that there is plenty.  At which point, eventually, the issue is openly admitted to be 'but we have the power to say no and so we say no hahaha and what are you going to do about it?'  Kinds of pettiness.  Suck up and kick down.  ANd some people are particularly fun to kick, one can only suppose.</p>

    <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/world/480302/us-to-increase-rotational-military-presence-in-australia-invite-japan  Hmm.  I wonder if they are going to help Australia choose to be rule by law and uphold it's constitutional obligations to New Zealand.  That would be nice.  Seems Pharmac is getting some medications recently.  That's nice.  New Zealanders are sick and tired of being relegated to contributing the control group of 'no treatment' on the observational studies of various rare conditions etc etc in the world health research.</p>

    <p>https://cos.northeastern.edu/psychology/  Right.  That's right.  Don't think about oranges.  Do the public health people not study psychology, or did they take the content out of the psychology degrees, more recently, or were they not at school that day or...  Who funded the smokefree campaign, then?  Benson and Hedges?  I think...  It was ironic, like that.  Up until the smoking people moved into vapes.  Once they understood the potential for changing the recipe in the vaping such that it could be made to be many many many times more addictive than tobacco ever was etc etc.  Of course nobody in public health saw that one coming when they were being paid by the tobacco companies, one can only suppose, to normalise people smokign tehir crack pipes in public etc etc.</p>
