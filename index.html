                                The Constitution of Australia explicitly says that New Zealand is a State of Australia.  Australia now wants to say that they don't regard New Zealand to be a State of Australia.  They have granted New Zealand 'Soverignty' by which they mean New Zealanders are not allowed to vote in Australian Federal Elections.  New Zealanders are not considered for Australian Government or Defence Jobs.  New Zealanders are not considered for Australian Student Loans or certain 'High Value' programmes of study.  New Zealanders are not eligible for Australian Pensions or Welfare etc.  There is supposed to be a process for changing the Australian Constitution, if they want to do that.  They say that New Zealand does not consent to being a State of Australia. But they won't let the people say what the people want because they aren't eligible to have their opinion considered.  Nobody in their right mind would want to be an Australian Citizen, clearly.  I suppose that is why there is no point putting the issue to the vote.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Apparently the problem is that I don't speak English.  See, when the Australian Constitution says that New Zealand is a State of Australia the Constitution means to say that New Zealand is not a State of Australia.  Yes.  Kdithiehtdkgjhfkgf.  Word salad.  Word salad.  Word salad.

                                In 2021 The Australian National University declined my application to enrol in a PhD in Philosophy on grounds that my application was 'incomplete' because they did not accept that I supplied to them a writing sample with my application.  Also because they said I did not supply a research proposal.  In fact I did supply a writing sample to them.  I provided a link to my 'Writing' page where you can see for yourself there are a number of writing samples including writing samples of PhD and Masters length theses and a Book Chapter from Oxford University Press.  It's sooooooo competitive.  It must be.  The work you need to produce for the Univesrsity before you are even allowed to START a PhD!!!  Oh my!!!  Or maybe it's completely unrelated.  I suppose you look at the writing samples provided by the students who got the offers of place. If they were even required to provide them, at all.  If they were required to purchase them from a third party or provided them by their supervisor or whatever back home.  Maybe appropriating someone else's work is a necesseary prerequisite for entry, these days.  You know, get studnets uploading their work to Turnitin so that other studnets can purchase their work from the system.  More convenient than having people living in in the frat houses to do the work of everybody in the frat, I suppose. I also have an email from Kim Sterelny saying that I was not to write a research proposal with my application to enrol.  I informed him that I was going to include a research proposal with my application (despite his really very high quality advice) and I said that I didn't really want to start all over again on a PhD with the Australian National University when they didn't seem to have the willingness and / or ability to actually process any of the work that they had received from me already.  How about a little credit for the work that I had done?  If I was to do more research it would be on the notion of 'consent' in Medicine.  Basically on how Australia does not seem to have a handle on the notion of consent.  Not when it comes to being a citizen of Australia and not when it comes to being a victim of the 'health' system, either.

                                <p>  The Vice Chancellor has directed me to complain to two separate Deans, now.  Apparently they are progressing my complaint -to no particular time-frame.  I give them 25 working days (very generous) before I complain to the courts.  ffs.  Nobody can function.  Tell the world, then, Australia, how you refuse to have a functioning judiciary (also health system also education system).  How f*cking tiresome.  I post this here so that you can make an informed decision whether you want to study with the Australian National University or whether you want to train or work in Australia.  Whether you consider how they have treated me to be fair or appropriate conduct.  What that means for the value of your own qualifications or university affiliation etc.  The Australian National University is not a private university.  It is a Public University of Australia.  It is supposed to be the premier research university.  Look into the quality of the supervision they provide and their willingness and / or ability to process the work of their studnets in a timely fashion.  How much work are you supposed to do before it is time for them to credit you as having completed the requirements of a PhD?  It is not supposed to be that f*cking hard.  Consider whether honesty and integrity is something you value.  Or if you want to be a slaver with your own personal harem.  Whatever it is that you think your University experience will be like and what place you want to take up in the world.
                                </p>

                                The Ministry of Social Development has chosen to use a lawyer to represent themselves and to do their filings for the Social Security Tribunal.  This is to defend their decision to refuse to supply advance benefit payment to a person who the courts have ordered pay more than $20,000 security for costs else cases are forced abandoned by the courts rather than progressing through the court of appeal.  You can read the high court judgments for yourself and see how the high court judges (or whatever you call Justice Toogood and Mander who have been pulled out of retirement for the occasion) who refuse to acknowledge facts and refuse to acknowledge evidence and refuse to acknowledge the half of the education act that confers duties or obligations to the universities of New Zealand and the chief executive of the New Zealand Vice Chancellors committee.  Ms Roe is denied a lawyer.  She is to represent herself as a Mackenzie friend for herself as she appears before the courts in her own private residence.  I am wondering what the difference is between there actually being a court hearing with an actual judgement delivered by an actual judge and whatever it is that the New Zealand Government seems to think that it is doing.  Who is responsible for re-hiring retired judges?  Whose job is that?  What part of their job description gives them authority to re-hire retired judges?  Apparently judges are actually academics who work for the Government rather than the University.  They write reports for the Government to ignore.  So, for example, instead of judging on the prosecution of the officials involved in wrongdoing within the Public Universities the lawyers are to write inneffectual reports making recommnedations that will  be ignored about the situation.  I don't suppose the government would pay them otherwise.

                                <p>The Tertiary Education Commission defines a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  
                            <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a>.  Justice Toogood was wrong to have asserted that I tried to complete the qualification 'early' or 'under-time'.  Error of fact.  I tried to submit it so that the customary or standard 3 months of external examination and up to 10 weeks of minor changes (typos and grammar) could be fixed up so that the hardcopy could be lodged in the library at the 34 week mark.  That is not 'early'.  That is on time.  The Universities of New Zealand (also the judiciary) don't appear to know what it is or means to get work done on time.  They refuse to allow it.  They aren't a University -- they are a detention camp.  It isn't only that they bully people into not completing their work -- it is that if you do complete your work they won't acknowledge it or progress it or process it.  When you don't do what the bullies want then you see how they choose to engage in criminal conduct to further their cause.  The bullying problem that New Zealand has is really just a front for the corruption problem that New Zealand has.  
                            </p>

                            <p>The University of Waikato offers a 120 point MPhil qualification.  That means it has been approved by the TEC as being 'right sized'.  The academic quality and integrity people, the NZVCC approved the qualification.  It is listed in the University Calendar.  I applied to be enrolled in it.  The University refuses to allow anybody to complete that qualification, however.  They believe they are entitled to require studnets to work for at least 12 months on their thesis before undergoing an external examination period of up to 3 months.  Since you are required to be enrolled at the end of the external examination period that means that if the examination period takes 3 months then you are required to be enrolled in and pay fees for an enrolment period of 12 months plus 3 months for a total of 15 months.  But it doesn't stop there.  They believe that if the external examiners say anything about changes needing to be made to the substance (e.g., a referene to be added, a section to be moved around) then they are entitled to require the studnet to re-enrol for an additional 6 months and also undergo another external examination period of up to 3 months.  That means another 9 months added.  Basically forcing the student to repeat the f*cking year.  They say that the outcome of what they like to call 'first examination' is always that the student is required to pay fees for another 9 months.  This is fairly inevitable.  That is to say, they offer the 120 point qualification with the expectation that students will end up working for at least 12 months plus 3 months plus 6 months plus 3 months for a total of 24 months (2 years).  What happens then depends a  bit on the university.  Waikato has this 'option' for the university administration whereby the studnet takes another 2 1/2 months to make minor changes.  Find another reference.  Move a comma.  Etc.  The University administration believe they have discretion to force this -- else they can say the student failed to meet their requirements and the qualification is withheld.

                            <p>Here is how much the Inland Revenue now says I owe the New Zealand Government for my 'Education' and 'Training' that are not acknowledged because New Zealand qualifications apparently expire 5 years post-graduation (well, not the Judges law degrees, apparently, but my qualifications have expired): 
  
                            <a href="judicial-review/ird-shot.pdf" target="_self"> $104,663.</a>

                            They have not provided a break-down of what courses they recorded me as having been enrolled in, in what year.  I have transcripts for some years that I will upload.  They acknowledge that I have completed BA(hons) and an MA (I can't tell whether they invoiced 1 year or 2 years or more of fees total for the MA - it looks to me from my transcript that they may have double-billed).  They refuse to acknowledge that I have completed anything since then.  They keep invoicing my student loan -- for courses that I never applied to be enrolled in (changing enrolment dates for more billings for them which make me look like I'm slow).  They take my research work, particularly, and give it to third parties without crediting me (or paying me).  
                            </p>

                            <p>The Education and Training Act 2020 (and previous iterations of the Act) all state that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible to be enrolled in whatever programme they apply to.  The Act states that when a programme is over-subscribed (more applicants than available places) then the University may use a selection criterion.  The University of Auckland published a selection criterion involving GPA, UMAT / UCAT, interview score.  They informed me that they were happy to use the grades from my previously completed qualifications -- so long as I completed a further qualification for the purposes of 'eligibility'.  They said that I was required to complete the MPhil for 'eligibility'.  But this is false.  As a domestic adult I was eligible all along.  Justice Fitzgerald acknowledged that.  They were therefore required to apply their selection criterion that they published for the purposes of accountability to my application regardless of whether or not I had completed a qualification in the last 5 years.  Justice Fitzgerald was wrong to think that just so long as they can say 'it's soooooooooo competitive' they can choose whoever they want on the basis of whatever arbitrary reasons they want (e.g., selecting 'most rape-y' from whatever private school).  They don't get to decide who is and who is not eligible.  The source of eligibility is the statute and not their discretion.  They published a selection algorithm as to how they would select students in their competitive entry programme.  They then refuse to apply their selection algorithm. What a farce.  
                            </p>

                            <p>Otago, too, thinks they get to decide what students they will enroll in what programme for whatever arbitrary (including discrimatory) reasons they want.  They don't believe that international standards apply to them or to their conduct.  Look at the choices they make (e.g., Dr Leeks).  The untrainable qualities that they value.  Do you really think that Dr Leeks would have been chosen or handpicked to be psychiatrist if he was not willing to abuse children the way that they wanted?  They handpicked him to see how many boys he could train to be girls etc.  His reward for his service was to be relocated to Melbourne.  Fires and plagues and floods.

                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  They aren't progressing the filings. They are refusing to supply applications, refusing to process applications on their academic merits.  Apparently it isn't a matter of public interest how they pick and choose people to pass themsleves off as 'doctors' in our hospitals.

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  Demanding me to pay more and more and more money to the courts else they force all my cases aborted, or abandoned.  <a href="judicial-review/sc-eyes.pdf" target="_self"> Here is the Judgement of the Supreme Court that I am attempting to appeal on the grounds that it is manifestly grotesquely unjust. </a>  It is like they have their eyes poked out.  Our highest court does not seem to have the conception of justice, at all.  It was the courts decision to delay Roe v University of Waikato proceedings until AFTER Roe v NZVCC and also until AFTER Roe v University of Auckland.  The Judge for Roe v NZVCC made all kinds of pronouncement in his judgment on the matter of Roe v University of Waikato.  That is to say instead of judging the issue he was supposed to be judging (the inaction of Chris Whelan in his capacity as CE of the NZVCC) he thought he would weigh in on whether or not I had done enough for completion of the MPhil Degree.  Clearly that is a matter of the Judge of a different case to decide!

                            <p>Una Jagose doesn't seem to have the job of instructing Crown Law to prosecute corruption within New Zealand Universities, or within the Judiciary (where judges refuse to accept evidence and where the supreme court punishes people for bringing injustices before the courts).  I suppose that is why they pay her more than half a million dollars to do that job.  They pay her to ensure the job is not done by anyone.  Not by her and not by anybody else.  The fact she is in the job prevents and prohibits the job being filled  by anyone with the willingness and ability to do the job.  It seems there is no evidence that they will accept that would attest to corruption.  None of the invoicing information that I provided (e.g., 0.5 EFTS = 120 points = 60 points = indefinate enrolment).  New Zealand does not appear to have a functioning judiciary.    <p> <a href="judicial-review/crown-law.pdf" target="_self"> Blow off response. </a>

                            <a href="judicial-review/adhbinterlocutory.pdf" target="_self"> My request for permission from the High Court to appeal their decision to award costs against me with respect to the ADHB having chosen to file motion to have my proceedings struck out rather than the ADHB having chosen to stop with involuntarily detaining people in conditions likey amounting to torture. </a>  They refused to grant me permission.  Here's how it goes.  A person complains via the appropriate channels.  The channels choose to employ people to throw away the complaints and delay progressing them and refuse to progress them.  The Privacy Commissioner, the Disability Commissioner, the Ombudsman.  These people wouldn't be on Government Payroll if they did their job in a timely fashion.  Their job is to delay and obstruct and prevent and prohibit.  Then you complain to the courts.  The judge says that when I filed with the courts I 'forced' the District Health Board to file a motion to have my proceedings struck out.  That is absurd.  They did not even try and contact me to apologise or work with me to make sure that unlawful detentions did not happen to anybody else.  They did not have to file anything at all.  The actual filings say that they don't have to file anything at all.  The case may proceed in the absense of any filings from them at all.  They could have chosen to ignore my filings and things could have progressed through the courts in their absense.  They choose to hire a Queens Council to file to have my proceedings struck out.  But the judge claims that I forced them to file a motion to have my proceedings struck out.  Therefore $5,0000 in costs is awarded against me as punishment for forcing them to file a motion to have proceedings struck out.  Because that's how the costs work.  The proceedings are not struck out (they are stayed indefinately while the courts find reasons for me to be required to re-file and re-file and re-file my filings) and costs are awarded against me because the DHB is apparently substantively correct in their filing to have my proceedings struck out.  They unlawfully detain me in conditions the UN likey would regard to be torture and the High Court Judge awards costs against me for forcing the DHB to file a motion to have my proceedings struck out.  Gaslighting.  Who appointed this judge?  Jagose?  Who is responsible for his conduct?  Maybe he isn't well.  What a shame that he can't get the help that he needs.  Genuinely.  If he can't get the help that he needs then the very least he can do is play his role in ensuring that nobody gets the help that they need.  Right?

                            I am not sure how much the problem comes from America.  I'm trying to get my head around why Harvard would give Jacinda Ardern an honorary PhD in Law.  The best sense that I can make of it is that it is sh*t-stirring. I remember watching this tv thing where some woman was travelling to tribes and there was some meeting house only the men of the tribe were allowed in apparently for cultural reasons.  She offered the men money to let her and the cameras in so she could show the people watching TV overseas the inside of the house.  They agreed to do it for money.  She was then interested to how the expressions on the faces of the women of the tribe when they realised how the men had used 'cultural reasons' as something of a garbage excuse.  They were willing to sell out for so little, you see.  Anyway, it seemed to me to be stiring the pot.  Then she packs up the cameras and leaves, you see, quite the trail of destruction, or something, behind her.  Anyway, I wondered if offering a several hundred thousand dollar of value 2 year masters to a New Zealand student to study at Harvard and then giving her an honorary PhD in law was similarly stiring the pot.  Firstly, who was the 2 year Masters awarded to?  Was that publically advertised?  Who was eligible to apply?  Who was selected for that programme?  What work did they do?  When did they graduate?  What job do they have now?  In New Zealand?  Did anybody get the scholarship at all?  Secondly, it was an interesting way for New Zealanders to learn about the recent change to our abortion laws.  The fact that the abortion laws were changed, like that, with the public being ignorant both of the laws in the first place (that were never upheld because exceptions or exemptions are the only way anything seems to happen in these parts).  If something doesn't happen by way of special exception or exemption (that is strictly not allowed) then it won't happen at all.  The places in Medical School are filled by teenagers who are entitled to be enrolled in Secondary School and only eligible to be enrolled in Tertiary Study by way of special exception or exemption from the University.  This is as opposed to domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years who are entitlted to be enrolled in the programme they have applied to.  That means the University fills the programme with their special chosen excemptions (like an 18 year old Dr Leeks back in the day and whoever is the best candidate for filling that role every year since).  I guess that's how New Zealand gets to be the detention camp of everywhere.  I suppose the immigrants are forced to lie and cheat on their applications to come here.  That way they can be sure that the people who 'choose' to immigrate to here will fit right on in and be right at home.

                            The psychopaths are determined to make criminals of us all.  Of course.

                            The reason people don't want to have vaccination (or present for healthcare generally) is not because they are ignorant of science. It is because the Government seems determined to have psychopaths passing themselves off as doctors and nurses and the like in the hospitals.  That's how you get a workforce who does the work and keeps their head down.  Then, when it's time for them to be paid it's time for them to go away.  Right?  Maybe move them to another place where they can begin their slave labor all over again.  Good idea?  The prevention and prohibition of development programme.  Must have more babies.  To do the work and curl up and die when it's time for them to be paid.
