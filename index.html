                            <p>
                            The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications.  They define a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a> 
                            </p>

                           <p>Australasian Universities believe they are entitled to simply refuse to process or progress students work, however.  Take it to court, they say.  Then the courts refuse to progress filings.   
                            </p>

                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.

                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.

                            It seems to me that the Australian Constition explicitly states that New Zealand is regarded, by them, to be a State of the Federation of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  Australia refuses to honor it's own Constitution. 
                            </p>

                            New Zealand doesn't have hospitals.  It has Shortland Street propaganda.  It has actors.  It has people playing at Medicine.  New Zealand doesn't value it's people or pay it's workers.  Now it's getting into the whole idea of a terrorist breeding programme.  The idea is that terrorism makes the leaders look good.  They get to comfort and console the people by obtaining more and more power for the central government.  The police need more and better guns than the people.  Legislate against the people having guns.  The government needs more power to involuntarily detain people who haven't done anything wrong.  New Zealand is pretty big on being an involuntary detention camp of a state.  Australia keeps New Zealanders unlawfully detained (after they have been legally released from jail) and the NZ government won't even do anyhing to help those people.  Won't make Australia honor the constitution insofar as New Zealanders are concerned.  Won't ask for help with that from China or the USA.  The leaders sold out the health of the people.  That's for sure.  They will not pay the workers.  Not even in pieces of paper so that the workers can go overseas.  Where is my Degree for all the work that I've done for the Universities?

                            What Universities?  What Universities do you see?
