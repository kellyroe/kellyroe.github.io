 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>Things I have changed my mind about.</p>

                                <p>I used to think that people who didn't want vaccines or medical treatments that doctors said were necessary were science-deniers or conspiracy theorists.  I now think that there are very good scientific reasons to be sceptical of doctors and very sceptical indeed about the aims or goals of the medical 'profession' given the aims or goals of government.</p>

                                <p>I used to think the aim or goal or government was to serve the people.  To try and make things better for more people.  Most people.  Not in the sense of trying to breed more (younger ones being happier) or trying to murder off the unhappy ones.  Not fiddling the stats like that.  Perverse incentives.   But genuinely to make things better for more of us.  Now I think that the government actually thinks that it's goal or aim or purpose or point is to charm and con and swindle the people into accepting less and less and worse and worse for their own personal advantage.</p>

                                <p>I used to think that NZ basically had a functioning health system, education system, judiciary.  Problems, to be sure, but I thought that people were, again, trying to have things develop in better directions.</p>

                                <p>I used to believe that people (most people, mostly) were good, or at least trying to be.  Aspired or aimed to things like honesty and kindness and fairness in their interactions and dealings.  </p>


                                <p>I used to think that things were merit based.  That merit would shine through.  That people could telt the basic difference, and that that meant something.  And now I need to stop and explain this because of how much has been invested in telling people with merit that they lack merit and telling people without merit that they are the meriotus ones.  Think of it this way...  What do we think you need to do to get academic merit?  (a)  Spend your time studying.  Reading.  Thinking.  Writing.  Or (b) spend your time party party partying sucking up yes sir not sir the universtiy administration?  What does academic merit mean?  Those who spend their times doing the work or those who spend theit times not doing their work choosing to seek out and destroy anybody who spends their time doing the academic work?  Meritocracy.  Why spend your time working when you could be giving blow jobs to the administration?  Paying bribe money to the writers of exams?  Paying off Crimson Education?
                                </p>

                                <p>I used to believe that the reason why NZ Universities didn't really graduate masters of PhD students (unless or untill they agreed that they never would have employment as an academic) was because the Universities most often hired people who were not very productive themseleves.  I mean to say, they hired people who did not regularly give new seminars (rather, giving old seminars) and who did not regularly get new work out for publication.  They would work for 2+ 5+ 10+ years on the very same seminar or publication.  Or they simply wouldn't do anything at all after they finished their PhD.  I thought the solution was to show them that it really was okay to do a little work every now and then.  Give a work in progress talk.  It doesn't have to be perfect.  It's okay to get work out there in a timely fashion.  But seems they showed me!  It's actually not okay to get work done within Universities.  If you get the work done they will hoard it or reattribute it to others or whatever.  The Universites are the prevention and prohibition of research and academics institutions.  That's what they are.  Ensuring that no work is ever done.  No journals.  I suppose so that the Stanford Prison Experiment can keep happening in NZ since our unique socio-cultural environment means that it's totally morally obligatory in these parts to ensure that people have more lead than the governments would legally  be allowed to feed them in every other country and so on and so forth.  Look at the only research that is allowed to be done in a timely fashion.
</p>

                                <p>--</p>

                                <p>I suppose the government is being pretty blatent, now, about withholding university qualifications from people who were enrolled in them and who did the work for them in order to re-deploy ministry officials into those positions.  To have the ministry officials pass themselves off as qualified professionals.  Who are the ministry officials?  Well, I don't know how many of the NZ government ministry officials are actually people who came here on foreign passports all voluntary-like.  Like New Zealander of the Year (born in South Africa, Educated in England) and so on...  I suppose the idea was that there weren't any people in NZ actually from NZ for one of them to be eligible for NZer of the year.  The only eligible applicant was...  Well...  When did she become a citizen?  Did she?  How much money did someone or other pay to have her crowned as NZer of the year?  It really doesn't make any sense, at all... </p>

                                <p>So Dr Ashley Bloomfield (MBChB) is Professor of the Univesrity of Auckland, now.  He does not have a PhD, any tutoring grading or lecturing experience, academic publications.  Therefore must have.  He must have been the only applicant for the postion.  Nobody with a PhD applied.  Nobody with any tutoring grading or lecturing experiece applied.  Nobody with any academic publications.  They didn't get a single applicant with any experience of working in a Univesrity environment.  Nobody from New Zealand and nobody from overseas.  With all the layoffs that AUT is doing nobody with any university experience applied or was encouraged to apply to become Professor of the University of Auckland.  Ashley Bloomfield was the best candidate for the job.  There isn't any corruption in New Zealand.  No corruption, at all.  Now that the courts have ruled that the Government does't need students to actually apply to courses for the 'University' to record that they have been enrolled in courses (and bill their student loans accordingly).  Now Ashley Bloomfield can be an independent contractor to say that he is recieving all of the government research and teaching award money for all of the research and teaching work that he is so renowned for that he gets to be made Professor of New Zealanads premier University! 
                                </p>

                                <p>I would imagine it is quite the pay cut for him (from around half a million to around a quarter of a mmillion, was it?)  I suppose, then, that the deal will come with sweeteners.  A house?  What else?  How many teenager virgins for Ashley?  But it's soooooooooo competitive and New Zealand Universities are garbage garbage garbage for the bottom feeders with no other options garbage garbage garbage.  So say they all.  AUT is garbage.  Waikato is garbage.  Otago is garbage.  NZ is garbage so Auckland certainly is garbage.  Australia, also, is garbage.  Where the garbage goes that did not get to go to the USA.  And of course the USA is garbage, as well.  Unless you pay the University you pay the University you pay the Univesrity for however many studnets you get to call garbage garbgage garbage.  What an experience!  People who refuse to get your work to externals (presumably because it's garbage) so as to prevent and prohibit you from having credit for your work so that Ashley Bloomfield can be the only applicant. The only game in town.  Wah wah wah NZ doesn't have any Medical Doctors.  Right Ashley?  Wah wah wah.  NZ doesn't have any PhD graduates.  Aren't any in the whole world -- right Ashley?  Well then, that must qualify you for ALLLLLL the jobs.  Allllllll the jobs for the Rt Honorable Dr Ashley Bloomfield MBChB PhD MD BS.  Roll up roll up roll up to be signed up for the population health qualification in how people must take their shots one way or another...</p>

                                <p>I guess the idea is that by promoting NZ as being the bottom of the garbage land it means that it can be the destination for all the experimental research that wouldn't get through the ethics boards of overseas.   Because, you know how it is, we will fill the ethics boards with pedophiles, if need be, to ensure the experiments get to keep rolling along.  That sort of explains the cameras in the ethics and psychology seminars.  How the people on staff hang their heads.  They are trying to see who lacks moral emotions.  That seems to be the ideology of it.  People who don't see anything wrong with atrocities.  Must have for everything in NZ.  MOst desirable place to be a psychopath land.  Real destination for all the garbage.  By design.</p>

                                <p>Stanford is saying now about experiments that were done on black prisoners back whenever.  They had signed consent forms and paid them a token for participating as experimental subjects.  They say that people wanted to participate because they were kept poorly enough such that they would be willing to do anything anything anything for the money.  Right?  Anyway, they are saying that it wasn't okay.  But it was in accordance with the ethics or the norms or whatever at the time.  I mean to say they would only hire employees who had that view of it, of course.  NZ is trying to normalise child abuse and so on so that people don't feel that there is anything particularly bad or wrong sending the pedophiles and the like to NZ.  It isn't like the nations in Australasia aren't fill with moral degenerates, right?  They will fit right on in.  Right?  The only sorts of things we want to know or hear about are how degenerate the people in Australasia are endemically.  We only want to hear about the nasty abuses going on within native communities, mostly, especially, so that we can justify shipping the worst of the degenerates off to the colonies to go research on other people children etc.  Right Ashley?  Did they publically advertise your job, then?  Really?  How many applicants were there for your job?</p>

                                <p>So Ashley did a Masters in Public Health.  Was that a 1 year research only masters or a 2 year Masters with maybe 1 year of coursework and a 1 year research component?  How many weeks months years did they get you working on your research component?  2 years?  Before they took another year to examine it?  You mean to say they made you take a PhD length of time (3 years including the examination period) to do 1/2 the work of a PhD?  Did they tell you that was the pathway to becoming an academic?  Did you even write a thesis?  What was your thesis about?  I'm curious because of Stuart McCutcheons being about breeding more lambs than you can feed so you can cry cry cry to the government for more money every winter else the lamb hostages will starve.  Then you use that money you got from the government for fattening them up for the spring slaughter for increased profits for yourself.  Then cry cry cry for more money from the government because you bred more lambs than you would feed through the winter unless the government gave you more and more and more money to feed them through the winter...  Quite the business marketing managing model for the University of Auckland.  Really desirable place for the very very best and brightest of the NZ studnets.  Wouldn't you say?  Must have.  Must have all the best and the brightest studnets of NZ.  Wouldn't you say?  Cry cry cry cry cry for more money from the Government for keeping the lambs going off to the slaughter.  All the Professorships for Ashley!</p>

                                <p>I suppose the idea is that it doesn't matter.  Ashley doesn't need to have a PhD to refuse to supervise studnets in their PhD research.  You can't supervise students in doing a higher level qualificiation than one you have.  Apparently that's why we don't have MD or JD research in NZ.  There isn't anybody with those qualifications to supervise those Degrees.  They are in the University Calendar for a couple of the NZ Universities, but to the best of my knowledge they don't enrol anybody in, supervise, or graduate anybody from those qualifications.  They also don't seem to be enrolling, progressing, or signing off on PhD qualifications, either.  They won't get the students work out to externals.  They won't do it.  They won't help the student get PhD.  The people collecing up all the research money don't want to share.  They want to be the only game in town.  It's sooooooo competitive.  </p>

                                <p>Most if not all of the research projects seem intentionally designed to showcase that the students are lacking in morality and / or integrity and / or knowledge and ability etc etc.  They call them 'terminal degrees' or 'terminal qualifications' because then your right to life, or something, is declared to be given up.  See, your only value is the value that you have to the University that the University can cry for more and more and more and more money from the Government for recording your enrolment and reenrollment and reenrollment and reenrollment nd reenrollment nd reenrollment collecting up more and more and more money.  What is in it for the NZ government?  Every studnet hostage does not count for unemployment or disability stats.  You say they are in 'education and training' programmes.  THen you intentionally record higher and higher and higher levels of debt against their name while refusing to get their work to externals and paying internal people to bully and abuse them.  Worst case you record that you have successfully disabled or handicapped them.  Still don't count for unemployment.  How many FTE positions, in NZ, again?  To be filled by how many people?  How many FTE positions for Ashley?  How many years did he take to complete his 1 year of research research component on his Masters?  Oh, let me guess, Auckalnd lacks the capacity to keep accurate student enrolment records and lacks the capacity to keep transcripts.  What a f*cking joke.</p>

                                <p>You see all the 'must haves' passing themselves off as Medical Doctors, in NZ.  One can only suppose they are paying sums of money in exhange for committing atrocities against the people of NZ.  It is convenient for wrongful deathbringing pedophiles to pass themselves off as Medical Doctors and teachers and the like, for obvious reasons.  THe Universities of NZ are refusing to process applications properly.  What Universities?  What skilled workers?  NZ intentionally sells out the people in order to be, effectively, the prison camp detention land of all the psychopaths shipped here from overseas.  Why the hell did we need to pay someone from England to be Dean of the Research School of the Univesrity of Waikato?  What she does is falsely record student enrolments (by saying that studnets will never get their qualifications unless they reenroll and reenroll and reenroll and reenroll and pay more and more and more money to the University) so as to double bill and keep false enrolment records and then hoard the f*cking theses and not get them out for external examination.  HOw much money do they pay the f*cking psychopath?  Why are we paying a foreigner to undermine the entire f*cking university?  THey don't have the willingness and or ability to get out of the f*cking way of their research students.  It isn't a univesrity.  THey won't do it.  Can't / won't employ anybody willing and or able to supervise graduate student research?  Can't and won't even pay people to get out of the f*cking way so that some actual f*ckign research could be f*ckign done for a f*cking change.  What is the research output of the people paid to do research?  How f*cking slow can they possibly work?  Their first year students output more research than they do ffs.  It really isn't supposed to be that f*cking hard.</p>

                                <p>So, someone with a PhD from the Australian National University (supposedly Australasias Premier Research Institution) says that having a PhD from the ANU really isn't that big of a thing or a deal.  He says that once you have your PhD you realise how many people in the world have a PhD and having one doesn't really mean anything at all.  You see the people who have PhD's and you meet them and see the work they are doing and have done and so on and you realise that having a PhD doesn't really mean anything.  I mean...  I suppose from his perspective, he had a PhD from the ANU but no academic jobs came to him.  No academic job from any University in New Zealand, particularly.  NZ or Australia.  I guess once the likes of Ashley Bloomfield take the academic positions there aren't any jobs left for anybody else.  I guess he wasn't thinking, particularly, about what it means, then, of the people who worked on their PhD for however many years and were never credited as having done enough work for one.  The idea is that when you look at the shit they say is good enough for one then you wonder just how shitty the real shit is when the shit doesn't even get credit for having done one.  They don't really think that a test that gives false negatives...  And what do we call this situation, then?  False positiives?  Attesting to the complete and utter worthlessness and meaninglessness of the whole entire enterprise.  I mean...  Who has their PhD and who doesn't does not appear to be associated with who has actually done the work.  Does not appear to be associated with the quality of the work.  Does not appear to be associated with who the examiners said should have their PhD (if they even get the work out to externals or if the decisions are being made in spite or or despite what externals have to say).  I mean to say there doesn't appear to be anything home...</p>

                                <p>So what are we left with, then?  Well.  A holding facility or detention camp for teenagers, primarily.  Takes children when they are 18.  Or as low as 14, if we are talking about AUT when it came to at least one finance studnet from Vietnam who came to NZ with her not biological Mother legal guardian...  Apparently...  They don't hire University graduates (Ashley doesn't have a PhD but he's supposed to head a graduate research school, now?)  They have no intention of producing University graduates..  It's just another NZ government institution of abuse.  The Australian National Univesrity appears to be just another Australasian institution of abuse.  By design.  Intentionally.  They collected up more and more and more and more money for having studnets enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled.  They refused to get the studnets work to externals in a timely fashion.  They intentionally seemed to move faculty around so as to say that students had been abandoned by their supervisors so they would need to start a new project again under a new supervisor or they would  never qualify to complete their qualification.  I'm looking at all the work that I did (the write ups of talks etc over on the seminars page) and wonder how many people basically took my research output and claimed it as their own and passed it off as their own overseas.  Back in the northern hemisphere or wherever.  NZ Universities handed all their studnets intellectual property over to Turnitin.  Got all of their students intellectual property uploaded into Turnitin.  So that they could fail the studnets out so that other people could go on to claim it as their own work outputs.  Who is Turnitin?  Some American company, apparently.  So that the Professors from American Universities can be attributed with what they think is the best of the work, I suppose.  Which necessitates the elimination of the person who produced it.  Or maybe just relegate them to the garbage wasteland of garbage land.  So that you can feel better about yourself.   Becuase it's sooooooo competitive.  It's sooooo competitive that NZ doesnt' even have journals.  The Philosophy Professor of the Univesrity of Auclkand gets to publish in the NZ Meidcal Students Journal (don't worry Ashley can publish in the academic journals, next, for all the hard work that he's done spending so much of his life working his way up through academia at great cost to himself.  All the investment that he has made of himself all the sacrifies he has  made.  The financial hits in doing jobs in the public service interests.  Not at all folling the path of where the money goes and where the little 18 year old virgins can be...  Drafted?  Drafted to his programme of study?  So that he can refuse to sign them off becuase it's a 'terminal masters' programme where the little researchers go to die so that alllll of the money can be given to Ashley MBChB.  Why doesn't he work with patients?  They pay him to not work with patients.  I suppose some foreigner will pay him...  Half a million dollars?  For...  1 year?  Of getting to play doctors and nurses in the NZ hospitals?  10 weeks of Orthopedic surgeon?  How much money to dump your wife at Hillmorton for the rest of her life, these days?  Just so we understand why the 'Universities' of NZ can't / won't process an application to enrol, progresseion through training, completion of trining.  Can't  / won't publically advertise jobs.  Can't / won't hire people for the jobs.  Can't / won't pay the workers.  Only the pedophile psychopaths need apply stating how much money they will invest in NZ in order to do anything anything anything they want with impunity.  We don't see any corruption, at all...</p>

                                <p>I actually don't know that we are graduating any.  Doctors.  Lawyers.  Engineers.  I think that they wait until they get people who have been struck off from overseas for atrocities and they get them.  Why?  Because they will pay and pay and pay and pay to apply for visas and the like to come to NZ.  Then we can put them to 'work' and not really pay them.  What are they going to do about our not really paying them?  They could leave, then.  We can simply replace them with a new lot of people who have been struck off from overseas because of atrocities.  That makes the worlds offenders most highly desirable, from a NZ point of view.  They can come here and be put to work.  Then we can simply not pay them.  What are they going to do?  If they protest we can take their visa back and deport them.  Are they going to go home and cry about it?  We are only interested in having the ones who are on the radar for atrocities overseas in the first place.  I would imagine or suppose.  So they can't go home and complain.  What do you expect trying to do business with psychopths?  How could you not have expected to be screwed over?  Well...  I suppose you point to high profile people..  Allegedly or apparently Dawn Freshwater is a foreigner who is apparently or alledgedly actually paid half a million NZ dollars per year to play VC of the Univesrity of Auckland.  Why would we believe that?  How does that make any sense?  Allegedly or apparently the Dean of the Research School of the Univesrity of Waikato is paid a few hundred thousand per year in order to hoard theses and refuse to get them to external examiners and refuse to get external examiers the sign off forms and refuse to allow external examiners to sign off that students have done enough for the 120 point research project they applied to be enrolled in.  Why would we believe that they pay her several hundreds of thousands to do that?  Maybe she makes quarter or half a million for the University from the false records and billings?  Is that how it doesn't work?  Is that how the University of Waikato gets to be in it's place as one of the shittest Universities with little to no research output? </p>

                                <p>I guess the money isn't just from the NZ Government.  I was like 'what is in it for the NZ government?'  I mean, they pay the University for keeping the student enrolled.  Well, they don't provide a government job for rhte student who is kept enrolled.  They don't have a graduate level entry job with the government.  So the government pays the University less money than the government would pay the student for keeping the student enrolled.  Why would the student do that?  Who in their right mind would voluntarily consent to that?  Well, then, better collect up more and more money from the government for keeping the student in teh psychiatric hospital.  How many FTE positions are there, in NZ?  To be distributed to how many people?  I mean to say that some people are working more than 1 FTE (are collecting up more than 1 FTE salary) while others are not allowed to do 1 EFT of work in 1 year.  Not because they don't have the capacity or the willingness.  They refuse to allow anybody to do it.  NZ does not have uniersities.  That means we don't have law, engineering, medicine graduates.  We don't have an eudcation and training system.  We have a fraud or a hoax upon all the people.  THe prison camp detention land of the owrld.  Australia thinks it's doing better thn NZ but it isn't.  The f*cking think tank brought to you by Wellington shipped to Canberra ffs?  Selfish selfish selfish.  So f*cking selfish.  </p>

                                <p>There was an interview...  Something about Harvard wanting to give Jacinda a big fat cheque for some reason.  For being a great leader for the Covid response.  So she chose to convert the big fat cheque into a scholarship for a student to go do a 2 year Masters Degree from Harvard with the...  Kennedy School of Leadership and Governance or something like that.  The scholarship was apparently of the value of a couple hundred thousand of NZ dollars.  That means to say the student would have accommodation and living expense money (to buy a winter coat) and textbooks and printing and photocopying and food and so on...  So they could do the programme of study.  They did not say whether it was a once off (for 1 student only to go) or whether it was an ongoing thing.  If it was 1 student per year...  For how many years...  I suppose it was a once-off thing.  For one student to go under that funding arrangment.  The total value was a couple hundred thousand NZ dollars.
                                    <p>

                                    <p>Who went?  I am intersted to know who went.  I suspect the interview was a public service announcement, from Harvard, to the people of NZ to say that they were giving Jacinda Ardern a couple hundred thousand dollars and Jacinda Ardern announced that the value of that would be transferred to a student.  Who was the student?  I am wanting go know for the purposes of accountability.  When did they graduate?  Or did they get no applications?  Did anybody apply?  How many applications did they get?  Were they all deemed 'ineligible to have applied'?</p>

                                    <p>I think it was 2 years later that Jacinda went to Harvard commencement / graduation ceremony.  She wasn't the receipient of the 2 year masters degree, though, was she?  I mean, that was a different thing...  She got an honorary degree.  There are particular letters to indicate Honorary Degree title or status.  She did not get the 2 year masters degree.  That was for not-her.  That was for someone-else.  Did she see the student graduate in the qualification that was associated with the scholarship in her honor?  I wonder the fate of the student...  Did they get an entry level job with the government of NZ after having graduated from the 2 year masters with Harvard?  What are they doing now?  Did they graduate?  Did they return to NZ?  Are tehy locked up in a psyh facility?  Or did the NZ government enrol them in a PhD with a NZ Universitiy (to be deteained indefinately with non pay).  Are they to be enrolled in the Ashley Bloomfield Institution of Research, now?  Where nobody will graduate them with a PhD because Ashley can't supervise PhD level research because he doesn't have a PhD...  Does anybody in NZ have a PhD?  Did the external examienrs sign the sign off forms did they?  I'd love to see signed externl examiner forms...  I am starting to believe that there very well might not be any...</p>

                                    <p>I mean to say I think that maybe the situation is that NZ doesn't actually have any education and training programmes at all.  Australia doesn't either.  We just get shipped the criminals and undesirables from teh Northern Hemisphere.  Or they pay us to do a little 'working holiday' where tehy pay us to do anything anything anything for 10 weeks (Orthopedic Surgery) or whatever it is.  Most of the medical doctors are only here on a temporary basis.  Right?  Visit NZ..  Do a little travelling..  A few 'operations'...  Then ride on out.  Impunity for your crimes.  Cheapest workforce ever where the government is only funded by the proceedds of crime..</p>

                                    <p>Jacinda told them at graduation that abortion was legalised in NZ.  They could look into that and see that nobody had been prosecuted for having performed one and infact we have about the highest rates of abortion.  In fact it woul dbe quite the place to go to if you wanted to early harvest foetal tissue.  Do all your gene studies of implanting embryos that were absolute knock outs all your designer babies.  Implant them in people kept in state care, harvest them from people kept in state care.  Not be held accountable.  Not very long after this Otago gets a big charitable donation, apparently, from an American who wants specifically to enrol lin the cheapest Medical Degree ever in teh english speaking world so that they can donate all the rest o fthe money towards setting up a gene research facility in the honor of a dead infant that they now want to be selected into the training programme for or of.  Quite the destination.  Just so it is that we can understand why the leaders of NZ are throwing away teh applications to enrol.  Will not process applications to enrol from NZ students.  NZers aren't eligible to work those jobs.  People from the NOrthern Hemisphere pay a bunch of money to gome here dn do anything anything anything commit atrocities against the NZ people and the NZ governmetn nd judiciary...  Well...  It's in the bag with Justice Toogood.  I suppose.  He got a 2 year Masters from Yale.  He did not get a JD from the Law School.  He did not go to Law School in the USA.  Fraud upon all the people.</p>

                                    <p>Oh what's that?  Then you must run away.  Go be a third rate American, then.  Better thaan being a NZer.  I mean NZ doesn't have a health system education system functioning Judiciary.  Well.  Neither does America, so far as I can see.  Harvard appears to be wanting to associate with the likes of Jacinda Arden and arrange for people to go commit crimes in NZ.  Quite the destination for the all the 'hgih value people'.  Yeah, right.</p>

                                    <p>However many years ago Benjamin Gibbs resigned from the University of Waikato because they were refusing to get a particular students PhD thesis out to external examiners.  They thought (the administration thought) that  by labelling the thesis a 'neo-Nazi manifesto' they were entitled to hoard it in their trophy room and refuse to get it out to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit the student from being signed off as having done enough for a PhD from the University of Waikato if and only if independent external examiners judged his thesis to be of high enough academic quality for that qualification.  That is or means to say, the University decided that it was not a University, at all.  It was going to refuse to be part of international community and it was going to refuse to listen to international community voice.  People who were on the 'university' payroll thought that they should get to decide whether the student gets their PhD from their institution or not.  Their job was not to help their student be accepted by and part of international community, at all.  Their job was to prevent and prohibit their students (their property) from being seen or being part of international community by hoarding various things away.  Or by simply giving various things away.  Giving their studnets work away to externals with permission for externals to do anything they wanted with the work (including passing it off as their own or the work of one of their own studnets, one can only suppose).  Corruption.</p>

                                    <p>What Universities?  What research output?  The University of Waikato intentionally covered for Alister Gunn after a students mother complained about an inappropriate message that he left on her teenage daughters phone when he was involved in teaching 'Philosophy in the local girls High Schools' programme.  I guess it's soooo competitive that the HIgh School students feel pressure to do anything anything anything in order to get a reference to go to any University at alll.  I mean, imagine how garbage everybody will think they must be if they fail out of a First Year Philsophy Advance Placement (yeah right) Ethics course that they are doing when they are at High School.  He mysteriously up and died so thehy didn't need to investigate.  Yeah, right.  WOnder what ALister Gunn formerly Ethics Professor (was he?) at the Univesrity of Waikato is up to or is doing now?  Probably persuading or convincing the world that this that and the other is all locally or regionally morally and ethically acceptable in fact compulsory in these parts.  Hey, let's get Tim Dare to write with various people to say that it's practically morally obligatory to target 'vulnerable children' for state care uplifts so that they can be better targeted by the known pedophiles and offenders who...  Pay the NZ government, do they?  Do they pay the government?  In order to commit atrocities against the people of NZ because it's all 'morally compulsory' that that kind of thing happen in these parts.  Write them all up as disabled degenerates who can't even read.  Right?  That must be right...  THey can't even fill out an application to enrol form.  THey no speak the English.  They can ask for one and none will be supplied.  All of the training places for the kiddies who bribe the university officials who bribe the university officials who bribe the 'university' officials.  Who apparently lack the capacity to process an application according with the published criterion.  Throwing the applicaitons away.  There is no alternative to the nasty degenerates that must be the ones specially handpicked to be on government payroll.  </p>

                                    <p>The University of Auckland says that the reports of external examiners are commissioned by and owned by the 'University'.  They say they are confidential and will not be shown to studnets. That is or means to say the Univesrity tells the students what the University wants to tell the studnents about whether or not they have 'done enough' for a PhD qualification.  THey are not making decisions on the basis of the examiners reports (one can only imagine that that is why the refuse to supply the reports to the studnets).  So they can tell the students that the examiners said this that and the other and the student doesn't have any choice but to believe them, hand over more and more nd more money for reenrollment and reenrollment and reenrollment, else limp away.  Never to get any employment to work in academia.  Right?  Slowest worker ever.  Right?  Can't even output the research output of a first year student for every year of PhD enrolment.  Right?  The 'Univesrities' of Australasia...  Where the brains go to be tasered to death.  Where researchsers go to be incapacitated handicapped disabled.  Decommissioned.  SO that we can listen to Sterelny go on about Dawkins selfish genes and about how we are busily breeding people to approximate cockroaches as much as possible. To withstand nuclear strike.  The great vision of humanity from the only people on Philosophy Payroll!  What humanity?  What people?  What vision?  What health?  What education?  Nothing to see...  NOthing nothing nothing at all.  What's that?  Taken over by psychopaths.  Grubby grub grub up all the money and all the titles and all the honors and all the qualificiations...  So everybody else can sit around all day going yes sir yes sir three bags full sir anything you say sir and take their shots on demand.  Vaccine or euthanasia.  It's all the same -- right?  Do what you are told when you are told because you are told.  Voluntarily and wllingly.  That's what voluntary means.  It mens you have been volunteered.  </p>

                                    <p>The Australaian Constitution states clearly that NZ is a State of Australia.  No election has been held such that the constitution has been changed and NZ's status as State rescinded.  There has not been an election to have NZ removed from it's position as being a State of Australia.  Australia will not supply Federal Election voting papers to NZers even though many of them were born in a state of Australia (that is to say NZ).  Australia will not process applications from NZers for certain things they consider 'high value'.  Australia chooses to treat NZ as an off-shore detention camp of Australia.  New Manus Island.  May was well be called.  Every now and then you see snippets to realise that that is the case.  For example, isn't it Australia who orders for however many NZ dollars to be printed in Canada?  Every now and then it becomes obvious that it is Australia really calling the shots on the way that things are done in NZ.  I guess the idea/l is to limit the movement of the people so that it is easier to re-deploy the offenders kept on government payroll.  Move the likes of Alister around.  Move the likes of Dr Leeks around.  Kim Sterelny.  Harlene Hayes.  Move the sh*t around.  People keep away from them as their reputations preceed them. The shit that was going to be expediated at Otago is going ot be expediated at Western Australia now?  Go commit atrocities on the aboriginal people, I would imagine or suppose.  Send your 18 year old psychopaths to go commit atrocities on the aboriginal people.  Nobody will listen or care if they complain about having been absued by people who..  Pay the government, pay teh government, pay the government, pay the government.  I suppose.  </p>

                                    <p>So, when some people from NZ get sick they get airlifted to Sydney.  That is another way in which it is obvious.  Nobody cares what happens to the NZ health system (nobody cares if there is not one at all) because they airlift some people out. Only the degenerates are left here.  That's the idea/l -- right?  For this to be, effectively, a prison camp  for degenerates.  Make it a beacon or a magnet by design.  See how much money people wil pay into the edu-tourism to come here and do anytyhing anything anything with impunity.  Right?  Where is the evidence to the contrary?  All the work that goes into undermining and stabotaging and preventing and prohibiting development.  All the work that goes into refusing to get theses out to exernals.  All the work that goes into refusing to proess applications.  Allt he work that goes into throwing applications away.  All the work that goes into bullying studnets into slaving and handing over their work.  All the work that goes into being a f*cking arsehole.  All the work that goes into ensuring there is litlte to no research ouptput and the only messaging they will listen to is 'there is no alternative to the selfish f*cking psychopaths'.  Cooperation did not evolve.  It didn't.  I don't see any co-operation -- do you?  Coorination in the ultimate goal of ruining things for us all lis not the same thing.  Not the same thing, at all.  ALl the work and energy and effort that goes into ensuring that there aren't ny people to see...  No people..  No peple...  No people.  NOhting of anyl meaning or value or purpose at all.  No knowledge.  No truth.  No education.  Justice.  University.  NOthing.  Nada.  Zip.  Zilch.  Zero.  Sort of Harry Harlow Primate Research Laboratory of Australasia.  How to  breed an underclass of degenerates.  Right?</p>

                                    <p>For example, Chris Cairnes?  Most esteemed cricketer, of New Zealand -- right?  What did they do to him?  Botched an aortic anuerism repair so as to render him paralysed.  Now they (people in Sydney) get how much money, to keep him, again?  How much money do they get for holding him every night that they hold him in some 'rehabiliation' facility.  WOrkign really hard at the prevention and prohibition of his ever walking again?  Wasn't that right?  Only the very very very best of the healthcare for the NZers.  That's what the very very best looks like?  In the race to the bottom, yeah right.  Not so very many years ago there was a report into the VC of Queensland knowing that his daughter was given enrolment in Medicine when she was not rank order scored high enough to receive a place (he was informed of that fact, and he knew it before she received her offer of enrolment).  She was enrolled.  There was some investigation and he was required to stand down.  Where has been re-deployed to, now?  Is he CE of the public hospital system so he can ensure she gets to be surgeon or whatever he wants her to  be regardless of the quality of her application?  Anyway...  It was after he resigned / after the inquiry saying that it was corrupt (but no prosecution would occur and they were happy to see her recorded as being a graduate of the programme - to really advertise why someone might want ot be VC even when tehy don't pay them to be VC, I suppose)...  Anyway...  It was after that that Chris Whelan was paid quarter of a million NZ dollars per year to refuse to process or progress any complaints of wrong-doing for any of hte 'Universities' of NZ.  </p>

                                    <p>I mean to say that the report of inquiry into misconduct of the University of Queensland had the function (perhaps aim or goal) of advertising to the world that it might be desirable to be VC of an Australasian University (even if they don't pay you -- even if you pay them) so that your children can be given enrolment into and graduation from the Medical School of the fine institution.  THe only consequence is that you may  nee to step down.  Which, if you are paying them in order to do anything anything anything you like means that you stop paying them is all it mens.  It wasn't like they actually paid yuo anything anyway.  Right?  Isn't that the main draw for Austaralasia?  How corruptu things are, here, where people from the Northern Hemisphere come here and do anyting anyting they likfe for super special cheap with impunity?  I mean...  The legal system refuses to prosecute corruption and refuses to find in the interests of justice...  Things have gotten worse, now, since then.  I suppose that was because the funciton of the report was to advertise Australasian Universities as being fundamentally corrupt where the Judiciary was, effectively, promising never to find such pratices corrupt.</p>

                                    <p>So...  What rehabiliation programme in Sydney?  I don't know how much money some people paid in order to get to do anything anytihng anything to the cricket guy for a while.  QUite a few kids like to experiment on gettin gin there and having a go doing operations on young athletes.  So pretty.  I supose the NZ rugby girls would be n obvious target.  They know what happens in sports involving repeated head concussin.  Therefore we must withhold helmets and put force plates into their teeth and document the head trauma resulting from being beaten about the head repeatedly in the name of national sport.  There will be reparation for hte athletes?  THey look out for or after their healtlhcare.  Right?  I don't know..  Check Olivia's health records.  To see the healthcare she was provided while she was int eh state care institution of cycling NZ.  If she was suicidal there probably would be expected to be some record.  It is strange indeed to think that she would voluntarily kill herself just when it appearedt hat things were going to change for the better within cycling NZ.  (Yeah right. Justice it's in the bag with Toogooe was appointed to cover up yet another wrongful death in state care.  He apparently couldn't access the University internet records to see when Mason disappeared from being online to pinpoint his time of death.  Notn possible to see who was AV recorded as having left his room around that time.  Course not).  Are we more corrupt than South Africa?  Apparently people pay however much to come here from South Africa and have their wives indefinately detained in Hillmorton.  That's how corrupt we are.  Does not make any sense -- right?  What a f*cking farce.</p>

                                    <p>We have discovered the nature of good, in psychopath-land.  See, it actually turns out that it is evil.  'Law' is a thing or a mechanism that the government uses with which to persectute the people.  The Government accuses civilians (like Tamaki) of being a threat to the government (since people might vote for him) so he gets prophylactically imprisoned for his crimes against the government.  That's what law is for.  Just so you know.  Want to know the point or purpose of the 'education' or 'health' system?  The (prevention and prohibition of) justice or health or work and income?  All the things...  In upside down and back to front land.  Inside out land.  Psychopath-land.  They won't publically advertise jobs.  They won't properly progress or process applications for the jobs (they throw them away for no good reason and give them to people on grounds of their being racist psychopathic arseholes) they won't pay the workers.  They won't acknowledge the work that's been done.  They won't pay the workers.  They use the courts to heap abuse upon those who have already been wronged.  To teach the people a little lesson in how the ministry of injustice and the judiciary (judges hauled out of retirement and not even appointed by proper process) think that the point purpose and function of their job is to compound injustice for the good of...  Uh, for the good of, uh..  I don't know.  Maybe Justice Toogood thinks he'll be airlifted to Sydney, or something, if he gets sick.  Or maybe he just doesn't think.  I have no f*cking idea what the hell he is thinking.  If he even writes his own judgmeents, which there really is no reason to believe that he does.  Likely the interns write the judgments.  Right?  Before they ship them off to be sexually molested in the firms...   No, they had to show their willingess to shut the f*ck up about that before they would hire them as interns for the High Court Judges.  Of course.  What social services?  What government?  What's that Jacinda?  Everyone cheats on their election donations?  Because why?  Becuase none of the people currently in power would be in power if they hadn't have cheated.  Right.  Good to know.  How much did Harvard pay you to say that to the camera?  I guess if they photoshopped it...  Uh...  What are you going to do about it?  </p>

                                    <p>All the work that I did while I was enrolled in the PhD programme of the Australian National University.  The University has records kept that appear to say that everything was on track and they expected me to have converted my draft into something that would go to examiners in 3 months.  Now, what evidence is it that anybody from the ANU told that to me?  What evidence is there that they told me anything at all?  What evidence is there of them setting me readings,  having meetings with me, telling me about what they thought of the state of my progress?  In person meetings...  One or two or three?  Maybe?  Me going to morning tea is not a supervision meeting.  What the hell are they on payroll for?  Is it my job to chase them?  Whose job was it to supervise me?  They are paid to do what, now?  I am paid to write a thesis, I believe.  I wrote them a thesis.  The least they can do (the absolute least) is get the f*cking work to the external examiners.  Did I submit it in soft-copy?  No I did not.  Did they give me a date that I needed to do that?  What happened with ALL THE OTHER STUDENTS.  The were supplied dates by their supervisor -- right?  Their supervisor said that they should or could submit it on a certain date.  I'm still waiting...  F*cking yeah, right.  Not a University at all.  Apparently it's not their job to chase me.  They didn't need to chase me.  Sending me a f*cking email saying 'you need to submit it in softbound on x date in order to complete in a timely fashion' is not chasing me.  Information.  F*cking psychopath.</p>

                                    <p>And really the worst of it is how they are choosing to act or respond to things NOW.  That's the worst of it.  When I bring this to the attention of the adminstration particularly and they instruct me to submit complaint after comlaint after complaint sayign that my complaint doeson't count as a complaint and I need to revise and resubmit my complaint because they don't acknoweldge receipt of my complaint.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                                    <p>I guess they think it doesn't matter because nobody listens to me.  Because they will still get more applicants than they want to offer enrolment to.  They are still getting pretty girls, maybe, so they can parade them in their party frocks to the tourists.  They are still getting people paying a bunch of money to visit Australia from the US.  Still getting a bunch of students, even, investing in visiting for a while for the tourist dollars.  Of course.  That's what university is about.  That's why it's such an academically stimulating environment (yeah right) so people can hear the psychopaths preech their version of psychopathy.  The only game in town.  The only thing the governmetn will fund.  Philsoophy is just second rate science for all the people too stupid to do science.  Right?  So they can sign off on the acceptability of all the animal torture and people torture experiments because people are just peculiar primates.  Right?  Who should be kept in conditions of love.  Right Harry Harlow?  What's that?  YOur research doens't have in vivo real world  applicability . Well, then best get busy busy busy with the social engineering to bring your primate research lab to life!  Just think of all the things we are learning from Professor Glue's Glue Factory!  Don't worry about Psychiatry, they are focused on further incapaciating only the lowest of the lowest of the lowest of the low.  Right?  Not the likes of you or me!  First they came for the x and I did nothing because I was not x..  And then they came for...  Just imagine the 'must haves' who must be the only game in town for getting on board with the projects for the incapacitation and disablement of the population of NZ.  People who were born here, though not fault of their own.  The only game in town.  There is non alternative.</p>

                                    <p>I guess, to be fair, that appointing Ashley Bloomfield...  Sir..  Saint (I forgot that one).  Lord.  Master.  Doctor.  Judge.  That will be next -- right?  Appointing someone who is marketed or con-municated as being respectable and honest and...  Not 'just doing his job' but, 'just  being himself' apparently...  The ideology behind it, I suppose, will be to do with the international students who paid a lot of money to do Health Science First Year at the Univesrity of Auckland.  At least, they used to.  In fact, more than that.  Some people's parents paid a bunch of money for them to come to NZ as Secondary Students.  Even Primary Students.  Right?  As young as 7?  Was it?  To be kept in NZ educational institutions or facilities...  In the hope they might be proclaimed 'doctor' and make a living wage.  Maybe so their family can immigrate to NZ and the doctors wage can support the whole family.  Whatever.  Anyway, point is or was that it wasn't very good...  Marketing.  It wasn't a very good con-munication from NZ to see how obviously low-value the Public or Population Health 'pathway' (shall we call it) to Medicine was...  So I suppose it's some kind or sort of attempt to..  Market... I suppose...  The programme to international students.  So that they are okay about their children being enrolled in that one and not being enrolled in MBChB.  I mean, if all you seek is to have as much power over individuals to do anything anything anything then unlawfully ordering the entire country into a state of prison (stay home detention) would be pretty high up there.  Right?  Don't you think (hope) that future generations will look back on this time and go 'how or why could that possibly have happened?  How the hell is it that the government of NZ could scaremonger the people into just staying home one day...  And staying there for how much into the indefinate future?  Because the con-munications from overseas were that people were dying from a virus that we didn't know much about.  What reason was there, actually, to beleive any of that.  Body bags were being piled up in the streets.  Yes.  But people usually do die...  What was different?  Carryign capacity was exceeded.  Like what happens t othe chickens etc when you keep them too many to a free rnge cage nd they start pecking each other to death.  The governments.  I suppose.  </p>

                                    <p>I suppose it is actually the case that I have the largest studnet loan of anybody in this entire country.  It's supposed to serve as a lesson to everybody in New Zealand, maybe even the entire world about how there aren't Universities.  There are prison slave detention camps.  They aren't getting the students work out to external examiners so that it can be examined on it's academic merits.  They aren't grading work properly.  And now I'm supposed to conveniently vanish or disapper. Since I am the (presntly anyway) living evidence of their crimes.  That they chose to do that to me.  That they chose to encourage me only in things that were supposed to set me up to fail.  I asked people about my research projects -- they could have been directive about what I was working on with my independent research.  They chose to encourage me to do the research that I did.  The topics that I worked on.  You can see on the writing page how Justine Kingsbury encouraged me to do a project on 'disability and equity in medicine and public health' (basically concluding that there wasn't anhy equity and 'disability' was used as an excuse for treating people poorly so the idea of refrainign from discriminating against didn't even make any sense when the whole point of the label was to stigmatise).  Kim Sterelny was my supervisor for how many years?  For how many years in Australia?  HOw many years?  They won't supervise me.  Okay.  They wont' get my work to external examiners.  They won't allow externals to sign off on qualification completions.  They won't allow me to apply for employment or jobs that require those qualifications.  They won't acknowledge that I have finished being a student of Philosophy.  How many years to expertise, was it?  While they collect up all the money all the money all the money.  So, how much research does Justine Kingsbury output, then, for every year that she has been on payroll with the Univesrity of Waikato?  I offered to jointly get an article based on my Masters to a journal for publication...  I could work on it with her for a couple months over the summer after I finished my Masters.  But turns out she'd rather have me failed out of the University and have no research outupts at all.  The aim or the goal or the purpose or the point of the Univesriteis.  It seems.  TO have no research outputs at all.  Just put the work into a dungeon of some kind and bully the studnets into fleeing. T here's nothing there. </p>

                                    <p>So the whole point the aim the purpose the goal is to keep Stanford Prison types of 'experiments' (actually observational studies) or keeping people as poorly as possible.  Bullying and abusing.  Why?  Why not!!!  When you are getting away with it, why the hell not!  THe Prisons and the Schools and the Universities and the Hospitals and so on and so forth.  The aim the goal the purpose or the point. To keep as many people as badly and poorly as possible.  To cry and cry and cry for more and more and more money so you can treat more and morea nd more people worse and worse and worse.  Who will be picked to lead these camps!!!  Who will be picked to be paid and paid and paid to commit these atrocities?  Who will be on government payroll!!!  Now you can simply redeploy all the government workers from one prison or detention camp to another.  It's all the same.  Doesn't matter whether they trained in or worked in the prisons schools quarantine facilities hospitals.  It's all the same.  Right Chris?  It's all the same.  You record that people are owing money.  You record that they are stupid.  They are disabled.  They are morally reprehensible.  They are bad and they are mad and they are poor and they are disabled.  Not in the way that anybody will feel empathy.  But in the nasty degenerate 'just die alrady' kind of a way.  As many people as poorly as possible.  Right?  The whole 'how low can we go' programme. The prevention and prohbition of social and economic and everthing else of any value or worth development programme. The race to the bottom.  </p>

                                    <p>What research ouptuts?</p>

                                    <p>What 'helping'?  Seriously?  The 'helping me helping me helping me help myself to you' programme?  Was it?  </p>

                                    <p>Apparently there are engineering graduates.  Are there jobs for engineers?  I suppose there is never any shorage for the need for deep pits where to bury the bodies, and the like.  Buildings to house the people kept in detention.  Another slum.  Another not fit for purpose prison camp (school, hospital) intentionally designed to be not fit by and for design.  </p>

                                    <p>For how long are people supposed to beleive that they are just really really really bad at being good?  Before you see that they are perhaps really really really good at  being bad?</p>

                                    <p>When a normal person hears 'privacy' they think about privacy meaning something along the lines of..  Being able to..  I don't know.  Pick ones nose.  Discretely.  That is to say, without ones doing so being something that other people see them do.  Having privacy.  Closing the door and thinking that what you do behind closed doors is private.  Not because you are raping 20 virgins who you blackbirded to be given to Chris Whelan or Ashley Bloomfield in exchange for them signing off on completion of study for some other student from that nation..  But privacy to do mundane or trival things that would cause embarrassment or similar were they to be made public.  The standard example, is doing things like picking your nose.  The thought is that everybody needs to clear crap out of their nose every now and then (so everyone can relate to the need to do that) and most people have a sense of decorum or similar such that they would prefer to do such things in private.</p>

                                    <p>The New Zealand Government also Law does not have that conception of privacy.  They think that privacy is when the Government withholds records about a person from that person.  So, for example, the New Zealand Government keeps records whereby I owe the NZ Government....  What is it?  Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars that they have loaned me so I could invest in my education...  THe thought that it would be a good financial thing for them to do.  To record levels of debt against my name that I borrowed to give to the Universities of NZ in the form of fees (I didn't spend that on my own personal stuff.  I spend course related costs on text-books and computer items for writing and printing assignments I kept records of what I spend my course related costs money on always because I knew it was auditable).  THey also gave the Universities (apparently) more money up front or out right for having recorded me as haivng been enrolled than they ever recorded agaist my name.  I mean to say I have brought thae Univesrities of NZ how much money over the years?  Money that they kept getting kept getting kept getting for having me.  While they record me as... Well...  They are happly to write me up as 'first in class' until they realise they will get even more money if they write that they failed me for essays because they tink I'm not literate anymore.  Apparently.  They have the authority to decide what they want and I must be required to do anything anything anything .  I should go to an in person meeting so they can explain to me why they are withholding passing grades from me because they collect more nd more nd more and more and more money for kepeing me enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled.  ANd they don't have any research outputs to speak of.  And mine are hidden away.  Handed to others?  To pass off as their own?  To be whitewashed and presented by armies of government employees?  </p>

                                    <p>Anyway...  The point is..  Cry cry cry about how 'free software companies' are violating NZ childrens privacy by having information about the children.  But the NZ government does not think that NZ children have the right to privacy.  They don't think that they have the right to not  be molested in the schools.  They don't have the right to that kind of privacy.  They don't hav ethe right to the content of their examinations being private or confidential to internal -- so internal hands the content (unaltered) over to external examiners.  They don't beleive that the studnet has privacy in their submissions for examination.  THey don't believe that the student has privacy at all.  They don't believe that the reports of examiners are reports about the studnets work tkhat should go to the studnets.  Between the exteranal examiners and what they are saying the studnet needs to do before the external will sign off.  They think that privacy is when the slavers keep records about their slaves and the records about the slaves are private to the slavers and not viewable by the slaves.  Not alterable in light that they have kept are choosing to keep false records. </p>

                                    <p>See..  It will be obvious to international community that various people in NZ can read and so on.  That they can do academics.  But the NZ government has written them up as degenerate criminal illiterates etc etc.  So as to, you know, give all the governmetn jobs to the bullies and abusers and so on.</p>

                                    <p>F*cking Weltec.  What happened?  Oh, don't worry about her.  What's that?  The only people who don't get 1 year level 5 certificates from Weltec are the hopeless degenerates.  The ones with abosolutely no reading writing or arithmetic.  The ones with no ability to turn up to school on time.  The ones with no ability to folow basic instructions.  The ones with no ability to do any reading or any maths of the most basic level at all.  Don't worry about her.  Don't worry abotu failing her.  Don't worry about recording that she failed.  Don't worry about her.  All this extra money to hire people to go chase up the studnets who aren't in class (to drive them to class) so they don't fail those studnets out.  Don't worry about failing her out.  We gave her a first in class for physiology so that means we will record that she failed the entire qualification hahahahhahaha.  Guess she'll jlsut need to reenroll and reenroll and reenroll nd reenroll and be reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled.   I mean, oh me oh my if we passed the likes of her then we would need to pass everyone and then the qualification would mean nothing.  Rawk rawk rawk scream the f*cking vultures.</p>

                                    <p>It isn't tall poppy syndrome.  I don't know what it is.  That people get it into their heads that it's so f*ckign fun for htem to be such f*cking arseholes to me.</p>

                                    <p>When I was at primary school (I was a kid, it's not my f*cking fault) they made an executive decision to year advance me with around 4 or something other kids.  Then they put us with a teacher who is mean (compared to the other teacher who did not have the year advance class).  So I got Mrs Pilcher who was a mean b*tch.  I was the only kid in the class who didn't get to play sport because I wasn't 7 yet.  She spent all year telling me that I shouldn't be in her class.  Etc.  Because she didn't believe in year advance.  Therefore I mustn't have any social skills.  And if that meant she publically mocked me and so on so that the kids learned from her that that was how to treat me then that was what she was going to do to drive her point home.  Miss Dobbs had the rest of my hear cohort and she was lovely.  Then Mr Ashby who they ended up having to let go because he would slam 1 m rulers down on people's desks so as to make everybody too wound-up and anxious to do maths.  He missed one day and actually hit a kids fingers very hard so he had to be deployed to who knows where.  Instead of Mrs Rosemergy who was lovely.  Then Mrs Howe.  Who was also a mean b*tch.  My desk was messy.  Instead of her helping me keep it cleaner (mostly by encouraging me to focus on putting things away tidily instead of being focused on getting things ready for the next activity) she decided to make a public example of me by having me keep my stuff in an open box.  Kids would throw rubbish in there and she would find this very amusing.  She took great delight in telling me that she found me to be unsettled in her class therefore she woudl hold me back for another year and I would be with her for another year.  </p>

                                    <p>I remember being very very very very upset about that.  It was the first I had heard of my going to intermediate a year early (I didn't know that the school was actually contemplating that and that that was the purpose or point of the advance placement).  But the other stndard 4 teacher was Mr Ussher who everybody liked a lot.  I really really really liked him because I respected him because he seemed to me to be tough but fair.  So he would enforce meaningful consequences for people when they were talking while he was instructing and so on.  ANd he was knowledgeable and kind and so on.  I was very very upset about not wanting to spend another year with Mrs Howe b*tch woman.  So instead I was placed in his class.  But then I was required to do an extension class every week with his wife who was a b*tch.  I remember doing worthless extesion activities like writing our name in big bold and coloring it in.  Just stup*d shit.  Taking a few of us out of the standard curriculum class.  While..  What?  The other kids did math or something, I suppose.</p>

                                    <p>New Zealand schools.  Right?  I remember the district inspectors visiting.  I remember Mrs Howes class, actually when they asked about if we knew how popcorn was discovered or invented.  I actually did know.  They were very disappointed that I stole their thunder.  They asked how I knew and I said I read it in an encyclopedia.  Which I had.  My Mother had kids encyclopedias at home.  SO when I asked questions we could look them up.  And the entries were kind of interesting so I read more widely and I remember reading abou that one.  Mr Ussher would also let me in the room with the reading comprehension cards.  So I could read those...  The reading comprehension level assessment tests.  Because I liked reading the stories.  I remember there were stories about Marie Currie and all kinds of things.  They were well written and clear and so on.</p>

                                    <p>So, of course, that's a great reason to keep me poorly so I can slave and slave and slave and slave for no credit.  SO the people chosen picked out to be district inspectors (don't worry about her she'll be okay) can ensure that I get failed out of Weltec (don't worry abotu her she'll be okay) and not get my work to externals.  Just stay with Mrs Howe forever so she can keep your things as the public rubbish heap.  Right?  That'll teach her to..  Teach me to what, exactly?  That will teach me what?  What am I supposed to do?  Get better at keeping my head down and blending in.  Nobody ever helped me do that.  THey just publically mocked me.  Really.  That's my problem then.  The incredibly toxic envrionment.  Yeah.</p>

                                    <p>Dspite that I have had really great friends in my life, at times, over the years.  And I read..  I can lean vicariously quite a lot of how things go and what sorts of things people can do whewn tehy don't find themselves targeted in susch incredibly toxic enviornments.</p>

                                    <p>There will be no psychiatry in NZ for teh same reason tehre will be no medicine, no surgery,  no education, no law, nothing nothing nothing.  There will be nothing at all.  There's nothing here.  Nothing to see.  Just a dream land for pedophile rapist bully abusers.  Why is NZ called the land of the long white cloud?  Because people like to try and cover up their..  MIstakes?  Yeah.  That's right.  All I am is a unsightly reminder of everything wrong.  I guess.  Just waiting for them to murder me off now.  Right?  I mean...  THey don't publicaly advertise jobs.  They aren't interested in hiring the person with the relevant experience or qualifiations or whatever.  They are interested in hiring..  What?  Someone to make them feel better about themselves.  Mmmmm.  Yeeeees.  I seeee.  You must be right.  Mmmmmm.  Big eyes.  Of course.  Yes.  You are so clever.  Oh no, I dind't know that.  Sure.  Of course.  Yes sir.  Yes sir.  Three bags sir.  Of course.  Yes god.  I worship you almighty Ashley.  Of course my Lord and Saviour.</p>

                                    <p>Oh, what's the problem?  You think that I think that I know everything and other people don't have anything to teach me.  But then you think that I don't know anytihng and I won't ask for help.  I ask for help and the problem is that I need help.  I don't ask for help and the problem is that I don't ask for help.  The problem is that...  Yeah.  The problem mis the toxic environment.  The problem is the person-environment mis-match.  Right..  So then it would be great if I could be placed with other peple who I fit with.  No?  It's more fun if I am forced to be with Mrs Pilcher and Ashby and Howe...  It would be better if I was in an environment I wa sa better fit with.  I guess the inspector people and the piont of the PTA testing and the like was to identify people who might do well in private school?  See about academic scholarships and the like?  Instead of me having advance placemetn classes with Mrs Ussher wehre I learn to write my name really large in block capitals and we talk about our use of color.  Toxic environment.  For sure.</p>

                                    <p>Why didn't my mother take me out, then?  Put me in private school?  She could have afforded it.  Well...  Why would you think they would treat the kids any  better?  Do we treat our international studnets any better than we treat the local scum?  No.  We do not.  They just take the money nd scummy scam them over just the same, so far as I can tell.  I don't see them working on honesty or integrity.  Even if you pay the bribes I don't see any readson to think that will help.  I mean to say..  The Univeriteis havecolleceed up how much money for keeping me (while refusing to acknoweldge my qualifiations now) for how long?  I don't think that the money is serving the purpose of having them sign off on the studnets...  Apparently I'm supposed to be dead.  That's the trouble or the problem.  Once I've stopped earning them money then I'm supposed to die now.  Noo....  I'm a slave to the courts?  I can file and file and file and file and file.. So the judges can pick and choose the bits that they like from what I say and write that into their judgement and people can do 'oh me oh my quite the eloquence of Lord Denning!'  ist hat he idea/l now?  Do you like the things I say now?  Now that that seems to be what the ideaology for me is.  That I can just have all my stuff approopriated by others.  Alll of the money and power and glory and rewards for htem and theirs forever and ever and ever amen.!!!</p>

                                    <p>The right to be forgotten..  I see..  We forgot that we had PhD graduates when we gave Lord Ashley his Professorship.  We forgot we had people who had done the work for a PhD before we gave him his Professorship.  That's right Lord Ashley had the right to have everyody else forgotten so that there's nothign left to be done but sing the praises of Lord Ashley.  At least the University of Auckland doesnt' need to wait for studnets to apply, now, before recording that they are enrolled in Lord Ashley's Degree Programme.  They can invoice the Government for them keeping however many studnets enrolled in that programme (what's to stop them enrolling the entire population of NZ in that programme and them collecting up more and more and more money for recording the reenrolment nd rereenrollment and rerereenrollment in that programme).  They could just say that teh entire population of NZ doesn't have the willingness or ability to do anything anything Ashley says when he says because he says.  They all failed the programme they were enrolled in.  They had been voluntarily consented to having been enrolled in.  All voluntary-like.  Unemployable therefore.  Don't worry they have the right to be forgotten.  Non-person.  NO passports or birth certificates.  Didn't you know that the Doctor was it?  Ashley? Maybe Lord Ashley can simply choose to change your assigned gender at birth?  They get to choose your assigned gender now, didn't  you know?  Of course, they were always exercising that power.  Dr Leeks and all that.  They wanted the boys to be pimped out as girls for the people who were that way inclined.  That way they didn't have to worry about them being inpregnated, I suppose.  Before they realised or leaned there was more money in the harvesting of foetal tissue and organs and entire people, really.  I would imagine or suppose.  That way you dont' even need to pay them.  Right?  You can wait for them to pay you with the proceeds of their crimes.</p>

                                    <p>I mean, here's an idea...  If the trouble with my research is that the politicans are psychopaths, really, so you need to intentionally make your research seem like a meaningless waste of time (make your applications seem indistinguishable from the outputs of the post-modernist essay generator in order to receive research funding at all) then tell me that.  Say, hey, instead of working on things in philosophy of psychiatry why not working in something in merology or metphysics?  Write about types and tokens and functions and get it done very quickly before anybody discovers you have a social conscience'.  Yeah.  Too late.  Cat out of bag.  Now off to the gas chamber with you, already...  Well, if they need people to be psychopaths..  Then maybe they will wnat to hear that good is evil and justice is injustice nad privacy is telling everyone your slaves are disabled incapacitated mad bad wicked stupid black women impoverished unclass degenerates.  See, up is down and in is out and left is right and garbage garbage garbge.  I fell on my head repeatedly over the last year or two or three.  Didnt' you know?  Must have.  The speak english all fell out.  Absolutely.  My work is clearly teh outputs of the postmodernist essay generator and Lord Ashley is soooo clever at reading teleprompts.  Don't worry..  You don't get made Lord by doing your job (the job for which you are paid) rather, it's all very very very very personall.  Because they saw into the heart of his soul the very heart of his being and once they heard him read the teleprompt they decided that their complete duty was to totally forget about everybody else.</p>

                                    <p>They publically published selection criterion for the purposes of their accountabilty.  ANd they choose to proclaim to the world that they are not making decisions in accordacne with their published algorithm dnt ehy are not being accountble for the decicsions they are making.  They are making the decisions on personal grounds.  They are not behaving or acting with ny honesty or integrity or fairness at all.  There is nohting in NZ.  No healath system no education no judiciary.  There is nothing.  They refuse to allow there to be anytyhing.  I guess trying to breed slave degenerates for the first world.  Our government won't seem to allow things to be any other way.  There is no alternative.</p>

                                    <p>So, hahahahaha that there would actually be any help for the kids who are having a hard time.  For the people in environments they don't mesh or gel or fit with.  There won't be any counselling or psychiatry.  Of, if there is, I can already tell that the only people who the government will allow to work with the likes of me will be Pilcher and Ashby and Howe.  Once it is identified that certain people are able to help certain other people then they must be removed.  Every time.  Because the aim or the purpose or the goal was to teach me from a very very very young age that I did not fit, I did not belong, all of the everything for for other people other people other people.  I stood out like a sore thumb (I was a f*cking child) and it's never stopped.  Right?  That was my MOther's lot in life as well -- right?  I don't know...  Why wasn't there a job for her?  She started nursing training...  Look at all the degenerates they intentionally choose to hire to give babies away and murder babies and the like...  Why she wasn't able to complete her nursing training and go on and into and do that... Why there was no job for her.  No employment for her, in NZ.  Why the other mohters were so horrible to her.  Such a f*cking b*tch.  Why they would say 'stop worrying about looking so pretty and *ride*' when they actually were being paid to teach me...  Why they never would teach me anything...  Don't worry about her, she'll be okay...  When actually something was off about my posture and I needed some genuine help.  They didn't know.  Okay.  Other people did.  But those other people are never allowed to help me...  Right?</p>

                                    <p>Whenever I did work well with someone in the  healtlh system they left.  I don't know that they applied to leave or they were re-deployed.  SO that f*cking bad fit people would be forced to work with me.  I guess it's about how you get people to shut up about things.  If you don't wnt Professor Glue's Professional Glue Factory to Turn your Brain to Glue then you learn to shut the f*ck up and stay the hell away.  There is no Psychiatry in NZ.  Only treat the involuntary nonvoluntry.  Leading the volunteers off to the gas chambers all voluntary.  How you have to treat people to get them volunteering for their suicide progrmme.  What a f*cking farce.  Not even trying.  Won't even allow people to tray.  Not trying to develop.  Not developing.  Throwing the applications away.  Throwing the applications awway.  Everybody else had the right to be forgotten. All of the everything fro Dr Leeks.  All of the monuments and awards in his honor.  He gets to choose the next generation and train tehm.  All nd only Dr Leeks 2.0 will ever be cknowledged as having applied.  What a f*cking joke of a farce-land.</p>

                                    <p>I wrote my MA at the University of Waikato when I was doing DBT.  Dialectical Behavior Therapy.  It was a new treatment for psychology in NZ.  It was being run as a pilot trial, actually.  In order to qualify for DBT (pilot trial) you needed to be diagnosed with 'Borderline Personality Disorder'.  If you did notn quality for DBT then the treatment you were offered was:  Nothing.  No treatment, at all.  The control group.  Nothing.  The only way to (possibly potentially actually) have psychotherapy, in NZ, in the proximity of a 'teaching clinic' (Univesrity of Waikato had a Clinical Psychology Training Programme) was to be:  Firstly:  Diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder.  Otherwise, you only had the standard Cognitive Behavior Therapy.  FOr anxiety or depression.  You needed to be sick (you are not sick enough) not too sick (you are in hospital therefore too sick) not sick enoguh (you are out of hospital therefore not sick enough). To, uh, learn about how 'activity scheduling' (aka act your way into feeling different.  Smile.  that's what happy means.) And fixing your cognitive distortions (tell me what you think?  Bad!  Wrong!  Tell yourself 'I loves me' in the mirror 5x per day therefore everything A:  OK!)...  So, uh, in order to get 'revolutionary' treatmetn from NZ...  Borderline Personality Disorder.  Hmmm.  Really?  To get treatemtn this is what I must do?  To get to talk to a psychotherapist in NZ?  Really?</p>

                                    <p>Firstly..  Self Harm.  You need to have documented that.  Really?  To get treatment?  To be considered bad enough?  (Now I realise I had it lucky.  Many were told they needed to have a court order from having being accused of crimes.  Many were told they needed to have been actually imprisoned and they would get help or treatment they themselves were asking for, they knew they needed...  Only if they were imprisoned of a crime..  At which point they were told they wouldn't quality until release...  I see now.  The great lie...  The great lie..  Anyway..  In the basis of this information...  I cut / burned myself.  To present evidence of how much I wanted treatment.  I mean...  Yeah.  That's the truth of it.  What I was thinking at the time.  Maybe DBT would be the treatment that would help me...  Cope with teh Mrs Pilcher and Ashby and Howes of this world.  (Since Miss Dobbs and Rosemergy and Ussher were not really allowed to work with me...)  Various other people had set their sights...</p>

                                    <p>Yeah.  So.  I would really like to be able to help the little-me's out there...  Not just me.. I know from AA and NA and so on...  Often (sometimes at least) people with history..  Use their position to incessantly recount their history in ways that are also not helpful.  But I wanted to be an alternative.  For the people who were helped my me.  Where I would refer on (and not try and keep) people who needed to be matched with someone else (it's notn personal).</p>

                                    <p>I sort of got to do DBT.  Firstly they put me in the control group.  Told me I was 'treatment as usual or normal'.  I presented the letter from the DHB saying no treatment was going to be offered to me.  I said that was unethica.  They were refusing treatment to people in the control group.  There was international evidence that DBT was effective.  They were effectively torturing people placed in control group.  They said they didn't have the resources to offer 1 year of the program.  They could offer 9 months only (1 academic year) and I would be treated by someone in training who was only there for 1 academic year.  I did that and it was really helpful.  Then at the end of 9 months I was told I was working with someone else that they chose to employ full time...</p>

                                    <p>I was not a good fit or match with the person they chose to hire full time.  A recent graduate of Otago.  I got on very well with the studnet in training (I learned subsequently she was a PhD history Graduate there was no job in history so she transferred into clinical psychology)...  She was older...  Probably ideally would have been history academic.  But no jobs.  We fit quite well.  Narrative sort of therapy allowed within the DBT scope.  Anyway..  New hire.. Recent graduate from Otago..  She was...  She was pretty.  She was young.  She was trying to be presenting herself as clever and pretty and bubbly and fun and likeable..  Maybe to be a sister??  I needed someone with the strength to handle things that I wasn't strong enough to be able to cope or deal with.  I didn't need social pressure to be a happy face for her and help her feel even better about her being paid however much she was paid with her shiny new job as Clinical Psychologist for the DHB.  It was not a good fit.  It was not a good fit.  It was not a good fit.  It wasn't personal...  But it was a fact..  And there wasn't anybody else.  Because they choose to under-staff.  Because they chose to staff for the masses or majority and they don't have an eye to requirements of a significnt class of outliers or similar.  Anyway...  She ended up writing in my notes something to the effect of she couldn't help me therefore she recommended nobody help me.  No treatment.  Treatment only makes me worse.  Cut me from service entirely.  So then I did try and kill myself.  No hope, you see.</p>

                                    <p>I see that now she's very very very very high up in teh administration.  Psychology for the prisons, even.  I suppose because of her willingness, now, subsequently, since, to write people up as 'I can't help them (not a good match) therefore I recommend no help for them'.  That is or means to say they keep her on payroll to write up how nobody should have any psychological treatment can't treat don't treat.  So the governmetn pays her how much?  To withhold psychology treatment services for people held in prisons nd psych instituions.  While telling others that they are not sick or bad enough for treatment.  See?  See?  See how it is not allowed to work?  It doesn't work?  It won't work?  </p>

                                    <p>I do have empathy for her...  But we were not a good fit.  It really wasn't personal.  I didn't need her to harden up...  Be a mean bitch or anything.  But she was how old?  Picked young young young and they trained her up the way they did and she's..  I don't know what she is now.  Well, I do.  Paid a lot of money to write up how they don't need to pay anybody other than her to write up reports about how no psychology treatment for anybody.  They only need to opay her (in the name of psychology) and they never need pay any other psychologist.  The entire psychology budget for her to withhold treatment for everybody!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

                                    <p>See, when you read something like 'Brave New World' and you understand that NZ basically does the experiments that the ethics boards of everywhere else couldn't approve (and the bar on what the ethics boards approve everywhere in the world really couldn't be much of any lower...)...  You are supposed to..  What?  Empathise with the story-teller? But why do that?  You want to be an alpha baby.  Right?  You think that in a land like this... You could pass yourself off as an alpha baby.  Right?  That's all it means to be an alpha baby in that kind or sort of land.  To read the tele-prompt that would be given to an alpha baby and then not deviate from that script.  Right?  Most desirable state of affairs.  Who keeps the scripts?  Anything anything anything anything.  Yes sir.  Yes sir.  Three bags full, sir.  NOt sure who Ahley Bloomfield's wife is.  Who is gunning for him, clearly . The way that Chris Hipkins Mummy is gunning for him...</p>

                                    <p>After a health scare in Auckland Central..  People flee to the long arm of medical care...  Indeed.  How to get the people to disperse to lands where there are no doctors.  Where there are no schools.  Where there are no roads.  No social services.  No expecttions of social services.  No employment... NO jobs.  NOthing nothing nothing at all.  It isn't like there are social services for the people on the payroll.  On the payroll only to ensure and enforce no delivery of any of the social services.  No  healthcare.  No justice.  Nothing.  Nothing.  NOthing.  NOthing.  NOthing.  Nada.  Zip.  Zilch.  Zero.  Nothing nothing nothing.  Nothing nothing.  Nothing to be seen.. NOthing nohting nothing at all...</p>

                                    <p>Rawgh.  I mighty psychologist!  I get paid 9xFTE position to write 9x patient notes.  I say in patient notes 'I in my clinical psychology opinion reccommend no psychology treatment for you'.  Then I can collect 9x psychology job moneies for delivery of no treatment.  That's in your best interests.  9x FTE psychology positions for me.  No treatement for you.  But what's in it for the NZ Government?  I know...  We pay you for 6x FTE Psychology positions to 'handle' or 'manage' 9x the caseload.  But why stop there?  Why not pay you 3x the standard for 9x the caseload?  But why stop there?  Why you not pay the university pay the university pay the university record levels of debt against your name only while you handle 9x the FTE psychology caseload?  How could we be more pscyhoptic?  True question.  Really...  Further or future research will tells us...  How can we be mooooooore psychopathic..??  Only game in town...</p>

                                    <p>Well..  I know.  The entire country should RIP because Lord God Almighty Saviour Judge on HIgh Ashley shall take Allllllllll of the moneies for the FTE Of the entire nation!!!! That's just brilliant!! Everyone else can just be recorded by the NZ government as owing the NZ government moneies for having been all voluntary-life volunteered by the Government for being enrolled in the course of how to be Lord Almighty God and Saviour Ashley Bloomfield course in the 2 year Masters of Everything qualification!!! Graduation ceremony scheduled for never!! Oh my!!! What a lark!!!</p>

                                    <p>I imagine that it's a truly glorious day!!  When the elite esteemed leaders of NZ can take visitors from Harvard or elite esteemed political positions in the US or the UK, the King of England, and show them the kumara patch that the allow the Maaori of Northland to grow in the lands up there.  So they can get pats on the back and told 'well done'  and 'that's the only reason why we acknowledge you as almighty God leader of NZ'.  Keep up the state of no work!</p>

                                    <p>Then the northern hemisphere will have a destination where to send the proceeds of crime investors to.  The leaders of gangs and the like.  THey can pay bribe bribe bribe money and maybe even supply 20 14 year old finance student virgins to NZ in exchange for.. . Doesn't matter what... I mean, you don't have to honor your contracts when you chose to do business only with degenerate criminals -- right?  When you break your promise.. What are they going to do? Bomb Christchurch?  You are welcome.  Bring it on...</p>

                                    <p>I mean, let's put it this way (to help people make informed investment decision)...  Has ANY STUDENT EVER paid the University of Waikato more money than I did?  For all the years the recorded me as being enrolled (for all the years they sent invoices to the NZ Government for keeping me enrolled).  I am wondering whether any University of NZ has ever in the entire history of the University got soooooooo much money from the NZ government for keeping a single studnet enrolled.  Ever?  Ever.  Has any University in NZ ever made so much money ever before as what the University of Waikato made off of me?</p>

                                    <p>What do we call this?  The money cow.  I do  believe.  I am quite the money cow.  Right?  And the only way I can repay my debt is my untimely slaughter.  Because I am money cow.  Right?</p>

                                    <p>Wah wah wah wah wah we have no medical doctors, no psychitrists.  Only 1 clincal psychologist to write 'reccomend: No treatment therefore pay me money'.  Quite the..  Brain drain..  Taster the brain...  Concentration camp extermination chamber to anyone with brain...  The nature of the brain drain.  All the brains go down the drains.  Look see at our native planation of the food-stuffs almighty god visitors from overseas.  Check-see the state of our governnce!!! must have!!!</p>

                                    <p>Oh, and then how many years of work?  How much money how much money how much money?  How many EFTS of money should go to the University for 1 EFTS of work?  For 3 EFTS of work for 4 EFTS of work?  How much money?  How much money?  How much money?  And how many years of labor was that?  How many weeks of labor?  How many weeks of labor?  HOw many weeks of labor?  Hey...  I know.. Only people proclalimed stupid and incopmetent imeciles psychopathic mad stupid f*cking retards poor weak incompetent imbecels wards of the state will be reenrolled and renrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled..  That is the fate of the entire population of NZ -- right?  But why stop there?  Rolli tout to Australasia -- right?  But why stop there/  Roll it out to Northern America -- right?  But why stop there?  Why stop>  Why Stop>  Why stop>  Just keep keeping slaves never pay tem take their work..  NEver stop praising the almighty god of ashley nobody else was eligible to apply nobodoy else applied noody else has a phd any teaching experience any research.  Only game in town.  Never stop never stop never stop paying the nz gvoernment from the proceeds of your crimes.  Never stop never stop never stop.. There's nothing here.  </p>

                                    <p>Private Psychiatry???  It doesn't many any sense.  Psychiatry.  'Psychiatry' is a means or mechanism for the Government to record you as mad, bad, degenerate, incapacitated, incompentent, not fit etc etc etc.  Nobody would voluntarily sign up for help or assistance.  Nobody would voluntarily sign their kids up for school or education or anything either, though, however.  For similar samey reasons.  There's nothing here...  It isnt' abuot public  / private.  theres imply nothin ghere, at all..</p>

                                    <p>Hmm... I can't decide.  Do I want a kid to be bullied to death by the likes of Pilcher, Ashby, Howe and company...  Or the likes of Uffindel.  What private school should I send my kid to, then, to be bullied to death?</p>

                                    <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/us-canada/300776843/new-york-state-approves-composting-of-human-bodies  Well, that's great.  Of course it isn't about the weathly people who get to choose that they want to be composted instead of having an entire mausoleum pyramid to the gods in tehir honor.. It's about the people in prisons or state care institutions and the aborted foetuses (who aren't to be used in cosmetics or similar) the ones that don't make their way into the food chain of the 'hospitals' or 'prisons' more overtly can be fed into the hospital or prison food chains a little more (but not much) roundaboutly.  The value of a life.  Right?  Apparenlty  if homo sapiens is not signed off as having been enculturated properly then it's just another animal.  Right?</p>
