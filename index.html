                Could have been worse.  They could have locked her in a hospital room, druggged her with who knows what, and refused to call the police or give her a line out to police.  They could simply tresspass anyone who presents for treatment (unless it is a politician, of course) and then they wouldn't need to hire any 'doctors' or 'nurses' or anything, really, anything at all.  </p>

                <p>The Ministry of Social Development has informed the court that 'justice no essential need' and now, one year after a substantive hearing of the issue, the social security appeals authority still has not overturned this declaration from or by the government.  The entire panel of 1+1 has refused to overturn the statement of fact.</p>

                <p>Not even trying a little bit.  Are they?</p>
