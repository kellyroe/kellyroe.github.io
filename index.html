                        <div class="container">

                            <p>The financial losses that the 'Universities' are reporting are becauase of building depreciation on their studnet slums, correct?  The building is supposed to last for 50 years, is it?  Or 100 years?  So divide the cost of the building over the lifespan of the building and you hemorrhage money.  I'm pretty sure that was what the Health Management guy said, from Otago, about how the Canterbury people could be sure to cry cry cry cry cry cry cry about how much money they were losing, every year, such that they could not would not pay clinical staff to work clinical jobs.</p>

                            <p>They need to look into who is on staff who is 65 or over.  Start with stopping their payrolls.  Time for them to go.  What proportion of people on payroll are 65 or over, would you think?  I actually don't know.  But once you have done that then you have a better idea of what (if anything) is left...  Then...  The Education and Training Act says that the primary function of a University is Research.  If you want to know more about it, ask AUT.  When they transitioned from being a Tech to a University there was much opposition from the other 'Universities'.  So the question of what the difference was (such that AUT could or could not claim to be one) was something that was extensively considered.  The focus was on research.  AUT employed a bunch of researchers, I thought.  E.g., the Millenium Campus and so on...  Segregated them from the teaching aspect...  Physically...  Culturally...  But employ a bunch of researchers they did.  So that they could claim research output.</p>

                            <p>It does not matter what the Statues of NZ have to say regarding the Education and Training Act.  The Tertiary Education Commission.  They simply will not perform their statutory functions.  Won't do it.  It doesn't matter what the laws are.  The courts have made that clear.  The Supreme Court doesn't think it is a matter of public interest.  I guess by that they can only mean 'it is in fact something that is not in the public interest'.  They seem to think (The Supreme Court) that their job is to throw out of court any complaint about things that are not in the publics interest.  Their job is to find against the interests of the public.  What judiciary?  They don't seem to understand their basic function.  Purpose.  How old are they?  Time to get out...</p>

                            <p>Anyway..  Refusing to teach.  They already got rid of NCEA latin.  So nobody studying NZ curriculum could do Latin at tertiary level, ever again.  Killed it.  THey are trying to kill maths.  Languages.  Everything.  Break out the melamine for the gamma babies.  THe parents and grandparents and great grandparents have decided they don't want to retire.  They would rather eat you and keep their salaries until they die.  But they have also made choices that they have made about the state of aged care, who works in it, whether they are paid, the lack of informed consents and the euthanasia drugs..  THey wouldn't have things any other way.</p>

                           

                            <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/programmes/news-extras/story/2018893905/rnz-editorial-audit  I don't know what this is about.  But I am pretty sure that RNZ declared Russia's actions to be unlawful or illegal before the trial had even properly got underway.  Is that a common thing?  The police tell the newspapers that they have caught the criminal and so then guilty until proven innocent?  But never will be.  Either you voluntarily sign the confession else we will get a psychiatrist to say that you are psychotic.  If a jury doesn't find that convincing they can explain about intermittent psychosis that only occurs when juries aren't watching.  Maybe wait until the maximum sentance time has elapsed before even scheduling a case management conference...  What judiciary, eh?  I am surprised that the focus is on stories being edited pro-Russia (apparently) when what was striking, to me, was the presumption of guilt before a trial.  In fact..  Pretty sure I read from some newspaper source that the initiating event was Ukraine shooting down a plane.  In what or whose airspace?  That becomes important.  For obvious reasons, I would have thought.  Anyway...  This is just a red herring...  What we want is to pack up our chlidren and ship them off to Ukraine to go die, right Chris?  So that you can keep being payrolled until you die.  Right?  105 and you can still be payrolled for your government job.  Is the plan to go back to workign for the MInistry after you are done being an elected representative?  Why would you give up working for a Ministry in order to become an elected representative?  I guess he wasn't elected by the people.  The people voted and then there was a bait-and-switch.  Voted for Jacinda, and got Chris.  Where is Jacinda?  Maybe Chris Hipkins ate her.  Maybe she's being kept in his basement?  Why isn't anybody worried abotu where she is??? </p>

                            <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/better-business/132380608/the-experienced-skipper-who-navigates-the-odd-ridiculous-question  Jacinda Ardern.  There she is. </p>

                            <p>Here is an invoice from the University of Waikato (that was charged to my Studnet Loan):  file:///Users/kelly/Documents/GitHub/kellyroe.github.io/writing/invoice.pdf</p>

                            <p>Things to note about that invoice:</p>

                            <p>(1)  I didn't apply to do a Philosophy Thesis with the University of Waikato in 2019, at all.  I applied to 120 points 1 EFT PHIL0800 MPhil Thesis with enrolment dates 05-03-2018 - 03-03-2019.  I wrote them a thesis in 2018 and submitted it in September 2018.  They refused to send it out.  October 2018.  They sent the MPhil out for 'doctoral examination'.  Then, in response to examiners reports:  January 2019.  They refused to send that out.  February 2019.  They refused to send that out.</p>

                            <p>(2).  120 points = 0.5 EFTS for PHILO800 Philosophy MPhil Thesis 2019.  </p>

                            <p>(3).  60 points = 0.5 EFTS for PHIL0800 Philosophy MPhil Thesis 2019 5 months of enrolment. </p>

                            <p>(3). 20 points = 0.1667 EFTS for PHIL0800 Philosophy MPhil Thesis 2019 2 months of enrolment.  </p>

                            <p>What does the Tertiary Education Commission say about how Universities are required to report their Stats if they want government funding and if they want to invoice to Student Loans?  They must report them 3 ways.  120 points = 1 EFT = 34 weeks of enrolment including the examination period.  It doesn't say that 120 points = 0.5 EFTS = 60 points = being detained indefinately under the zero fees scheme.  It doesn't say that you can enrol students in programmes of study that they never applied to be enrolled in.  Particularly when they have done the work for the qualification, already.  If you scroll through to page 3 you see that they say tuition feees are owing but will be paid by the NZ Government under 'PhD examination fee waiver (domestic).  I wasn't enrolled in a PhD.  THey had no business sending my 120 point MPhil thesis out for PhD examination in 2018.  They had no business double-billing 2 lots of PhD examination (one in 2018 and then another again in 2019) when I only applied to be enrolled in a 120 point 1 EFT MPhil Degree that should have been completed in time to have enrolled in a different progamme of study (Medicine) in 2019.  I didn't need my grades to be finalised because the MPhil is ungraded the grades were from my Honors Year.  They agreed to use my grades that had already been locked in (then proceeded to refuse to accept the GPA when calculated according to their algorithm) and refused to examine my thesis for the qualification I applied to be enrolled in.</p>

                            <p>This is a letter they got their lawyer to send me:  https://kellyroe.github.io/writing/fees.pdf  Focus on the part that says 'From the 1st July and during the examination period we will keep you fully enrolled under zero fees...'  What part of the zero fees scheme was to apply to graduate research students?  The TEC makes it clear that the enrolment period (for which fees are paid) includes study breaks and examination periods.</p>

                            <p>Neil Quigley (Vice Chancellor of the University of Waikato) does mathematics:</p>

                            <p>https://kellyroe.github.io/writing/squigley.pdf</p>

                            <p>External examiners are paid differently whether they are examining a Masters Thesis or a Doctoral Thesis.  I have the examiners packs that were sent to the examiners that assert this.  I don't know how much money was transferred from the University of Waikato into Caroline Mason's bank account: https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/arts/contact-us/people/carolyn-mason.html (she was one of the external examiners) to know whether she and the Canadian one were paid to examine a Doctoral or Masters thesis (twice)...  But they were provided with cover-pages for their reports that were headed 'doctoral examination'.  I mean to say whether they were paid to examine it as a masters or doctoral thesis the cover-page for their 2018 reports of the thesis made it clear that they were examinining it with respect to acceptability as a doctoral thesis.  Why?  Because no external examiner is going to say that 50,000 words is enough for a PhD.  And the Univesrity of Waikato wanted moooooooore mooooooney.</p>

                            <p>Take Quigley to China with you when you go over there with a trade delegation, Chris Hipkins.  Take him so he can be accountable for how he is billing the 'students'.  I think you will find that they are not keeping accurate records of student enrolments.  Forcing re-enrolment and more and more and more and more fees to be paid because Quigley is a f*cking psychopath.</p>

                            <p>How old is Caroline Mason ffs...  Is she over the age of 65 yet?  Time to retire Caroline.  Get the f*ck out.  Where is all your studnets research then, eh?  All the research outputs you've supervised to timely completion?  Yeah, right. </p>

                            <p>Is Kim Sterelny still on payroll at the Australian National University?  How old is he?  </p>

                            <p>How old was the former speaker of the house sent off to be diplomat of Ireland?</p>
                            
                            <p>How old was Justice Toogood?  Pulled out of retirement to hear Roe v University of Waikato and not see anything wrong with the way they are double billing for studnets, recording enrolments in programmes of study never applied for etc etc etc.</p>

                            <p>NZ was the only place that didn't seem to have any problems with China keeping people in prison camps in the name of training and education.  Can we think hypothetically?  IF this and that sort of thing is going on THEN is that okay?  New Zealand said:  Not any different from anything we are trying to do.  Doing in fact.</p>

                            <p>To be clear.  The US says that you need to have graduated from one of their approved medical schools within 5 years to apply for registration to practice in the US.  Auckland and Otago are currently listed as approved.  I informed them that those are the only 2 Medical Schools in NZ and they are not processing applications to enrol properly.  They are also not processing graduations properly.  E.g., Harlene Hayes was VC at Otago when they decided to withhold graduation from studnets who had internships signed off because they didn't want to pay them to work in the hospitals (when they could have them continue to pay the 'University') and when they did not want to allow them to get away (e.g., by passing USMLE examinations and having employment options overseas).  I asked them if I could sit the examinations without having gone to Medical School.  I can purchase study materials (USMLE books, World Question Bank, etc) and register if and only if I was found competent by their examination process.  They said 'no'.  Which shows you that they don't care about competency.  It's just a money making scummy scam.  I wonder if they even grade the thing properly, at all.  I guess the idea is that you pay money to go to Harvard or wherever because they will give you more direectly the answers that you need to spout in that particular year.  Not even trying to be fair,  hey.</p>

                            <p>Have to wait for various people to die before there will be a job for me, apparently.  They wouldn't have it any other way.  F*cking hurry up and die, then.  I'm sick and f*cking tired of waiting for you to die, then.  Now you want to say I'm too old to have a job at all.  While you are over 65 and still on payroll.  You are supposed to retire at 65.  Many of them have been on government payroll since 20 if not before.  More than 45 years of governmetn payroll and they were too f*cking stupid to plan for their retirement?  GET OUT!!!!!  F*CKING GET OUT!!!!!!!!  GET OUT!!!!!</p>

                            <p>What education and training system?  F*cking psychopaths.  GET OUT!!!!</p>

                            <p>Take the trade delegation to China and explain to them how much money they should pay NZ 'Universities' for education in this country when NZ 'Universities' don't acknowledge their own qualifications 5 years post-graduation.  They think that the value of an education is that it is obsolete 5 years post-graduation.  Factor that in to the cost of the qualification.  That the entire qualification wont be acknowledged even by them, in 5 years.  So say the people over the age of 65 who won't get out.  Busy trying to undermine the Universities entirely by replacing tertiary education curriculum contents with secondary contents with primary contents with no education and training system at all.  There isn't anything there.  </p>

                            <p>Take Chris Whelan with you too.  How old his he?  Take him with you to China so he can explain that what Waikato is doing isnt' anything different from other of the NZ 'Universities' and he doesn't see anything wrong.  Maybe take the Ombudsman as well.  How he can't see anything wrong.  Hell, take Justice Toogood.  </p>

                            <p>It doesn't seem very plausible that Jacinda Ardern chose to walk away from a couple hundred thousand dollars per year in order to be unemployed.  I would think it more likely that text to speech AI got good enough to give an interview of script-bot output that sounded indistinguishable from the real Jacinda (insfoar as there is such a thing) than that anybody, really, would voluntarily walk away from that much money.  You should be grateful when the people voluntarily elect you are their elected Prime Minister?  HOw should you show your gratitude Jacinda?  I would think it more likely Apple made a bot-Avatar of Jacinda reading the script-bot response than that she would voluntarily resign from being Prime Minister.  She really seemed to thrive and flourish on being the centre of attention.  I don't think she would have voluntarily given that up.  That seems unlike her.  Where is she?  Taken into US custody, or is she somewhere else?  Where is Nieve?  She'd be in school now, right?  Where in the world is Nieve in school?  At least we have the Minister of Everything to show us the state of the maths books that may or may not go to the kids up north.  That's a suitable education packet for them, he thinks.  I guess so they can grow up learning about negative numbers and doing Squigley stats.  Can't even keep accurate enrolment records.  Must be something wrong with my math.  Yeah, right.</p>
