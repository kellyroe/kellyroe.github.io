                             <p>I am file re-formatting my work and organising it into yearly increments.  E.g., </p>

                             <p>
                              <a href="./writing/ks.png">Here is an example of an email from Kim Sterelny (who will not write me a reference).</a> 

                              I collated the 'few small chunks' as he refers to them, here:
                              </p>

                            <p>The teaching temporary register</p>

                            <p>We'll keep a list of people who want to teach in the schools.  It's important for the government to match supply and demand so that the government does not have to pay the teachers.  They can simply phone someone on the wait list and offer them 1 days work.  Say that someone called in sick.  Just do all of the employments like that.  Just phone people up from the temporary register.  Turns out that you can get people turning up to do a days teaching work (so to speak) without even being paid for it.  Especially if you are willing to cast your net wider.  Recruit from people fresh out of prison in the name of second chances, and so on.</p>

                            <p>Then you can assess for all the non-verbal important skills like whether the temp worker will turn a blind eye to kids smoking or taking drugs in the bathrooms.  If that's okay maybe the teachers smoking or taking drugs in teh  bathrooms.  If that's okay maybe the teachers drugging the kids in the bathrooms.  If that's okay..  Well, we see how we recruit for all the qualities we value.  Don't even have to pay anybody to work that job, it turns out!  They'll do anything anything anything!</p>

                            <p>The nursing temporary register</p>

                            <p>I'm sure you see how this is going.  Ring ring.  We need someone to come in to work today.  There's some injections in that room over there and some patients over there.  They've all been consented to have the injections.  I think it's an immunisation, or something?  Off you go...</p>

                            <p>Hospitality</p>

                            <p>Not sure how well you will fit in.  Hey, we have someone call in sick.  Can you come in for the evening?  A trial.  Yeah..  Just come in for the evening and we'll see how things go..  We think someone might be leaving next week, so a spot for a permenent will  become available...</p>

                            <p>Ghosted.</p>

                            <p>Let's just keep lists of temporary so we can pull from the list of temporary only.  Never pay anybody to work that job. Just pull from the list of temporary only.</p>

                            <p>Would you like to move to NZL?  We have a shorage of skilled workers.  By which we mean, quite simply, that we don't want to pay anybody to do skilled work.  We would rather keep wait lists of people who will come and volunteer their time pretending to work the job.  That's why we provide Shortland Street as a major export to the world.  It's a little role play so people can see roughly kind of sort of how they are expected to conduct themselves in the healtlhcare situation.  So that we will never need to pay the workers.  No shortage of people volunteering for free auditions.  Who wants to play doctors and nurses?</p>

                            <p>Would you like to play university acadaemic?  We can get the second year students teaching the first year studnets.  Let's have a mooting thing where the second year studnets can play being judges.  Turns out we don't need to pay anyone.</p>

                            <p>I'm sure there is no shortage of people over the age of 65 wanting to play at various things.  You don't have to pay them.  They've taken more than 45 years of highly paid government payroll for themselves already.  They have nothing to lose.  Right Justice Toogood?  What's the worst that can happen?  Removal from office?  You aren't supposed to be in office.  You are supposed to be retired.  Do they pay the assistant or associate who gets to follow you around the nation when you go on tour?  Gets to complete you or your judgment or something from various hotel rooms?  Is that how it works?  How it doesn't work?  How it is that you simply can't see anything wrong?</p>

                            <p>The (likely fake) news says that Ashley Bloomfield was appointed Professor of Public Health (or similar) with Auckland University.  He never applied to do PhD or MD so far as I know.  He never did the work for either of those research qualifiations.  He hasn't done doctoral level work for 3 years.  He hasn't got a research output.  Why don't you pay someone who did the work to become professor to be professor?  Why do you hire the least qualified person for the job?  What University?  What hospital?  What school?  What judicary?  There's nothing there.</p>

                            <p>I did not see ANY student (any doctoral studnet) from the ANU with reports from external examiners.  Variosu said that they were told that the externals accepted their work without any changes or anything.  That's not plausible.  You can always say 'read just one more thing' or 'reference just one more thing'.  Or 'swap the position of chapters 2 and 3 around because I said'.  Or, 'I have written this thing, reference my thing'.  Or 'I found a typo!' etc.  It's not plausible that external examiners don't find 1 thing to pick at in a piece that's abou 100,000 words long to be written in 2-3 years. </p>

                            <p>I did not see ANY student do a public oral defence.  Nobody did one.  I would have attended -- but there weren't any to attend.  They weren't having their studnets work examined.</p>

                            <p>I never saw anybody (any PhD graduate studnet, any recent PhD graduate) in an ANU academic gown.  No graduations.  I didn't see anybody with pictures or conferred degree certificates.  Unlikely that people wouldnt have been having them framed etc.   </p>

                            <p>There is nothing there, hey.</p>

                            <p>Martin Davies and Kim Sterelny refused to write me references when they were my named supervisors.  They wouldn't do it.  What am I supposed to do in the face of that?  Offer to suck their dicks?  Slip them a hundred dollars?  What the  hell?  I did the work..  What the hell..</p>

                            <p>Did they write other people references?  I guess they did.  Other students of the ANU were given paid positions.</p>

                            <p>Were they?  Or is that a hoax, too?</p>

                            <p>What education and training system?  Not even trying to be fair at all.   There's nothing there.</p>

                            <p>What's that?  Ashley didn't consult the Bill of Rights.  I guess that's why they paid him more than half a million dollars per year.  To not consult the Bill of Rights.  What are his sons doing now?  With everything they learned about how Daddy Dearest gets paid more than half a million dollars per year to pretend to be too f*cking stupid to follow the laws.  So say the judges hauled out of retirement for precisely that occasion.  What a f*cking joke, mate.  Did Daddy dearest do your population health assignments for you?  I guess you'll never have to do them.  Arrange for Daddy dearest to be detained in some f*cking dungeon somewhere and split quarter a million per year for yourselves.  What a f*cking farce of a f*ckign joke of a f*cking hoax of a f*cking scam.  Stupidest city state in the whole f*ckign world.  I f*cking swear.  There's nothing here.  FFs.  Too f*cking stupid to live I tell you waht.</p>
