            <p>Have I done enough for paid employment yet?  What do the external examiners have to say?  Oh, you haven't gotten around to sending my work out yet.  Yeah, right.  What education and training system?  They pay Sterelny (past the age of 65) to be sooooo hostile and soooo competitive.  Sooooo comeptitive to undermine it all.  There isn't anything there.  Why did they even pay him?  He didn't do any teaching at all.  It had one job to do in fact (it takes the thesis and it gets it out to external examiners).  I mean, it could help make the thesis better since it's being paid to supervise.  But the most f*cking minimal thing that it could possibly do is to take the work and get it to externals.  There isn't anything there.</p>

            <p>They won't process complaints of wrongdoing.  There isn't anything there.  What education and training system?  What health system?  Detention prison camps and f*cking slavers.  Stanford Prison Camp Experiment.  The social construction of the prevention and prohibition of social development.  There's nothing there.</p>

            <p>They tell me (employees paid to advise prospective medical students) that I have to complete a new qualification from a NZ University to be eligible for enrolment in MBChB.  </p>

            <p>They tell them that they take PhD graduates and enrol them in Australian Universities to study medicine.  But not New Zealanders.  We aren't eligible for their HEX scam.  New Zealand Univeristies will enrol Australians claiming debt against their name while they put them to playschool passing themselves off as doctors in our hospitals while they pay and pay and pay and pay the `university'.</p>

            <p>They refuse to follow the laws.  The laws say that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible to be enrolled in qualifications they have applied to.  But they won't enrol them in qualifications they have applied to.  WOrse -- they enrol them in qualifications they have not applied to.  I did not apply to study anything at all with University of Waikato in 2019 but they have recorded levels of debt against my name for more fees when I never even applied to be enrolled with that institution.</p>

            <p>The laws say that NZ citizens are entitled to a free secondary education until they turn 20.  So they enrol them in tertiary institutions and record levels of debt against their name from when they are...  AUT was saying they had a 14 year old finance studnet from Vietnam enrolled with their institution.  What education and training system?  There isn't anything there.</p>

            <p>They put the `students' to unpaid labor doing all of the work while they don't even pay them.  They record more and more and more debt against their  name only.  Forcing them to live in student slum accommodation or Professors houses.  The first year students output more research (each one of them individually) than people who are paid to be Professors.  They won't get their studnets work out for external examination.  They hand it over to Professors from the northern hemisphere to pass of as research outputs of their own or their own studnets.  THey don't have oral defences because of all these doctoral qualifications they handed out to people who didn't even do the research they attribute to them.  They can't even explain it.  You can tell in a conversation with them.  Which is why they won't discuss academics.  Party party party it's compulsory it's important for your education to go away on camping trips!  What education and training system.  There isn't anything there.</p>

            <p>Prison detention camps.  Have I done enough for paid employment yet?</p>

            <p>The Office of the Ombudsman and the Privacy Commission are supposed to be NGO's.  THey are supposed to employ the most qualified person for the postion.  They advertise positions of all levels from most senior to most junior.  From permanent positions (where people can actually plan for a future) and it's only temporary positions for 3 or 2 or only 1 year.  I'm not qualified enough for any of that to even be offered an interview.  Yeah, right.</p>

            <p>There is nothing there.  Prison death camps.  CHristopher Whelan has not processed a single complaint of wrongdoing against the `universities' of NZ since he was appointed into his position of office in 2014.  We are supposed to believe that nobody is willing or able to process a complaint of wrongdoing so that they need to pay him quarter of a million dollars per  year.  Nobody else could possibly work that job.  It's too f*cking hard for  them to say `supply me with the evidence of wrongdoing so I can forward it to the police.  It is then up to that whether and when the government prosecutes the wrongdoing within the education and training system.</p>

            <p>They are keeping hostages.  Detention camps.  Prison camps.  A PhD is supposed to take 3-4 years only with 2 years minimum and up to 1 year of external examination.  THey won't get the work out to externals.  They won't do it.  There is not an education and training system there.  So, then, who do they payroll?  People who had their own theses go out for external examination?  They had publically scheduled oral defences?  When?  How come I have NEVER SEEN A SINGLE ONE.  All the seminars and talks that I've been to over however many years and I HAVE  NEVER SEEN A SINGLE PUBLICALLY SCHEDULED ORAL DEFENCE OF A DOCTORAL CANDIDATE.  There arent any doctors.  It is where the `best and the brightest' go off to die.  There is f*cking nothing there.</p>

            <p>They are dissolving or disestablishing the schools, now.  Start by merging the secondary schools with the primary schools and then make everybody apply for their old jobs with the restructure.  Then get people enrolled in primary school teachign qualifications only to do all of the teaching work while they pay and pay and pay and pay the university for their training scam.  Dissolve the polytech's and get the people who were previously on payroll to teach at tech to be re re re re re enrolled with the `university' so they can pay and pay and pay and pay and pay to be put to work passing themselves off as employees of the medical training programme.  Then get studnets (preferably from overseas) to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay to be enrolled in medical school so they can pay and pay and pay and pay to pass themselves off as doctors or nurses or healthcare assistants.  Maybe cleaners.  They will need to have a several decades long qualification in that and a decade at least long internship programme where they do all of the work while increasing levels of debt are recorded against their name only.</p>

            <p>There isn't anything there.</p>

            <p>Everybody knows the only reason they are forced to go to school is to hand their lunch money over to the bullies.  There isn't anything there.</p>

            <p>They are saying now they want pre pre pre pre pre testing on the pre tests for the pre testing of pre tests.  The various people on payroll would never pass the pre tests for the pre testing they would never pass the test to have their work be externally examined for NCEA or anything else.  Pay and pay and pay and pay the Cambridge Curriculum people.   Yeah, right.  If every kid gave $80 USD to Harvard as part of an application fee just think of how many libraries etc etc they could build.  How many people (sorry, `people') to be payrolled to be soooooo hostile and soooooo competitive.  To be abusive psychopaths to undermine the whole thing.  What education and training system?  People are supposed to pay and pay and pay money to Harvard to be taught by Jacinda, now?  Did she apply to do a doctorate then?  SHe did the work for that then?  Oh, she's thinking about writing a book one day.  Well, good for her.  Maybe write a book every f*ckign year for 7 years plus and then...  Well, when it's time to pay you it's time for you to die.  Right?  There isn't anything there.  F*cking death camps.</p>

            <p>They keep false IRD records saying that I owe them money for being enrolled with the University of Waikato in 2019.  But I never applied to be enrolled with that University in 2019.  There isn't a University.  They won't get the work out to externals.  They send it out to be externally examined for the wrong qualification.  When the only external examiner based outside NZ requests an oral defence be scheduled they keep false transcripts recording that the student failed to complete the qualification (because they wouldn't get the work out, they wouldn't get the work out for the qualification teh student applied to, because they wouldn't schedule an oral defence,  because they wouldn't get the updated thesis back to the external with sign off papers).  What University?  They don't have any graduates.  I mean, they will graduate people at the end of hteir third year and fourth year to make up numbers.  But where are all the PhD graduates?  Oh, they must have a different ceremony on another day.  The ANU doesn't have doctoral graduation ceremonies so far as I could see.  I never saw anybod in an ANU doctoral gown.  I never saw anybody give an oral defence.  What University? Prison slave detention camp.  Sterelny is sooooo hostile and soooo competitive.  There's nothing there.</p>

            <p>So, how are all these people on payroll, then?  How is Nick Southwood and Rachel Brown on ANU payroll as lecturers and researchers for the ANU when neither of them have reports from external examiners insofar as I know anything about it at all.  Neither of them had publically scheduled oral defences of their PhD where the external examiners asked them questions etc.  How is it that they are regarded to be graduates of the PhD Programme?  How are they on payroll?  What University?  HOw is it that they didnt' wear teh fancy gowns around University House?  How is it that I don't know of any PhD or doctoral functions or celebrations being held at University House?  All the time that I was there...  So many years in excess of what is required for them to get my work out to externals and they won't do it.  Ooooooh have I don't enough!  I'm sooooo worried that I haven't done enough!  Maybe I should cry and cry and cry for more and more and more extensions.  Sterelny is worried that I haven't done enough for PhD.  See what he regards to be a `few small chunks'.  F*cking psychopaths.  There isn't anything there. </p>

            <p>Macquarie University won't acknoweldge receipt of my applications to them.  I applied for a Post-Doctoral Fellowship when I was enrolled with the doctoral programme at the ANU and when it was time for Australia to pay me.  And they wouldn't even acknowledge receipt of my application.  They subcontract lecturing work to me so that Jeanette can spend her ARC fellowship grant on herself, presumably.  Instead of paying a post-doc to do research she subcontracts teaching to people who they won't get their work out to external examiners.  There isn't a University there.  They won't pay anybody to do the work.  Psychopaths on payroll. Bullying and abusive. </p>

            <p>How many years was Dave Wall kept re re re re enrolled in doctoral qualification before he was sent to hospital to nearly be killed by administering thimene before dextrose sending him into a coma.  How many years did he work  before his thesis went out for external examination?  HOw many years does he get to be tortured by Daniel Stoljar `I'm just going to have to stop you right there.  What do you meeeeeeeean by first key word of sentance one?  I just don't understand what you meeeeeeeeean.  No, you can't give a talk.  I don't have anything to say.  I'm not giving a talk.  You can't have anything to say.'</p>

            <p>How many decades was Carl Brusse kept re re re re re enrolled.  What happened to the first lot of thesis work that he wrote?  Did they give it to people from Princeton to pass off as their own?  Maybe someone soooo f*cking stupid that they were incapable of writing a thesis of their own.  Maybe someone on payroll already passed it off as their own.  Like how Fiona MacPhearson just took my work on delusions (that she heard in conferences when she took handouts of the work that I'd done in conferences) and then wrote it up and passed it off as her own.  F*cking psychopaths.  There's nothing there.  DOn't you want to join them?  Well, you would have to pay me.  No f*cking kidding.  You don't do it to associate with the best and brightest that's for sure.  They were all killed off years ago so that Sterelny could be the only game in town.  It's soooo hostile.  It's sooooo comeptitive.  It's sooo hostile and sooo competitive there's actually nothing there.  WE make it to slavery yet?  The f*cking death camps.</p>

            <p>Cry cry cry for nuclear submarines.  Cry cry cry for stallites.  We will need to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the people because they need a few more decades or generations yet to make a vaccine.  Nobody else need apply.  Nobody else was capable of workign that job.  Yeah, right.  What educationa nd training system?  What health system?  Murder.  Death.  Extermination camps.  THey won't get the work to externals.  They won't pay the workers.  THey don't want an educated population.  ANything that is done is done in spite of and despite them.  Certainly not because of them.  They aren't helpful at all they are soooooo f*cking hostile.  Sooooo competitive.  There's nothing there, at all.</p>

            <p>It is a complete and utter fabrication how much money the NZ government says people owe them for their education and training, in NZ. They are not keeping accurate enrolment records.  They give false advise telling people they need to be enrolled in qualifications they don't want to do in order to be eligible to be enrolled in qualiaficaitons they do want to do.  E.g., they enrol peopel in Public Health qualifications when people want to be enrolled in Medicine.  They tell them that they need to do Public Health as a pathway to Medicine.  They record debt against their name for Public Health qualifications when people only enrolled in it becuase they were given bad advice.  People on payroll told me I needed to complete a new qualification from a NZ Unviersity to be `eligible' to study Medicine. That is not what the education and training act says.  It says that since I'm 20 years old I'm eligible to  be enrolled in the qualification I've applied to.  The Univerisities refuse to accept the laws.  I don't know.  Maybe they didn't get anybody to apply for paid employment processing applications to enrol or giving enrolment advice.  The best applicants they had for that paid position weren't willing or able to parse the laws.  Sounds plausible.  Auckland graduate were they?  Or maybe they never got their thesis out for external examination? </p>

            <p>I wrote a 120 point 1 EFT MPhil for Waikato in 2018 because of the wrong advice I was given.  I have ackowledgement from them that they received my application to enrol by the deadline.  THey refuse to enrol me in that qualification and they enrol me in programmes I never applied to with different course codes.  The course codes don't match anything in their University Calendar.  The IRD says that I owe the government fees for the programmes of study they have enrolled me in.  What education and training system?</p>

            <p>They won't get the thesis out for external examination.  120 points = 34 weeks of study including the external examination period. That's what the TEC says.  The TEC decides what teh Uni is allowed to bill student loans for.  But they aren't following the laws.  They won't do it.  They are keeping false enrolment records. </p>

            <p>People owe them nothing.  Nothing.   Nothing at all.  What educationa nd training system?  Slavery prison detention camps.  It's hostile and competitive and they are all trying to bully each other to death.  There isn't anything there.  There is nothing there in fact.  THey won't get the work out to externals.  THey won't allow exernals to sign off.  THey aren't graduating students.  They aren't hiring.  THey seem to be hiring the least qualified and or the people who are not willing and or able to do the job.  THe jobs have statutory definitions of what they are about.  The CE of the NZVCC is supposed to honor international obligations to protect whistleblowers and to process complaints of wrongdoing so as to stop the wrongs.  They won't do it.  Blackbirding for slaves.  Bullying abusers.  Chris Whelan hasn't processed a single complaint of wrongdoing since he was appointed to office in 2014.  That's why they hire him.  To ensure the job isn't done by anybody at all.  We don't have doctors or lawyers or engineers.  We don't have teachers or nurses.  We don't have cleaners.  Sterile supply technicians.  They are being re re re re re enrolled they apy and pay and pay and pay and have more and more and more debt recorded against their name only.  There isn't anything there.  Talk about a false economy.  There is no economy.  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camps.  There is nothing there. </p>

            <p>Dr Leeks.  Most valuable most valued employee.  MOved from NZ to Melbourne and supplied with all of the resources and position that he needed to best facilitate his ongoing crimes.  Everything it is that they value.  Summed up right there.  Nobdody else need apply.  HOw many medical students did Dr Leeks train?  How many did he graduate, do you suppose?  How many did he fail out of the training programme or bully or abuse to death so that he could be the only game in town?  NZ doesn't have psychiatry.  It doesn't have medicine, in fact.  Australasia doesn't have informed consent and so it's just torture and bullying and abuse in the name of medical experimentation.  There isn't anything there.  The peopel on payroll to do the medical experimentation can't even won't even calculate a GPA according to their published selection criterion.  We are supposed to believe that they are doing important medical research?  Wehre are the consent forms?  Oh.  Various people have been volunteered.  They have  been consented.  That's good enough say the only managers and ethicists that they'd employ or deploy into their postions.  There isn't anything there.</p>

            <p>Break out into small groups everybody!  We are doing to be doing clinical skills!  You have been volunteered to be a model for your group this week.  They need to practice filiming every inch of skin looking for changes that might be cancer.  We'll need to do that one regularly.  Maybe take some pictures so we can hopefully see some cancers growing and see which of them kills them.  THen we can do cervical exams.  Do you think you can push the scope far enough up to see inside the abdominal cavity?  Maybe take some endometrial cells with you as you go.  Can you see the ovaries from there?  Then we can do prostate exams.  See if you can feel anything.  Take turns now.  The all important clinical skills. Who wants to work pediatrics?  We have some children who have been volunteered...  How is it supposed to go, exactly?  Oh please explain it to me.  Break into small groups everybody!  Capstone project is getting to practice lobotomies on each other!  We can call it `taking a nasal swab'.  Or maybe we can practice ventillting each other.  That way we don't need to worry about payrolling any doctors.  What doctors?  What doctors do you see?  What education and training system?  DOn't forget to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay so they can do everything they can to train and pay and pay the next Dr Leeks to be everything it is that they value!  What educationa nd training system?  There isn't anything there. </p>

            <p>It's soooo comptetitive!  It's simply astounding how many people want to take cervical samples from newborns.  See if they can infect them with HPV virus, different strains of it, see which of those go to to cause the most aggressive cancers.  See how many can be arranged to have died around when it is time for htem to be paid.  Really set them up for a lifetime of deprivationa nd abuse.  Incase the genetics stuff wasn't enoguh.  In cause the incubator school they were placed in wasn't enoguh.  The aim is to kill them off when it's time to pay them -- right?  Replace them with new ones.  Younger ones.  You do the work now and we will pay you later.  Yeah, right.  How many years of work do you do to make Professor Ashley Bloomfield?  Let's take a look at your research portfolio.  Didn't apply to do MD or PhD didn't do the work for one.  Didn't writ ea thesis.  DOesn't have any research output.  Makes sense that they'd pay and pay and pay him to keep the kiddies re re re re re enrolled in PUblic Health `qualifications'.  It's soooo hostile and soooo comeptitive!  Cyclones and earthquakes and urgency urgency it's an emergency.  Vacate your houses everybody.  Just walk away.  We built the government institutions the slums for you to reside in for the rest of your days.  We want to take the re re re re samples from you to see the effects the cancers we grew in you.  To do our very very very very ebst to kill you.  Have you die all voluntary-like.  Send the hospice workers around.  Have the entire community accept that now it's time for them to be paid it's time for them to die.  That one won't last 6 months.  Get the community to accept it and nobody blinks an eye.  In case the government workers come knock knock knocking on their doors.  Urgency!  Urgency! It's an emergency!  We won't pay our workers and now it's time for you to die!  There's  nothing there.  Hey.  Quite by design.  They won't have things  be any other way.  What Educationa nd training system?  THey won't graduate the students or publically advertise the positions.  They won't pay the workers.  THey won't pay teh workers.</p>

            <p>They claim that individuals owe them a total of billions of un re paid student loans. But the government didn't even pay them minimum waage for all the work they did while they were kept re re re re enrolled.  What education were they provided with?  What training?  Who was payrolled to teach tehm?  What was their level of education?  If you can redeploy Ashley Bloomfield and Jacinda Ardern (she didn't even do an honors year -- correct?) into position as University Academics then it shows that there isn't an education and training system.  SHe wasn't trained to be a university academic.  She's going to write a book one day?  YOu mean she found one from someone in NZ and she's going ot pass that off as her own?  Read the teleprompts until the medical doctors say that it's time for her to go.  Neura-link no work-y no more.  Bye bye cindy.  The implant in your jaw bone triggered to go boom.  What education and training system? Why would they want to remove wisdom teeth before 18?  There's nothign there, hey.  F*cking psychopaths.  There's  nothing there.  What a f*cking joke of a farce of a f*cking scummy scummy scam.  There's nothing there.  Cry cry cry cry cry for people to pay and pay and pay and pay for visa re re re re re processing.  There isn't anything there.</p>

            <p>So all these supposed graduates of the Australian National University.  All these supposed graduates of various of the `Universities' of Australasia...  Where are your reports from external examiners?  When was your scheduled oral defence?  Did you defend your thesis, in person, against questions and queries from the public who came to your publically scheduled oral defence and the external examiners?  Did you?  When?  Or are you still waiting for them to get your thesis out for external examination?  What did the `University' tell you?  That that the externals accepted the thesis without any changes being required (not so much as a typo, not so much as one more reference to be added, not so much as `swap the order of chapters 2 and 3 simply because I don't have anything else to say, and so that was what I said'?  Nothing?  So they pay and they pay and they pay and they pay you to manage the death camps, then.  So that you can bully and abuse your own students into not having their thesis go out.  You can get them living in your basement going into the second or third decade of their re re re re enrolment.  What education and training system?  There isn't anything there.  F*cking scummy hoax of a scummy scam.  Why would anybody go to the Australian National University to study with Kim Sterelny?  It's sooooo hostile and it's sooooo competitive!  One could have simply stayed in Wellington Wellington Wellington Wells if one wanted to be bullied to death.  HOw much did Chiara have to pay Victoria University in International Student fees before they would say she'd done enough to be given a PhD (without it being externally examined and without an oral defence)?  How much extra money did they extort out of her for how many extra years of her handing over more and more and more research output while they bully and abuse and refuse to do the job for which they are paid.</p>

            <p>There is nothing there. </p>

            <p>What could it possibly mean, to have  PhD when that is the process by which they get them?  How do they decide who to hand the qualiications out to?  Quickly quickly quickly get them on payroll so they'll do anything anything anything the administration says when they say else they'll just end them.  Becuase they never should have been appointed into those postions.  There's nothing there, hey, not even trying to be fair.</p>

            <p>When I just start my PhD with the ANU Karen invites me (and only me, actually) to go along to her citizenship ceremony.  Because she was in Australia for 4 years, or more, I guess.  Living in Marian's spare room when she's been kept working and working and working when they won't get her thesis out and they've stopped paying her anything at all.  How long did she have to live in Marian's without having any income in Australia before they would get her work out to externals?  How much in excess of the 4 years maximum?  Anyway, then she's got some Australian Government job (to ensure that any future NZer's have things worse than her, one can only suppose).  And she's given citizenship for how badly they treated her during her PhD re re re re re enrolment.  </p>

            <p>But they change the law just before I start so that there isn't a pathway to citizenship for me.  And I'm living in University House and I'm supposed to be paying them rent, still, once the PhD scholarship stops.  What is the PhD scholarship?  Is it even minimum wage?  Is that how much they give the doctoral students to subsist on?  So I'm supposed to get myself into debt, now, living at University House paying and paying and paying rent when they don't pay me a scholarship, even.  Of course I'm supposed to live in Sterelny's house.  Right?  Indefinately.  Go home and live with my parents.  Sterelny has a big laugh about that.   Ben Fraser living with his parents for however long.  John Matthewson working on his PhD for however long from Wellington.  Re re re re re writing making changes...  In considerable excesss of 4 years.  But the whole thing is just a hoax of a farce of a scummy scam becuase nothing is sent out to externals at all. It's just bullying and abusive is all.  Is all that it is.  How did they decide that those people had `done enough' for them to say they had their PhD?  What did they do that I didn't?  F*ckign psychopaths.  How did you get them all throwing rocks at me, Sterelny?  How did you get them all hating on me?  How did you get them all telling each other and anyone who would listen that I was intellectually handicapped retarded lazy...  What is it that you tell everyone about me?  Sterelny says he's soooo hostile and soooo competitive.  I guess nobody would voluntarily sign up for that Degree.  Why do they pay and pay and pay and pay him?  There' snothing there.  There isn't an education and training system.  Tehre's nothing there.</p>

            <p>Move to Australia, everybody!  Dr Leeks and Kim Sterelny most valuable most valued!  Harlene Hayes.  Last I heard she had some Medical Degree programme they wanted to sign 18 year olds up for.  So they can send them off raping and pillaging the aboriginal communities, one can only suppose, before disappearing them in the mines, or similar.  The death camps.  Most valued most valuable.  Everything it is that they value.</p>

            <p>Look at the choices that they make.  They choose Sterelny.  It's soooo hostile it's sooo comeptitive.  They choose Dr Leeks.  They choose Professor Glue.  They choose to try and blackbird for foreigners and teenagers promising to pay them later.  Then look at the choices they make about who to pay and when and why.  There's nothing there.  They aren't even trying to be fair, at all.  What education and training system?  Sterelny is still on payroll in fact.  Isn't he?  His ANU email address still works, dooesn't it?  His daughter get a sex change and call herself Kim, now?  Is that the basic idea?  SHe'll just keep collecting on the payroll and take work from people enrolled and cross out their names and put her name on it and she won't have any teaching work to be doing.  She can spend her life forcing people away on camping trips.  There's nothing there in fact.  Not even trying ot be fair at all, hey.</p>

            <p>I did my 6 monthly review at the same time as various others in my class who started same time as me.  I did a mid-term when I was supposed to -- else the payroll would have stopped.  Right?  There's something in my file (years late) about how Sterelny thinks I'll be done in 3 months.  It asserts I've given him 50,000 words.  The Adminisntration had a document more than 100,000 words at that point.  They wouldn't get the work out to externals.  So that they coud hire Rachel and Nick and find jobs for...  Everyone except me.  Is that right?  All of the studnets who came before me were (eventually) payrolled in post-doctoral capacity.  Post-doctoral wages.  Then when it comes to me everything stops.  And then various people are bullied into fleeing and they won't graduate anybody at all.  There's nothing there in fact.  They would have things no other way.  Don't you want to join them?  But they don't do anything.  They haven't been developing curriculum thtey haven't been doing much in the way of research (stealing their students work and passing that off).  There's nothing there.  The choices they made.  There's nothign there, hey.</p>
