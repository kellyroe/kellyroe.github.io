                            <p>
                            The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications.  They define a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a> 
                            </p>

                           <p>Australasian Universities believe they are entitled to simply refuse to process or progress students work, however.  Take it to court, they say.  Then the courts refuse to progress filings.   
                            </p>

                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  They aren't progressing the filings.
                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  
                                </p> 

                            <p>
                            It seems to me that the Australian Constition explicitly states that New Zealand is regarded, by them, to be a State of the Federation of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  Australia refuses to honor it's own Constitution. 
                            </p>

                            <p>Here are  <a href="judicial-review/sup-court-waikato.pdf" target="_self"> My Filings </a>to the Supreme Court regarding the University of Waikato    
                            </p>

                            New Zealand:  The Gamma Baby Breeding Programme.  For the Wastrels.  The Degenerate Breeding Programme.  The Detention Camp of the World.  Look at how the New Zealand Government treats the people of NZ (refuses to pay teachers so as to stabotage and undermine the public education system).  Refuses to appoint competent judges (of whatever age).  Look at how NZ treats it's people.  Look at how various other countries treat the people of NZ.  The NZ government won't even stand up for it's own people.  It sells out it's own people.  It won't pay the workers.  It won't train the workers. It won't educate the people.  Gamma baby breeding programme for degenerate wastrels.  It certainly doesn't value the health or the life of the people.  Detention camps.  The schools, hospitals..  Detention camps.  Wasting the people's time.  Wastrels.  Wastrels.  Where are my Univesrity qualifications for the Univesrity work that I did?  Where are my Degrees?  WHere is the pay for the work that I did for the Universities after they were required to have give me Degrees?  Where is justice from the courts?  Wastrel land of slaves.  Volunteers.  Bonded servants.  Wastrels.  That's how the Governmetn chooses to treat the people. Who profits from a terrorist breeding programme?  More power for the central government!  ALl of the guns for the central governmetn and no guns for the people.  The people don't need to protect htemselves against the central Government.  The central governmetn who labels them as wastrels and refuses to process their pay.  Refuses to process their filings.  Refuses to process their work.  Refuses to pay their workers.  Busy breeding people to be like cockroaches to survive nuclear strike.  Wastrel land of New Zealand.
                        </p>

                        <p>The government doesn't want doctors.  They want slaves and bonded servants.  They want people to manage and administrate the detention camps.  The hospoitals and prisons and schools.  The detention camps.  Take the organ and the samples and ship em to where they are supposed to be shippped.  Selling out the health of the people.
                        </p>

                        <p>NZ has two modes on the 'right sized'ness of things (education and work).  Either it's a detention camp.  HOme detention.  Work detention.  School detention.  Stare at the walls people.  If you move the pedophile will get you.  Else it's everything for you.  Allll the work for you.  More work than you can possibly do.  So much work that you can't possibly be held accountable for your failure to do any of it properly.  Course not.
