 <h3>Hello World!</h3> 
                        <div id="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>
                                This is the first major style update of the site.  I have converted my MA Thesis into HTML.  I think I need to upload this in order to check the links. Maybe because I made them absolute rather than relative.  Hopefully this update won't break anything!  Thanks for bearing with me while I am working through readibility issues and figuring out color options. </p>
           
                                <p>You can contact me via the email address: email@kellyroe.org.
                                Yes, you probably read that correctly, 
                                my email address starts with the word "email".
                                I'll let you copy-paste that into whatever email programme you like. 
                                </p>

                                <p>I have been changing the content around a bit.  I not sure if it is beter for me to refrain from commentary and keep this facts-based or not.  I don't know.</p>

                                <p>If there are 3x as many applicants than there are available places in a programme and many more high quality candidates than they are able to train in any particular year...  Then you would expect that, after 6 applications, you would have received a couple offers of place.  Statistically.  Something is very wrong with Medical Student selection in New Zealand.  I suppose it is because their primary objective is selecting people they think will keep quiet about various things that present-day Dr Leeks and Dr Green etc are currently doing in our Hospitals.  That is to say they aren't interested in selecting people who will help them figure out how to do better.  That is to say they have already made up their minds they are working to cover up past and present abuses.</p>

                                <p>I really don't know what the problem is, in New Zealand.  It is really not supposed to be that hard.  I can't even complete an MPhil in the 'normal' or 'standard' time because the Universities in NZ have got it into their heads that students need to work for 1 year BEFORE SUBMITTING A 120 POINT THESIS FOR EXAMINATION.  Since you are required to be enrolled at the end of the examination period that means they have decided (on administration grounds) that there always will be a forced re-enrolment at the end of graduate research qualifications -- otherwise the student will never be granted the qualification.  That is to say things are ALWAYS FORCED BY ADMINSTRATION to run over-time.</p>

                                <p>I say this is a corrupt practice that amounts to slavery or something like it.  And they just do whatever they want whenever they want because they want and the courts will collect up more and more and more money if you try and complain.</p>

                                <p>I don't really know what it is.  Maybe it is that the courts need to collect up evidence of gross injustice for...  How many years?  10 years?  20 years?  A lifetime?  Several lifetimes?  Before they think they are required to intervene.  Is that how justice is, in New Zealand?  That's the level of injustice that is required before the court will intervene (without cash payments into the court from the victim)?  To ensure that others are suitably motivated and inspired NOT TO BRING cases to the courts (without cash payments into the court from the victim)?  Perhaps that is the ideal of 'justice', in New Zealand.  I don't know.</p>

                                <p>It feels like there are magic words, or something, that I am supposed to say -- but I don't know what those are.  Or maybe it is a feeling.  I am supposed to express...  Hopelessness.  Perhaps I am supposed to accept and embrace hopelessness in order for justice to be something that will be looked at.  I suspect it has something to do with my not commanding a mob.  That I haven't brought other people with me into the court room.  That nobody else has been advocating on my behalf.  That is something that does not go down at all well in New Zealand, particularly.  We are very much attracted to the idea of people having mobs in New Zealand.  Largest tribe wins.  But that isn't justice...</p>

                                <p>Thanks for visiting the site.</p>
