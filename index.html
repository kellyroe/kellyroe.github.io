                            The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications.  They define a 120 point program of study (e.g., the 120 point MPhil program of study that I applied to be enrolled in) as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a>.  The Universities of New Zealand believe they are above the laws, however, and the courts agreed.  They believe they are entitled to withhold qualification completions and force re-enrolments in order to collect more momey from the student for re-enrolment and in order to obtain more and more money from the Government or external funders for them keeping the student-slave.  They are not allowing graduate research students to complete their qualifications in timely fashions.  They are forcing continued labor without pay.  They do this with vocational training, also, withholding qualification completions so as to withhold pay.  The New Zealand Government is the major employer.  The New Zealand Government chooses to keep slaves.

                            <p>
                            It is tone deaf (to say the least) for Jacinda Ardern to have accepted an honorary PhD in Law from Harvard (graduating class of '22) given how New Zealand treats it's own domestic and international students.  I don't know if there is a set-up for the Harvard Law PhD class of '22 to have someone to sue for loss of value to their Degree qualification or if the entire cohort of the Harvard Law PhD class of '22 didn't do any course work or readings or attend any lectures or sit any breadth requirement or do any of the things you would expect for a Harvard PhD Programme.

                            The University of Otago (1) refuses to supply applications to some candidates (2) throws away applications from some candidates prior to assessing the application on it's merits (3) collects up disability information prior to selection for purposes of exclusion only (there is no equity pathway for disability).  The High Court of New Zealand has found that there is nothing legally wrong with the public University of Otago choosing to conduct it's business in this manner.  I filed with the Court of Appeal but they refuse to progress my filings because I did not have $7,060 to pay the security for costs amount required by the courts.  The University of Otago chose to require me to bring this to the courts.  The Univesrity of Otago chose not to put things right internally.  The present Univesrsity of Otago Vice Chancellor chooses not to put things right internally.  They believe they are entitlted to select whomever they want for whatever program they want for whatever arbitrary reasons they want.  I post my filings with the Court of Appeal here.  You may want to consider this situation (with the Univesrity of Otago and also with the Courts of New Zealand) very carefully before you decide whether you want to do business with New Zealand:
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  The Justice for the High Court Proceedings was one who seems to have been pulled out of retirement for the occasion.  The government chooses to get judges out of retirement rather than appointing new judges.  I do not know if the judges grand-son or great grand-son was offered a place in a program (or graduation from a program) for his role in the proceedings.  Was offered a reference for his application to Harvard.  Decide for yourself the value of a University of Otago Degree. Otago is a public university of the New Zealand government.  It is not a private university.

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings on grounds that it had already passed judgment on the filings and would not revisit the issue.  They did not think my filings sufficient to show there had been a grotesque injustice in how they handled my filings.  I post them here so you can judge for yourself.

                            The Australian Constition says that New Zealand is a State of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  
                            New Zealand is listed as one of the original states of the federation of Australia.  It states that New Zealand has not been asked to be part of the Commonwealth, and it has not consented, but it is expedient to regard it to be a part of the Commonwealth.  It is declared to be part of the Commonwealth.  There has not been a referendum or whatever needs to happen to alter the constitution to have New Zealand removed from it's status as part of the Constitution of Australia.  As such, I don't see how it is lawful for Australia to require New Zealanders to have Australian Visas.  I don't see how it is lawful for Australia to remove visas and deport New Zealanders anymore than it would be lawful for Australia to remove Australian passport from people from Melborne and refuse to allow them entry to any state outside Victoria.  I don't see how it is lawful for New Zealand to have a separate currency.  The point or purpose of which seems only to be to disguise how low wages are kept, for the majority of New Zealanders.  I don't see how it is lawful for the NZ Government to refuse to hand over Federal tax funding and to refuse to uphold building regulations etc that have been set by the Federal Government of Australia.

                            The Universities of Otago and Auckland are not being fair as to how they are choosing what students to enrol in Medicine.  It wasn't that Dr Leeks (Dr Green etc) happened to slip through a selection criterion or process objectively and fairly applied.  It was that he or they was or were hand-picked or specially chosen for demonstrating all the qualities it is that they value.  I suppose, then, Dr Leeks was transferred to Melborne because that is also what they value over there.  I don't see what else we are supposed to think about that when they harbor him they way they have chosen to.  They are not even trying to be fair.

                            <p>
                            The Universities and courts have broken the social contract.  The Courts have chosen to set precedent that it will cost upwards of $20,000 to take a case against the University to the High Court, and even then they work to delay and obstruct and prohibit and prevent justice.  
                            </p>

                            <p> I put in an application to start another PhD with the ANU last year (since they haven't acknowledged tht I have done enough for a PhD already) to see what would happen with my application.  When I applied I said I was not really interested in starting over from the beginning again, and was more interested in recieving credit for the work I had done for them already.  What seemed fair?  My application was declined.  They don't seem to be making academic decisions on the basis of academic merits. They are getting my student records together to get back to me.  I have documented on this site what work I did in what year of my PhD.  There are seminars on the seminar page (written versions of most and powerpoint presentations of all) and there is written work on the writing page.  Still waiting to hear when my thesis submission date is.  The date when my work gets externally examined to see if I've done enough for an ANU PhD.  My supervisor seems to expect me to have been bullied away from academics entirely. Maybe I shouldn't have declined to house-sit for him that second year.

                            Otago has recently claimed that a reason why graduation was cancelled and we didn't see any research students publically credited with having completed their research qualification was because they received threats of violence from a former student.  It does occur to me 'there is no excuse for threats of violence'.  But it also occurs to me that there is no excuse for how Otago has chosen to treat it's students.  What options are there for students or employees or slaves or volunteers when people who have kept them working or studying do not honor terms and when the courts refuse to uphold the law?

                               <p>
                                The Education and Training Act 2020 and the Education Acts prior to that all stated that domestic adults who had attained the age of 20 years were eligible to  be enrolled in the programme they applied to.  They stated that teenagers (under the age of 20 years) were able to be enrolled by the University only if the University was satisfied that they were able to complete the course.  So, when we hear of a Univerity being satisfied enough that a teenager could complete the course so as to enrol them and take their money and we then hear of the University failing them for their course not only once, but two years in a row, then it really looks like the University has some explaining to do as to how it was that they could not pass the student.  The High Court of Dunedin did not see it that way because the Judges don't seem willing or able to understand justice.

                                The New Zealand Government has chosen to create and impose incentive structures incentivising slavery.  Preventing and prohibiting the development of training systems and skilled labor.

                                There is no 'ethical dilemma'  between 'educational opportunities' on the one hand, and upholding informed consent (treating the patient with dignity), on the other.  This is because you are not teaching students how to perform intimate examinations or surgeries when you are requiring the students perform sexual and physical assaults.  If you don't know the difference between an intimate exam and a physical or sexual assault then you need to stand down.  I didn't properly appreciate that abortion was criminal until 2020.  In practice, they just got someone signing off that the woman would suffer mental distress if she didn't get the abortion she wanted and in that way they were all approved on mental health grounds.   But they were delayed, first, of course, so the teenage boys could get to experience being renegade women's rights warriors or liberators not wanting the word to get out how many abortions they'd done in case their lives were endangered by the anti-abortionists.

                                You may have heard of the 'yay' and 'boo' theory of morality.  Nothing more to moral judgments than 'we like'  or 'we disapprove'.  Well now we have the 'yay' and 'boo' theory of academic achievement.  Degrees (and training places) are granted or withheld on the basis of whatever arbitrary reasons people have.  What are we supposed to think when you give Degrees to people who haven't done any of the associated work and when you withhold Degrees from people who did the associated work.

                                Ms Roe has a criminal record, in New Zealand.  <a href="judicial-review/police.pdf" target="_self"> Here is my version of events.
                                </a>

 The courts said Ms Roe was not eligible for diversion because a mental health nurse is a government worker.  I wonder how many people, in NZ, have been deemed violent offenders because they asked for help from a system where they do not employ the people they are supposed to employ.   I have requested under OIA to know who the psychiatrists are on payroll, where they work in Auckland, and the FTE of their position.  The ADHB claims to not understand the question. They say there aren't any psychiatrists.  They won't acknowledge any qualifications to that effect.  They won't enrol people to train to do that.  They train people to perform unlawful abortions and they don't prosecute them as criminals.  They choose to prosecute Ms Roe for asking to see a psychiatrist (and insisting on not leaving until one arrive).  Ms Roe subsequently stayed away from the health system.  The next time she presented for non-psychiatric help (a physical complaint) they insisted on detaining her (unlawfully) in the name of psychiatry.  Now they send her invoices because she is supposed to pay for the Queens Council they chose to hire to file motion to have her proceedings struck out.  The proceedings were not struck out. But she's supposed to pay Ms Roe is supposed to pay Ms Roe is supposed to pay Ms Roe. Ms Roe must pay.  Ms Roe must pay for the crimes of the ADHB.  Ms Roe must  be the violent offender here.  Never stop paying, Ms Roe.  Pay Ms Roe.  Ailsa Claire earns more than half a million dollard per year and a case against her is thrown out by the courts  because the applicant couldn't pay security for costs as ordered by the judges.  Here are some of the <a href="judicial-review/complaints.pdf" target="_self"> Complaints that people have been making against New Zealand Universities.</a>  Compare the kind of complaints and the kinds of things that have been happening with the kinds of things that have been put right through the courts.   Nothing has been put right through the courts.   

                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I mean, what are the people supposed to do?  Blow up the courts?  What is the solution, here?
                                </p>

                                <p>'Renovations' to New Zealand 'hospitals'.  Like renovations to the 'pit of despair' or the 'rape rack' of the 'primate research laboratory'?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Harlow  It's difficult to find (you may well have to breed specially for the occasion) some psychopaths to do psychiatry in New Zealand.  So motivating and inspiring:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Money  I bet he made a bunch of money enforcing what he believed to be 'normal sexual behavior' on the children who had been arranged to have what they like to call 'botched circumscision'.  So motivating and inspiring.  At least we can understand all the reasons why they refuse to calculate my GPA and offer me a training place (or not) depending on my rank order score.  All the sh*t they tell the Medical Students about how they are special chosen.  All the singing their way off to follow instructions...  New Zealand doesn't have a medical system anymore than it has a judiciary any more than it has anything, anything, anything at all.  Why not give Jacinda an honorary engineering degree so can sign off on all the building openings?  Why not an honorary MD so she can sign off on all the abortion exemptions and fast tracked to being tapped on the shoulder to manage the detention camps in the name of psychiatry.  All the sign offs for wrongful death after wrongful death after sexual violation after wrongful death.  All the wrongful death camps of New Zealand.
