                            <p>

                            Other graduates of the Australian National  University PhD programme might like to show everybody the written comments they received from external examiners before they underwent an oral defence of their doctoral thesis.  For the purposes of establishing that they understood it, thereore might possibly be the author of it, if not for any other reason.  They were supposed to be working independently on their research at an institution whose primary function is research.  Only, they didn't seem to be at all interested in getting any students work out for external examination, in a timely fashion or otherwise, so far as I could see.

                            </p>

                            <p>Is Kim Sterelny still on payroll?  Oh, my.  I'm trying to remember how many years ago it was that people celebrated his 60th.  Only 5 more years to go then it's retirement,  hey.  No more payroll for him.  Time to give someone else a turn.  Yeah, right.  Only over his dead body, apparently.  That's what 'old money' means, now.  All the money for the over 65's on payroll while the next generation all marched off to the prison slave detention camp facilities.  Best be re re re re re enrolled and pay and pay and pay for visa re re re re re processing.  Various over 65's don't feel like retiring any time soon.  Thanks for your generosity giving up your life so that they could have everything they  believe their are entitled to.  Them having all the titles, of course.  Them and their dependents.  Kept dependent.  Are they dead yet?  At least they get the aged care workers they chose to re re re re enroll in their healthcare assistant qualifications, I suppose.  They can do their internship while paying and paying and paying the university and paying and paying and paying for visa re re re re processing so they can do a little anyting anything anything to the over 65's who won't give up their payroll in order to keep their whole harem of dependents.  Are they dead yet?  Oh please God, hurry up.</p> 

                            <p>The only reason grades are supposed to matter is  because of what it is that they are supposed to signify.  For example, if you have 5 per cent per day deducted from handing in something late then if a person has a very high GPA then it tells you they get their work done in a timely fashion.  That's what the high GPA means.  But the government wants to delay things until various people are dead, often.  For example, the government wants to delay various inquiries into government workers abusing their positions of power.  The government wants to delay abuse in state care inquiries.  The government intentionally wants to  hire people who either are not willing or are not able to do high quality work in a timely fashion in order to prevent and prohibit and confuse and delay and obstruct.  There are two ways they can play that. Firstly, they can intentionally hire the least qualified for the position.  Instead of hiring people with the highest GPA they could hire Jacinda's daughter, maybe.  She might get around to finishing 1 weeks work by the time she turns 16?  Perhaps?  Else, they could simply flip the script on the grades.  Instead of throwing the papers up the stairs and assigning them via random allocation they could give the people who didn't do the work the A's and fail everyone who actually did a competent job of it and handed in in by the deadline.  I mean the NZ government can hand out grades however it likes, right?  If the US and England is selling them to the highest bidder..  Those who pay and pay and pay for tutorials with tutors who hand over arbitrary answers to particular questions that will be asked, and so on.  The blatant cheating.  How it was that the VC of Queensland got his daughter a place in the Queensland Medical Programme.  Then, I suppose, you want to say that she wasn't the least competent in her cohort.  If you want to give her honors and prizes you will need to ensure she's surrounded by people less competent than she, only.  The race is on, therefore.</p>

                            <p>I suppose that was Justice Fitzgerald's point.  How much worse than chance things are.  If things were actually random then things would be fairer than they are in fact.  I mean to say, if Maaori are 20 per cent in fact then if things were random then one would expect to see around 20 per cent representation in all the things.  Only, that is not what we see.  Things are worse than random.  So, I guess the point was, that shows there to be an intent.  A force.  A will.  Divine intervention.  Inhumanity.  Whatever you want to call it.  Wickness.  Evil.  An active force.  Preventing and prohibiting.  Confusing and obstructing etc etc.</p>

                            <p>Wah wah wah they go on and on about 'demand' for medical services and so on.  We don't have a health system any more than we have a functioning judiciary.  Not so far as I can see.  Does not matter what any of the laws are when the courts refuse to uphold the laws.  Justice Fitzgerald gave me a discount on costs that I was to pay in virtue of my  being 'technically correct'.  I brought before the courts the technical matter of the University of Auckland acting Ultra Vires refusing to properly process applications to Medicine.  They are not following Statutory Law.  The law says that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 are eligible for enrolment in the programme they have applied for.  The Univesrity refuses to accept this, however.  They declined my application on grounds that I was 'ineligible'.  Justice Fitzgerald did not order or instruct them to process my application properly.  They don't get to throw it away on grounds of ineligibility.  They are required to process it, therefore.  They published a selection criterion involving full time GPA, UMAT / UCAT score, interview score.  They refuse to enter my GPA.  They do not use their published method for calculating my GPA.  They don't get to retrospectively decide my undergraduate GPA.  They simply will not do it.  The courts simply will not order or instruct them to process applications properly.  Justice Fitzgerald did not order them to make a decision within the law.  She did not punish or penalise them for their refusal to follow the law.  How is NZ rule by law?  The judiciary will not uphold the laws of NZL</p>

                            <p>NZ will cry cry cry cry cry that we don't have any doctors so as to lure foreigners to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for visa re re re re processing.  To pay and pay and pay for re re re enrolment in university programmes.  They are not graduating people who have completed the requirements of the programmes.  They cry and cry and cry about how they will not acknowledge any of the skills of people, they will not acknowledge them.  Cry cry cry cry cry for more and more and more money from foreigners therefore.  We don't have any doctors.  We won't graduate any.  We won't ackowledge they have completed the requirements of their qualifiation.  We won't pay them.  New people will pay and pay and pay and pay until it's time for them to go away.  The over 65's don't feel like retiring and there isnt' any payroll for anybody else.  We don't have any people.  What people do you see?  Where is the humanity?  It's inhumane.  There's nothing there.  Cry cry cry cry cry for more and more and more and more money and more and more and more slaves from overseas.  We won't pay the workers.  There's nothing here.</p>
