                                <p>
                                The work that I had done in the Philosophy of Psychopathology was all based on the assumption that the aim was to help people in ways they themselves wanted to be helped rather than engaging in a harmful process of abuse.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                So, for example, I was trying to extend work that had been done on delusions and therapy so as to develop therapy for people with delusions in a way that may be experienced, by them and their families and communities, to be helpful to the person presenting for treatment. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                But if the aim or the point or the purpose is to unlawfully detain (in conditions of torture, even), then you can see a different function for diagnosing and 'treating' of delusions.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                New Zealand has been exposed to Psychiatry.  New Zealand has the idea of it.  Such that people present to GPs or the ED, asking for help from Psychiatry, specifically.  They invisage a combination of excluding medical causes, sometimes prescribing medication, and monitoring the prescriptions in conjunction with regular psychotherapy.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                New Zealand does not appear to have Psychiatry.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                On example of this occurred to me in 2020.
                                I presented to the ED of the Auckland City Hospital seeking treatment for a physical complaint.  Previous injury has resulted in disfigured and numb toes.  I had been walking extensively during lock-down and ended up with nails coming off, bacterial infection, and I was concerned about possible hookworm infestation from walking barefoot in the Domain. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I presented to the ED rather than my GP because, at that time, the media was reporting that GPs did not have PPE and, at that point in time, the EDs were relatively empty.
                                </p>  

                                <p>
                                They mocked my concern about parasites.  They  placed an IV line in my arm and held me in a seclusion room under 'duty of care' for more than 12 hours.  There were extensive cords from medical equipment.  There was no natural light.  There was an LED that was strobing and medical equipment with regular intemittent beeps.  I was not allowed to phone the police or a lawyer.  These sorts of sensory deprivation conditions are likely to induce delusions in most people.   
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                They sectioned me for a 5 day observation hold under the Mental Health Act on grounds they believed me to be delusional.  They required me to take who knows what psychotropic medication and there is no medication that was charted for me, at all.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                After 5 days they gave me a form saying I was to be kept under the Mental Health Act with 'voluntary' status.  They refused to allow me to leave for another few days and they asserted that I was choosing to stay voluntarily in the hospital.  I was not.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                YOu can see that the problem is not that there isn't enough resources for everybody who wants help to have help.  If that was the case they would have been happy to have taken lab samples and sent me home.  Rather, they kept me as an in-patient which cost the tax-payer how much money?  While simultaneously sending away and denying psych assessments to people who presented specifically and particularly requesting psych assessments.  The problem can be seen to be the bullying and abuse.  Only 'treat' the involuntary.  Really teach them a lesson as to what 'Psychiatry' and our 'Health System' is really about.
                                </p>

                                The University of Otago experiments on people giving them Ketamine.  That is a horse-tranqualiser anasthetic that is also a date-rape drug.  The University of Auckland experiments on people giving them hallucinagens (LSD) where hallucinagens have been known to induce sensory symptoms that have been taken by clinicians, then, as evidnece for delusion.  They are, often, not getting consent from experimental subjects before drugging them.  They are, often, not following best prescription practices, they are functioning as laws unto themselves.  Scientists in New Zealand (many of them on government pay-roll as Medical Specialists and / or University researchers) do not think that it is necessary to get informed consent from patients before enrolling them in an observational study, an experimental study, or before 'treating' them with experimental surgeries (for example) or placebos.  They publish their alleged findings in New Zealand Journals (kept from the public  behind pay-wall) and register themselves with New Zealand Medical Councils and New Zealand Organisations because these practices are not acceptable internationally.  They document many of their crimes.  
                                </p>

                                They have very tight control over the people they will allow or acknowledge on ethics committees and boards and they ensure those people are kept with no teeth.  They will comply else they will not have any job at all.  The point or purpose of the ethics screen before they select students into Medicine appears to be to select students unashamedly without a moral sense.

                                The University of Otago Centre for Bio-Ethics Seminars (for example, but also see the Psychology Department) were Video Recorded during my time at Otago so you can see, for yourselves, the sorts of atrocities people were informed about and see, for yourselves, the emotional leakage from atendees so that you can see, for yourselves, the sorts of kinds of attitudes towards such atrocities that are on display from the students and faculty at the University of Otago.  It was particularly disturbing to see people fairly helplessly hanging their heads in shame.  That they were required to hear all about these things and that they were powerless, really, to put a stop to them or do anything about them.

                                Harlene Hayes, herself, was psychology trained.  It is disturbing to know that.  As disturbing as it was to read Stuart McCutcheon's thesis about how the lambs die of starvation every winter.  The thesis that was enough for him to be made PhD and, eventually, appointed head of the University of Auckland.  Reading that thesis helped me understand how and why it was that things felt so very very oppressive at the Univesrity of Auckland for First Years, particularly.  The forced over-crowding.  Herding the people around.  Keeping them moving, moving, moving, moving, moving.  Keeping them in residential halls that were noisy (e.g., construction or nightclubs) to prevent sleep with scheduled 8am classes.  Etc.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                There are a few psychopaths who will not allow anybody else to function.  They refuse to train others and refuse to acknowledge the capacity of others in order to keep their control over everything.  People actually do say 'there are certain people who will need to die before anybody else will be allowed to work that job'.  I have no idea why they pull judges out of retirement to deal with cases rather than appointing new judges.  There really is a generation of tyrants, in New Zealand, who will not much of anything other than themselves.
                                </p>

                                I don't know why Australia wanted Dr Leeks, Harlene Hayes, or Kim Sterlny and his wife who worked in New Zealand Labor History.  I have no idea why on earth Australia wanted those people.  I am glad they are all out of New Zealand,  but I don't know why Australia wanted them, there.  I don't know that Australia is doing much better than New Zealand, given that.  The ideological...  Leakage.  The race to the bottom.  They get the rocks from out of the ground and they had them over.  No design plans for submarines.  No satellites.  No independent recipe for vaccine.  No innovation.  Cry cry cry for hand-outs.  The people cannot function, there...
                                </p>

                                Marc Hauser lost his lab.  He lied and cheated and taught his studnets that lying and cheating was good science.  Kim Sterelny told me it was a sad day because it wasn't like he was doing anything that anybody else wasn't doing.  That was an attitude that the teachers had about Dr Green, in New Zealand.  It was terrible that the courts of New Zealand picked on him, specifically, since he was just doing science the way science is regularly, repeatedly, reliably done, in New Zealand.  That is to say, there isn't science here, at all.  Medical atrocities.

                                I wonder if Jacinda takes a little offering of Native Brains with her to Harvard, from the New Zealand Brain Bank.  I think people within New Zealand are funded to record the head injury suffered in young female athletes.  How does it work, exactly?  Do you pick or point out which athlete, in particular, you want diagnosed with early onset dementia so you can arrange for them to be suicided all voluntary like so you can get their brain and explain to your own kids why they aren't allowed to play that sport else why they are requird to wear helmets?
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Jacinda Ardern should take Chris Whelan with her.  He can do a quality and integrity audit of the 2 year Masters of Leadership that involved a New Zealand Student being picked out to go there and do that.  Is she actually seeing that student graduate?  Or did Harvard decide to 'do an Auckland', shall we call it, demanding an extra year of fees to be paid, maybe arranging for the student to be raped maybe arranging for the student to be detained in the hospital system due to early onset dementia.  Are you going to free the hostages, Jacinda?  Arrange for a little student exchange so the people from Harvard can come and see the rheumatic fever in the wild?  The babies born into syphilis?
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                New Zealand does not have Universities.  We have slave / detention camps.  That is what the Judges of New Zealand have Judged.  Good job for them.  Well done.

                                The Court of Appeal has deemed Roe v University of Otago (and various other cases) abandoned because Ms Roe failed to pay excess of $7,060 security for costs for the case to be heard on appeal.  They refused to see the matter as being of genuine merit.  They refused to dispense with or reduce security for costs.  Here are the submissions that I filed with the court of appeal:
