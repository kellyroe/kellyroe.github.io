 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->

                            <article>

                                <p>The Tertiary Education Commission defines a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  
                            <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a>.  The writing tab shows that the University acknowledged having received my application to enrol in a 120 point MPhil with 05 March 2018 start date by their prescribed deadline.  The TEC approved the qualification as being 'right sized'.  They have the statutory function of approving qualifications and checking that the enrolment period (34 weeks) matches the FTE EFTS (1) also the points value (120).  But the University of Waikato is keeping records showing that they are not billing students in this manner, at all.  Shelley-Slade Gully (their award winning legal counsel) wrote me to explain that the University intended to 'hold me under zero fees' indefinately.  I think the name for that is 'detention camp'.  It is like they've had their eyes poked out.
                            </p>

                            <p>The University of Waikato believes they are entitled to require studnets to work for at least 12 months on their 120 point 1 EFT thesis before undergoing an external examination period of up to 3 months.  Since you are required to be enrolled at the end of the external examination period that means that if the examination period takes 3 months then you are required to be enrolled in and pay fees for an enrolment period of 12 months plus 3 months for a total of 15 months.  They took more than 3 months to examine my MA.  I think they only did examine it because I had already left the country.  But it doesn't stop there.  They believe that if the external examiners say anything about changes needing to be made to the substance (e.g., a reference to be added, a section to be moved around) then they are entitled to require the studnet to re-enrol for an additional 6 months and also undergo another external examination period of up to 3 months.  That means another 9 months added.  Basically forcing the student to repeat the f*cking year.  They say that the outcome of what they like to call 'first examination' is always that the student is required to pay fees for another 9 months.  This is fairly inevitable.  That is to say, they offer the 120 point qualification with the expectation that students will end up working for at least 12 months plus 3 months plus 6 months plus 3 months for a total of 24 months (2 years).  What happens then depends a  bit on the university.  Waikato has this 'option' for the university administration whereby the studnet takes another 2 1/2 months to make minor changes.  Find another reference.  Move a comma.  Etc.  The University administration believe they have discretion to force this -- else they can say the student failed to meet their requirements and the qualification is withheld.  
                            </p>

                            <p>Here is how much the Inland Revenue now says I owe the New Zealand Government for my 'Education' and 'Training' that are not acknowledged because New Zealand qualifications apparently expire 5 years post-graduation (well, not the Judges law degrees, apparently, but my qualifications have expired): 
                            <a href="judicial-review/ird-shot.pdf" target="_self"> $104,663.</a>  You can see, then, that New Zealand does not appear to have functioning Universities, they appear to have detention or forced labor camps.  They won't progress or process academic work (particularly research).  They refuse to get official documents (theses submitted for examination) to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit external examiners signing off on qualification completions.  There is no skilled labor workforce, in New Zealand, because New Zealand has a series or system of forced labor detention camps only.  You pay the University you pay the University you pay the University you pay the University.  Maybe they put you to work as an actor playing the part of a skilled professional.  Then, when you are done paying them, your qualifications are withheld.  They don't print Degrees, I would suppose, because they aren't worth the paper they are not even printed on, anymore.  They have an online records keeping system, now.  Right?  So when someone asks if you completed your qualification they can pretend they never heard of you (unless you pay the University you pay the University you pay the University).  Right?  So they can refuse to supply transcripts to people.  Unless they are murdering wrongful death bringing rapists and the like. I would suppose.  In which case they will write them glowing references because that is what it is that we value.  Right?
                            </p>

                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  They aren't progressing the filings. They are refusing to supply applications, refusing to process applications on their academic merits.  Apparently it isn't a matter of public interest how they pick and choose people to pass themsleves off as 'doctors' in our hospitals.
                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  Demanding me to pay more and more and more money to the courts else they force all my cases aborted, or abandoned.  <a href="judicial-review/sc-eyes.pdf" target="_self"> Here is the Judgement of the Supreme Court that I am attempting to appeal on the grounds that it is manifestly grotesquely unjust. </a>  It is like they have their eyes poked out.  Our highest court does not seem to have the conception of justice, at all.  It was the courts decision to delay Roe v University of Waikato proceedings until AFTER Roe v NZVCC and also until AFTER Roe v University of Auckland.  The Judge for Roe v NZVCC made all kinds of pronouncement in his judgment on the matter of Roe v University of Waikato.  That is to say instead of judging the issue he was supposed to be judging (the inaction of Chris Whelan in his capacity as CE of the NZVCC) he thought he would weigh in on whether or not I had done enough for completion of the MPhil Degree.  Clearly that is a matter of the Judge of a different case to decide!  
                            </p> 

                            <p>
                             <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  The Australian Constitution clearly names New Zealand as a state of Australia.  They say that they don't have to honor the constitution because New Zealand officials did not turn up to various things and they did not consent.  I don't know why Australia would care about consent in that instance.  Did they care about the consent of the Aboriginal people of Australia?  Did they care about consent of people to be immunised or subject to medical treatments or experimentation?  If they want to change the constitution then there is a process for it to be changed.  I think it involves a vote.  But New Zealanders don't get to vote so the Australian Government clearly does not care whether or not the people of New Zealand consent.  New Zealand functions as a detention camp of Australia.  But then, Australia still seems to govern like it is a detention camp of the Northern Hemisphere, so...
                            </p>

                            <p>Here are  <a href="judicial-review/sup-court-waikato.pdf" target="_self"> My Filings </a>to the Supreme Court regarding the University of Waikato    
                            </p>

                            <p>Una Jagose doesn't seem to have the job of instructing Crown Law to prosecute corruption within New Zealand Universities, or within the Judiciary (where judges refuse to accept evidence and where the supreme court punishes people for bringing injustices before the courts).  I suppose that is why they pay her more than half a million dollars to do that job.  They pay her to ensure the job is not done by anyone.  Not by her and not by anybody else.  The fact she is in the job prevents and prohibits the job being filled  by anyone with the willingness and ability to do the job.  It seems there is no evidence that they will accept that would attest to corruption.  None of the invoicing information that I provided (e.g., 0.5 EFTS = 120 points = 60 points = indefinate enrolment).  New Zealand does not appear to have a functioning judiciary.    <p> <a href="judicial-review/crown-law.pdf" target="_self"> Blow off response. </a>  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            <a href="judicial-review/adhbinterlocutory.pdf" target="_self"> My request for permission from the High Court to appeal their decision to award costs against me with respect to the ADHB having chosen to file motion to have my proceedings struck out rather than the ADHB having chosen to stop with involuntarily detaining people in conditions likey amounting to torture. </a>  The High Court declined to grant permission.  New Zealand is not leading the Lake Alice Inquiry.  There would be no inquiry if the leaders of New Zealand had their way.  It is a UN directed or led inquiry.  That is the only reason why it is happening, at all.  The pressure from outside New Zealand on the Government of New Zealand.  The Government of New Zealand would not be inquring into any of it, at all, if it had it's way.  Beligerent.  Dragging the heels.  Always.  How slow can we go?  How low can we go?  The people are not allowed to vote in the Australian Federal Election.  The Supreme Court of New Zealand does not function.  There's nobody home.  Nothing here.

                            (1)  The Ministry of Social Development has however many days that they have to decide whether or not they want to respond to my filings.  They may choose to rest their case on the basis of what their lawyer has filed for them already.  Or they may choose to use even more taxpayers dollars filing more things for the courts.  A court hearing date has been set.  There won't be a physical courtroom so that media and interested members of the public may attend (in accordance with principles of open justice).  Rather, it is, at least, insofar as I understand it, a closed hearing.  I am to appear from my own private residence.  I don't know where the other parties are physically located.  I am supposing it is an actual hearing by an actual judge and that the actual judgment that ensues, at some point, is an actual legal judgment.  But this is New Zealand and the previous minute wasn't signed by any judge at all.  So.  Why would you even bother to hire judges?  What judges?  Does New Zealand even have any judges?  There is a process for appointing judges that is required to be followed.  Right?  But it isn't followed.  So, I don't suppose there actually are any judges, at all.  
                            </p>

                            <p>The issue is that the Supreme Court of New Zealand has upheld the Court of Appeal's decisions to (1) in one instance refuse to accept the evidence that Ms Roe had supplied on multiple occasions attesting to her financial position.  That is to say, they accepted the evidence she supplied in all but 1 case.  The Supreme Court upheld their decision to ignore the evidence she supplied in 1 case only.  Also (2)  The Supreme Court of New Zealand has upheld the Court of Appeal's decisions to (3) require Ms Roe (as a person in receipt of SLP as primary source of income) to pay the usual amount of security for costs.  In their own words 'so as not to give a financially inpecunous appliant an unfair advantage in litigation'.  So, Ms Roe is required to raise the funds for security that they have asked else the cases are forced abandoned.  The Supreme Court does not have the authority to deny a person justice on the basis of their financial position.  So...  I would suppose...  The mechanism, here, is that the Ministry of Social Development should make advance benefit payment available to financially impecunous applicants so that justice is not denied to them on the basis of financial impecunosity.  The Supreme Court chose not to reduce the amount required.  The total amount for Ms Roe's cases is more than $20,000.  Because of decisions that the New Zealand Vice Chancellors Committee and New Zealand Universities have made to refuse to sort things internally which has required Ms Roe to go over their heads, to the courts.  They have had years to sort it out and they won't.  They won't do it.  So someone else needs to make them do it else shut them down.  Remove the people from office who are problematic or else shut the institutions down.  International Students and Domestic Students both need to know that the Universities of New Zealand are not enrolling studnets in Degrees they have applied to.  Are enrolling them in Degrees they never applied to.  Are refusing to arrangae for external examination of their work.  Are refusing to allow studnets to be signed off when they are working to internationally accepted standards.  THey are not graduating studnets who have met requirements for their Degree completions.  They are not functioning or workign as Universities, at all.  THey are keeping false records about studnet enrolment numbers.  They are keeping false transcripts (recording enrolments in qualifications that the studnet never applied to, for example.  Failing to record that a student has completed the requirements of a Degree where the studnet has completed the requirements of the Degree).  Justice was denied to Ms Roe in the High Court Proceedings.  The judges refused to accept or acknowledge relevant evidence that Ms Roe supplied to them (e.g., evidnence of them keeping false records of enrolment dates and invoices) and refused to accept or ackomwledge the half of the Education Act that confers duties, responsibilities, or actual job description to the Universities.  Justice was denied to Ms Roe in the HIgh COurt proceedings.  The inability or unwillingness of the Judges to sort things out at the level of the HIgh Court proceedings necessitates Ms Roe go over their heads.  So now the COurt of APpeal needs to consider the laws and the evidence and find in the interests of justice.  And if htey can't or won't do it then the Supreme Court.  And if they can't or won't do it then the Federal Court of Australia (since it's in teh f*cking constitution that NZ is a state of Australia which means it is in the jurisdiction of the federal courts).  ANd if they won't do it then you look to the international mechanisms that there are.  Because there isn't anything here.  This tin pot stupid little despot does not function.

                            This is how New Zealand ensures there is no health, no justice, no education.  Nothing of any meaning or any value.  There is nothing here.  Just a bunch of stupid f*cking imbicels who have set themselves up as Gods.  At least they get sick and die.  Same as everyone else.  There will be a job for me when they are dead or over their dead bodies, apparently.  Yeah.  The prevention and prohibition of justice, health, anything, anything, anything at all. Pay the courts in bitcoin shall we.  I'll start a kickstarter fund to internationally stream the 'judgements' of the New Zealand Court 'proceedings'.  What a f*cking joke.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            (2)  The Australian National Univesrity has given me a date by which they will respond to this issues that I raised with the Vice Chancellor.  I would prefer informal resolution, if possible.  But I am pretty sick and f*cking tired of people like the VC of the NZVCC using 'informal resolution' as a pre-text for refusing to acknowledge or process or progress issues that have been raised.  My vast experience with officials in New Zealand (the internal process for resolving issues within the Universities of Auckland, Otago, and Waikato) have left me very little faith in the Australian National Univesrity being any different.  I do want to give them a chance, however, and the benefit of the doubt.  But I have no reason to believe them to be any different.  They declined an application from me in 2022.  They took more than 20 days to supply me with a reason for declining the application.  The reason was that I did not supply a writing sample and I did not supply a research proposal.  But I did supply a writing sample and a research proposal.  These things were included in the notes that they supplied me.  Their official policy says you are to complain about enrolment decisions within 20 days.  But they don't supply you with the reason until more than 20 days have passed.  So...  I have little reason to believe them to be trying to develop good laws.  And that isn't the issue.  I did not want to start over with a PhD with them.  The only reason I applied was to see if they were lacking in integrity.  As they seem to be indicating they are, indeed.  They are not processing applications on their academic merits.  They are throwing away applications on irrelevant grounds.  Anyway, I have a deadline from them by when they will respond to my complaints about their refusal to supply supervision to me during my PhD and refusal to arrange for external examinatio of my work in a timely fashion and so on.  Let's see if they are just as garbage as the University of Waikato.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            (3)  People don't know if they have an issue that they need to go to the ED for, or not.  Knowing the answer to that is half the battle.  People often go to a doctor because they don't know if something that is going on for them is a very serious problem or not.  They don't know if a little lump on the surface indicates serious cancer underneath.  They don't know if a bit of pain indicates a major problem or not.  They don't know if they are about to fall into a coma or have a major seizure.  They don't know.  Thats why they go to the ED.  And then the people in the ED get them to write down what their home address is (a proxy for how much money they have / if the government values their life, or their head) and who their GP is (similar) and they make decisions on the basis of that who is worth treating or whatever.  That's the way they decide who gets enrolled in what University Degree.  Home address.  Secondary School Attended.  And the decisions they make about who gets to keep on making the same old decisions for the same old effect.  We don't have hospitals.  That's precisely why we have Shortland Street.
