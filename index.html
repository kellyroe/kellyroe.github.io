                            <p>Here is a brilliant idea for teaching people how to spell.  We can call it a 'revoluntary new treatment designed and developed by the only world leaders NZ would put on their payroll'.  It goes like this...  Instead of having spelling word lists we will have word lists of words spelt incorrectly.  The idea is to put all the common mis-spellings on the spelling list so that people know what to look out for.  They can spend time studying and learning the lists.  They can be assessed, then, for their ability to know a spelling mistake when they see one (but only the ones they've learned).  We can develop a whole field of research where we give special names to each of the spelling errors so that we can demonstrate how well learned we are by naming the errors of others.  Chortle chortle snort.  Nothing shows the value of your education than getting to name the spelling errors of others!  Showing off your educational superiority!  They'll be cuing up for visas to be re re re re re enrolled in that one!  </p>

                            <p>Now we want to carry that over to other things.  Cognitive errors or distortions.  Faulty thinking.  Irrationality.  </p>

                            <p>Where am I going with this?</p>

                            <p>The Medical Curriculum must focus on all the errors and abuses that have been performed or conducted by the only medical doctors that NZ would acknowledge.  Register.  Employ.  We can get the medical studnets studying the activities of Dr Leeks and so on.  Get them spending all their time learning about 'adverse events' and about how if they won't wash their hands just think, then, of how they can grow their business.</p>

                            <p>Well, hey, now, if the only people you'd pay to do ethics say that it's the only ethically acceptable postition then things could be no other way.  In the name of all that is good!</p>

                            <p>It takes the application and it processes it -- in accordance with the Education and Training Act (domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible).  It processes it according to the published selection algorithm, therefore, it inputs the full-time GPA, the interview score, and the UMAT / UCAT.  That's how you make a psychopath -- no?  Then we can study medical errors and crimes against humanity in the name of medical science, all day...</p>

                            <p>It is funny, isn't it?  The people they pay to get on with it, already.  And the people they choose to have studying the atrocities of others, all day.  It's soooo competitive.  It's such a selfish hostile world.  The community must raise my child.  Can't even / won't even get a thesis out for external examination when it is supposed to go out.  When it is supposed to go out?  For how many years is someone supposed to work on a 3 year qualification full time?  For how many years?  ANd you are supposed to retire when?  At 65, wasn't it?  After you had 45 years of government payroll, already.  Enough payroll to support the whole harem.  What's that?  Do the work... And we'll pay you later.  But everybody else is still paying and paying and paying for your crimes.  That's the definition of psychopathy, there.  What a f*cking waste of time.  </p>

                            <p>Aw, what's that, Sterelny?  They don't pay you for the work you do -- they pay you for the work you've already done.  Riiiight.  Sure, they do.  Only over your dead body, right?  They claw the money out of your dead little hands.  Is it dead yet?</p>
