                             <p>I am file re-formatting my work and organising it into yearly increments.  E.g., </p>

                             <p>
                              <a href="./writing/ks.png">Here is an example of an email from Kim Sterelny (who will not write me a reference).</a> 

                              I collated the 'few small chunks' as he refers to them, here:
                              </p>

                                <p>So, one of the perks of being a full time employee of a University is that you can take courses for free.  Without paying.  Who does that?  Seriously...  Who does that?  Do you see Professors enrolled in first year or second year or third year courses?  Of course you don't.  Do you see them doing much in the way of any research, either?  Why would they.  They take all of the money.  THey won't retire once they get to 65.  Why would they retire?  They can tell the kiddies that it's soooo competitive they are required to do anything and everything they say.  Else they won't get their work out for external examination.  They won't write them references.  They can behave as badly as they want and nobody will do anything about it at all.  Who wouldn't want to be Professor.  Right Jacinda?  It's not like you have to spend your time actually squirreled away from the world actually writing a book.  Actually reading and writing.  They'll find you something and cross out the authors name and put yours on it.  Right?  And you can spend all your time flying about the place putting on your party frock being a wing-man for the new Epstein or whatever.  Who wouldn't want to pay and pay and pay to send their kiddies to Harvard so they can party party party with the likes of Jacinda all day?  What University?  How does Jacinda get a Visa to be Professor in the US?  It just doesn't make any sense at all.</p>

                                <p>None of the ANU doctoral candidates had reports from external examiners so far as I could see.  Occasionally people would say that they were told by the ANU that the externals said to accept it without any changes at all.  I don't find it plausible that an external wouldn't find just one more book to be read and referenced.  They couldn't find so much as a single sentence to rearrange.  THere were no oral examinations or publically held oral defences. Were there graduations?  I didn't see any of the doctoral students graduate.  I didn't see any photos of graduation ceremonies.  I didn't see any framed degree certificates  hanging on anybodies wall. The whole thing was just a f*cking hoax -- right?  </p>

                                <p>Of course various people are payrolled in fact.  I suppose Sterelny wrote references for other people.  He just wouldn't write one for me.  I suppose Martin Davies wrote references for other people.  He just wouldn't write one for me.  Good enough to keep re re re re enrolled I was.  They took and they took and they took and they took and they took many many years of writing from me.  Did htey reattribute authorship to others?  I suppose that makes the very best sense of why they are so f*cking  horrible to me now.  Won't acknowledge anything from me at all. F*cking psychopaths.  They weren't hired by any kind of fair process at all.  THey weren't considering applications on their academic merits.  They were throwing the applications away to expedite selection for people who...  Like to party party party with the likes of Epstein, no doubt.  Best do anything anything anything everything everything everything the likes of Sterelny etc etc says.  They can do anything anything anything anything.  F*cking psychopaths.  It's sooooo hostile.  Sooooo competitive.  It' ssoooo f*cking competitive there's actually nothing there, at all.  What University?</p>

                                <p>The University of Waikato doesn't have any research outputs.  Where are all the new theses accepted into their library every year?  All the new books suplied by the researchers employed by the University?  What University?  ffs.  There's nothing there.  Just a f*ckign garbage dump quite by design.  Won't get work out for external examination.</p>

                                <p>All these people on payroll apparently or supposedly with the function of being `academic support staff' to help high quality research be done in a timely fashion.  Who offers to check the work for typographical errors?  Anybody?  What's that?  Their actual function is to prevent and prohibit and bully bully bully.  Waikato told me I needed to get them a hardbound thesis no later than 27 November 2005.  So that's what I did.  I never missed a deadline as an undergrad.  I don't know why they thought I needed to take 2 academic years and 1 summer school to do 1 year's worth of work.  But that's what they advised me to do.  They didn't advise me to apply for doctoral programme and submit for doctoral exam after that amount of time.  That's the quality of their f*cking advise.  Their f*cking supervision.  What supervision?  Here comes D D D D D D D D David Lumsden.  With his extensive research portfolio of..  How many words in 1 year?  FFs.  Why so slow?  Why so f*cking slow?  They pay you by the hour or something?  He did get out once he hit 65.  Didn't need to be prclaimed dead of a heart attack like Alistar Gunn, at least.  With the whole pedophiles in the schools programme.  Party party party out at Alistar's party house anybody???  See why he's head of medical ethics.  Why Waikato wants a medical school.  yeah, right.  There's nothing there.  What University?  Where's your f*cking research output you f*cking idiots?  What University?  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>And of course the ANU isn't any better.  And Harvard just hired Jacinda, alledgedly.  3 fellowships for the book she's going ot have attributed to her.  How did she get a visa to the US?  How is she qualified to be professor?  Where is your research output Jacinda?  For how many years were you working at doctoral level?  What a f*cking joke.</p>

                                <p>There isn't any medicine or any health system or any educaiton system etc etc...  Because nobody actually wants anybody else to live etc.  There's nothing there.  It's just  been taken over by psychopathic bullies and abusers.  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>Go to University to eat lunch with your friends?  To go away on camping trips?  To go skinny dipping with the teenagers expedited quickly quickly domestic adults need not apply.  What Univesrity?  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>What a f*cking joke of a farce of a hoax of a f*cking scummy scummy scam.</p>

                                <p>Of course I know that masses of undergrads are allowed to dress up for graduation and graduate every year.  Mostly only the ones who are staying on being re re re re re enrolled in other qualifications though.  Right?  They aren't graduating people from PhD.  They won't employ anybody with a PhD.  They won't employ anybody who has done the work for one.  Why?  Why do that when you can take the likes of Ashley Bloomfield who, apparently, never applied to do PhD, did not do the work for one.  He has no research output.  Well, then, call him Professor and pay him hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to tell the kiddies that he can do anything anything anything he likes.  The judged reappointed from retirement back onto payroll over the age of 65 won't see anything wrong.  What University?  There's nothing there.</p>
