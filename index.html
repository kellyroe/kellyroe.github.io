                             <p>My CV shows how I end up with the following.  I don't quite know how a University course gets to tell people not to reference, gets to tell people to reference differently from how they reference in fact etc.  No direct quotations.  I see why they tell us to avoid the academic work.  It's obviously taking the piss -- or something.  The very wicked problems of evil (technical terms).  Yeah, right.  Is it true that Ashley Bloomfield was appointed Professor of the 'University' of Auckland?  Without him having applied for, been enrolled in, or done the work for MD or PhD?  Without him having a research output?  Perhaps the idea is to get an undergraduate army handing over all their work to him so he can pick and choose and kludge it together and take credit for it for himself (or his friends) right before he fails the students out.  That seems to be where things are at.

                             <p>For all the graduate student enrolments across various 'Universities' of Australasia...  Where are the research outputs?  50,000 words per year.  Roughly.  WHere is it all?  Who gets credit for it all, then?</p>

                             <p>Apparently we need to distinguish between those who do the work -- and those who are paid to do the work.  Those who do the work -- and those who claim to have done the work.  They don't pay you for work you are going to do.  They pay you for work you have done.  Or work you have stolen.  Like they pay Dr Leeks for being a pedophile they pay people to plagarise.  Seems to be what is valued.</p>
