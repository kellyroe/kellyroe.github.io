                                There is a link to my CV that I have presently under consideration for various things.
                             </p>

                             <p>I will try not to do  anything to break the links.</p>

                             <p>I am file re-formatting my work.  That means the content of the hyperlinks will be replaced by the new file formatted work.</p>

                             <p>I am constructing a newer version of my CV that I will make available from here</p>

                             <p>- This is  because I have managed to locate some more work.</p>

                             <p>- It is also because I can simplify my CV by replacing 4 or 5 or 6 links to individual articles to 1 link to a collection for a year.  That makes it easier to see the consistent work output.  For example: </p>

                             <p>______</p>

                             <p>
                              <a href="./writing/ks.png">Here is an example of an email from Kim Sterelny (who will not write me a reference).</a> 

                              I collated the 'few small chunks' as he refers to them, here:
                              </p> 

                                <p><a href="./publish/2013-rep.pdf">Roe, (2013).  A few small chunks for 2013.</a>
                                </p>

                                <p>It is basically a re-write of my thesis topic, especially for him.  I re-formatted it in Word because he said he wouldn't work with .tex.  You can see how I referenced him in the middle chunk, particularly.  That was his cue to send me emails telling me what I should take out and what I should put in.  Is that how it's supposed to work?  He accepts what he says only?  I suppose that's how it is done?  Sterelny says, Sterelny, thinks, Sterelny believes.  Sterelny can tell me what my original contribution is allowed to be.  He can give it to me and I can copy-paste it into a thesis?  When?  For how many years am I to give him work, or how any years am I to do work for the University (present material at conferences etc) before they bundle it up and get it out to externals for external examination?  What University?</p>

                                <p>For how much time am I expected to arrive to the ANU to work under Sterelny's supervision before I can expect him to get to work, then?  For how long before he invited  me to a supervision meeting?  How many of those did we have in the..  How many years was I kept enrolled at the ANU Kim?  Was it 1 meeting per year or something else?  How many meetings do you count?</p>

                                <p>BEFORE I LEFT AUSTRALIA I sent him this (check his ANU inbox): <a href="./writing\doctoral.pdf"> Over 100,000 words of doctoral thesis.</a> He gave me NO COMMENTS on it.  NO FEEDBACK.  AND HE WOULD NOT SEND IT OUT TO EXTERNALS.  Years later I get my student records from the ANU and there is  note from him asserting that I sent him 50,000 words (only) and it should be done in 3 months (therefore 3 months more money for the Philosophy Programme for keeping me re-enrolled so he gets more money for pretending to supervise me).  If he wanted to see 50,000 words from me (only) he should have asked for my words in 2006.  If he wanted 100,000 words (only) he should have asked for my words as at end of 2007.</p>

<p>I did not see any of the ANU students with reports from external examiners.  I did not see any ANU students give a public oral defence of their thesis in response to the reports from external examiners.  Public oral defences should have been publically advertised.  I simply don't believe that various people had public oral defences without my knowing about them.
</p>

<p>How are other students claiming to have PhD's from the ANU?

<p>
    Let me see their work over their comparable enrolment period.</p>

<p>  I don't understand.  </p>

<p>I guess the idea was that various people really really really really wanted to be philosophy academics.  Sooooo much more than me.  They just loved going along to `work' every day and eating their lunch with their friends.</p>

<p>How does Ashley Bloomfield get hired to be Professor when he never applied to be enrolled in PhD, never wrote a PhD, does not have any research output?  How does Jacinda Ardern get 3 fellowships at Harvard because she wants to write a book.  Why won't they hire someone who has already written a book ffs?  I guess she's a former politician so she can help them figure the logistics of breeding real knock-out babies in NZL to populate their under-ground bolt-holes, or similar.  Only the best and the brightest send their kids to Harvard to eat their lunch with Jacinda, obviously.  What Universities?  There's nothing there.</p>

<p>It's just a delay tactic to delay people from having a payroll.  That's all there is to it.  There's no positive reason to go to University.  There isn't anything there.   </p>

<p>The people they choose to payroll laugh and joke about how it's all about `bums on seats' and about `keeping the bums on the seats' for as many years as possible.  Keeping the low-valued individuals delayed and detained and post-poned.  Keeping them poorly in `Universities'.  Treating them like sh*t, generally.  Sterelny was a singularly unpleasant individual, for example.  It's sooooo competitive.  It's sooooo hostile.  It's sooooo important for my career to go away on camping trips and go along to `University' and pretend to have fun eating and drinking with various people.  That's why we go to University, clearly, so we can go to lunch.  There's nobody home.  Nothing there.  They aren't processing the academic work.  There's nothing there.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

<p>Most of the people on payroll at insittutions whose `primary function is reasearch' don't do any f*cking research.  Where's your research output Ashley?  Where's your research output Jacinda?  You are supposed to be on payroll to..  To, what?  To teach from your research?  What are you going to teach?  Teach the kiddies that if they are appointed leaders in NZ they can do anything anything anything the laws don't apply.   </p>

<p>Chat GPT can make one.  Google.  Just type a sentence into google (maybe one you found) and see who Google tells you to reference.  That's a great idea.  Let's see if people can tell the difference between a computer generated research output and that of a person.  What's that, Sterelny?  If  million monkeys typed for a million years..  Hey, I know, just get all your studnets sending you their work (uploading to Turnitin) else submitting to made-up journals.  Then reattribute authorship to various people already on payroll.  Maybe reattribute a book to Jacinda!  She needs a book to be attributed to her now she's supposedly a research fellow of Harvard!  Better find her one and get busy writing her teleprompts for her lectures.  Or maybe she can just spend all day showcasing fashion gowns and everyone will turn up to eat lunch with her all voluntary-like so she can tell them about how corrupt everything is in NZL and at Harvard etc etc.  There's nothing there.</p>

<p>What University?  There's nothing there.  Just another government institution of abuse.  What a f*cking scummy scummy scam.</p>

<p>All these people over 65 and they won't get out.  They are supposed to stop getting government handout payroll's when they turn 65 and they won't stop paying them.  Various other people (me) expected never to have payroll because these over 65 psychopaths won't give up their camping trips and their lunches etc.  F*cking psychopaths.  Get the f*ck out. </p>

<p>How is anybody claiming to have a PhD from the Australian National University?  There were no reports from external examiners and there were no oral examinations or defences. </p>

<p>The  hiring decisions they make.  The Office of the Ombudsman.  Advertising positions of various levels.  From Principal (e.g., OPCAT) to senior to...  To entry level advisor positions.  Where they are going to train new people, allegedly, or apparently.  I don't get so much as an interview.  I'm genuinely very curious about how I'm not the most qualified applicant for an entry level position of 'advisor'.  I've done the work for...  BA (hons) with a full time GPA in excess of 8.  But maybe I fell on my head since then (unlike the various people over 65 whose qualifications they completed more than 30  years ago still count for them, apparently, it is only mine deemed expired).  I've done the work for a 120 point Masters by research a 360 point doctoral thesis by research.  Another 120 point Masters by research.  I just keep on doing the work..  Just keep doing the work.  Sole applcant for filings for varoius cases of judicial review of administrative action.  I do the work.  Not enough for an entry level position?  I've got how many years of teaching experience.  Small group tutoring.  Team work or group work.  Not enough for an entry level position?  F*cking hell.  Mate.  Not even trying to be a little teeny tiny bit fair, hey.  Alllll of the f*cking money for Sterelny so he can take the kiddies away on camping trips ffs.  He get out his pen and paper ready to do his f*cking job (the job for which he is paid) as supervisor, already?  What University?  So, about NZ trying to do the international stuff..  Not even trying.  I suppose they'll find someone who lacks basic reading and writing and appoint them to be chief advisor for the administration of tribal chieftons.  How old is the present obmudsman?  He 67?  How old was Justice Toogood?  Oh, please.  I don't need a payroll.  Keep giving alllll of the things to you.  Oh, please.  So you can do your wonderful civil servant civil servace thing.  Making things better for the people of NZL one dollar for you at a f*cking time.  Alllll of the money for you.  Allllll of the money for you.  Alllll of the money for you.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

<p>F*cking psychopaths.  There's nothing there.</p>

<p>I have various ideas for research projects.  But of course they will never be funded.  They only want to approve the torture experiments etc etc.  See how many people they can injure and kill and so on.</p>

<p>I was looking into the 'rehabilitation' situation, for example, and the idea seems to be to set things up so the ortho surgeons can hammer nails and so on into people's spines and so on so that they are malaligned.  It's a sensible extension of my research.  How the `normal curves of the spine' are not an aspirational ideal.  Getting some surgeon to hammer the spine into an S bend is...  Well...  Whose brilliant idea was that?  But the textbooks and the training courses etc all distinguish between the `normal' amount of curve that you intentionally train.  You know the speel...  Put your hands between your back and the floor and make sure you train a certain amount of lordosis.  It's presented as an aspirational goal.  Like with horses  you really want to train them to have a nice dip in their back there where the rider sits.  Of course you do.  So you can take MRI's of the spinal alighment and get the spine fusing into that position.  Get money to fix people's spines into that shape.  Set up a whole industry.</p>

<p>And of course you want to get the people doing `tummy time' with their kids.  Get the kink in their neck into it early.  Say that the head and neck lying flat on the floor is a `deformed' position.  You want to get your infants up to alter the structure of the neck and head alighment.  You want to pull their legs out long (force them out long) by putting them onto their bellies so they develop that dip or kink in their lumbar spine.  It's all very normal and natural and ideal.  To put them onto their bellies when they don't have the strength to lift their heads up when they are lying on their backs.  When they don't have the strength to roll onto their side.  Force them onto their tummies when they are not strong enough to get out of that position and that'll get them to tuck their legs up under them and crawl quick quick quick as you can.</p>

<p>The race horses, too.  I mean, come on.  THe idea is to treat your kids like race horses it's all a race it's soooooo competitive.  The dressage training is interesting.  But we don't treat people like that.  What people?  It's soooo competitive.  It's all in spite of and despite and not at all because of.  Anyway...  The point is that the new phrenology has application into the new orthopedics.  And the social construction of mental illness -- well tlhat develops into the social construction of Covid.  Of course.  That was the institutional response.  What Covid being socially constructed means.  Khan Academy has stuff on the social construction of maleria.  It's function.  When it was time to pay the endentured servants for the years they worked the planations.  When it was time for the landowners of virginia and so on to give them a plot to work independnently so they could have a life, as well.  THat was when they decided they'd rather say they died of maleria.  How convenient.  It's pretty strange...  To have disorders or diseases who target fit and healthy people of age when its time fo rthem to be paid to be independent.  INstead of paying them and allowing them a life, as well, they decide to bully them out of existence.  In the name of mental illness or Covid or maleria or whatever.  Injury.  Accident.  `We didn't think they wanted to be paid ha ha he he' and so on.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

<p>_______</p>

<p>I went to the APO last night and...  I don't like Mahler.  I think I just don't like Mahler.</p>

<p>I'm not sure why.  The talk before the performance..  I wanted to like Mahler.  I really really did.  But I did not.  I did not like how I felt.  In response to the music.  I did not like it.  I could think of other pieces I'd rather be listening to...</p>

<p>And then I thought that he was (from the talk before) responding to other work that had been done.  We were played exerpt bits where Mahler seemed to be riffing off of or varying recognisable parts from other composers or whatever.  ANd I thought maybe he was an aquired taste, therefore, and you needed to know or get the references for it to be enjoyable...</p>

<p>And then I got to thinking that it was pompus or pretentious in some way, then.  Taking the piss out of academia, maybe.  Academic music.  Trying to be clever.  Not being particularly good.  Not very musical.  </p>

<p>A lot of it was...  Disorganised.  Of course there was organisation.  I mean to say the violins seemed to be working together and so on.  But each section at odds with or conflict or whatever.  The worst of democracy.  Individualism.  I don't know..  Not very musical.  Not very pleasing to the ear.  Noise.  I don't know...</p>

<p>I suppose it might be something that you have to be in the mood for and I wasn't in the mood for Mahler.  That's the truth of it, I guess.</p>

<p>I don't know why anybody would waste their time practicing that when there are nicer pieces to be practiced and played etc.  I don't know why anybody would schedule that.  Put it on a programme, or whatever.</p>

<p>I think of all the pompus..  The worst of it...  The people who think they are better than everybody else for liking or pretending to like or understand or `get it' or whatever.  It being unfashionable to say 'I don't like it, I don't know if I get it or not but I don't really care to'.  I don't know.  Mahler doesn't have any clothes.  It's not very musical, to my ear.  Mahler sounds like he's the one singing cuckoo to the academic types or sorts or whatever who bray and have very large ears.  The worst of the academia.  You know how it is.  Right Jacinda?   </p>

<p>I wonder why the APO needed to get a CE from the USA.  Why nobody from NZL would get to work that job.  Oh,  yeah, it's because there aren't any people here.  Of course.  </p>

<p>Probably it's fairest to say that I simply wasn't in the mood for it.  Climate.  The climate is changing, or something, I don't know.  Maybe I'm saying the things that people thought about it at the time when people didn't seem to like it.  That was how it was received during his life, or something.  Only that's clearly not true because he was celebrated during his life.  He was paid to do his thing etc etc etc.  So it clearly was celebrated during his life.  It wasn't like it wasn't peformed or publically acknowledged at all.  It wasn't like others were stealing it and passing it off as their own or whatever.</p>

<p>It's not the orchestra's fault.  But I did not much like the music was all.  Not to my taste.</p>

<p>I don't understand why the ANU treated me so badly. I do feel that they did.  Why they did not acnowledge my work etc.  Why Kim was so disparaging to and of me only and always.  He seemed so very determined to teach me some kind of a lesson in how I was garbage.  But was I stuck up, then?  Was I?  Why was it okay for people to treat me so terribly?  Ignoring my work etc?  I really don't understand.  People knew I was doing the work I was doing...  I remember Holly saying it was like I was doing the work of a post-doc when I just arrived at the ANU because I came with work I'd done from my previous Masters...  And maybe that was right.  SInce Waikato kept me for 2 years working on a 120 point research Masters.  So...  Why is it okay for them to treat me like garbage then?  When it comes to hiring people for the paid employment they will hire from overseas before they will hire me.  They'll hire people from Dunedin before hiring me.  They'll hire people from the USA before hiring me.  So that's a liscence then for everyone to treat me like garbage.  Just the worst of the horrible f*cking bullies.  Oh yeah, you made it.  All you people who got picked out to work in philosophy.  Once you're on payroll you never need to do any research.  It's all party party party put on your party frocks and fly about the world having lunch with all your friends.  What philospohy?  There's nothing there.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

<p>I'm trying to think how many years the ANU kept Dave Wall working on his PhD (re-writing things under Daniel Stoljar's supervisoin) before...  He got to the point of being bundled into graduate studnets' car and being taken to Calvary..  So they could feed him sugar before vitamin replacement so he falls into a coma...  He nearly died.  How many years was he handing over work to Daniel Stoljar before they nearly got to kill him at Calvary?  It's soooooooooooo competitive.  That's how competitive it is.  Nearly bullied to death.  For how many years was Daniel taking work from him and not getting it out for external.  That's what the likes of Rachael and Nick had to have happen..  Arrange to happen..  Allow to happen... ?  So they could be the only game in town.  The only people to apply?  The only people who..  Who Daniel would write references for?  Is that the idea?  F*cking psychopaths.  I guess they wouldn't be there otherwise.  And so that's the kind of place that it is, then.  Populated by people who only got there by way of doing that kind or sort of thing.  You made it to Harvard, Jacinda!  Was that because you cheated with the election donations and then took for yourself a Kenney leadership scholarship that was supposed to go to a NZL student to study there and then...  How did you get a fellowship when you hadn't even written a research output?  WHo wants to go to Harvard?  The people who are there who wouldn't be there, otherwise.  Who wants to party party party with the new Epstein etc?  What University?</p>

<p>I think Rachael played in the Orchestra in Canberra.  I don't know if she was part of the Australian group who were performing with the APO..  But I suppose the thought that she might be..  Influenced my..  Appreciation..  Or lack thereof.  For Mahler.  Rgarding Mahler.  Rachel came to see me when I was in Calvary for a bit, there.  How many years had I been giving work to Sterelny before I was in Calvary for a bit, there?  How many years had I been supplying work to the ANU..  Was it time for them to acknowledge my work?  So I'm in Calvary instead.  How..  Convenient.  Then.  For some people.</p>

<p>With friends like these..  Who needs enemeies.  Ben Jeffares..  When I phone him panicked that I've submitted a thesis to Waikato for external examination and THEY WON"T GET IT OUT FOR EXTERNAL EXAMINATION and he says quite cooly 'that's because it's garbage'.  How would he know?  Did someone send it to him to read?  Who the hell is he that he says it is garbage?  He's not an external examiner?  He's a f*cking bully.  That's what he is.  With friends like these -- who needs enemies.</p>

<p>I'm soooooo sad I'm not on payroll to eat my lunch with friends like these.  Who wouldn't be in the positions they were in unless..  What positions might they be?  Well, Ben was previously employed with the Marsden Grant people.  To make sure that Kim Sterelny gets to choose to gets research funding etc etc, I'm sure.  Abusive bullies only.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

<p>When I arrived at the ANU they were the ones who kept going on about psychopath psychopath psychopath psychopath.  John Matthewson said he wasn't in medicine anymore becuase he wasn't a better psychopath.  He wasn't psychopathic enough.  Jenette was ARC research funded to work on psychopathy.  Kim kept going on about psychopaths.  Selfish selfish selfish genes psychopath psychopath been taken over by overtaken by psychopaths.  And of cousre they have to go `there aren't any people left htey were all murdered or exterminated or bullied to death however long ago there's only psychopaths left there's no other way to be'.  Why?  So they pronounce me loser, therefore.  Everybody is playing the same game of trying ot exerminate and eliminate and murder death kill as many others as possible so they can take their stuff.  Of course.  That's the meaning of life!  By the only people they'd philosophy department payroll.  ALong with everywhere else.  Right Quigley?
