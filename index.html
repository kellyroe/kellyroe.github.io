                            <p>It will be interesting to see who they hire for VC of research, University of Waikato.  I see the last one was hired in 2020 and they are looking to replace them, already.  Regression to the mean made it more likely Waikato would rebound in the rankings.  I mean, it couldn't have gone any lower.  Literally. </p>

                            <p>I actually truly and genuinely do not understand why the 'Universities' don't want to acknowledge research output.  If they don't agree with it they can simply acknowledge that it's been done, and otherwise not engage with it.  Else they could actually engage with it and use it as a platform for research of their own.  I genuinely don't understand why they want to be about preventing and prohibiting research from being done.</p>

                            <p>I guess it is about 'there is no alternative'.  They don't want to acknowledge or allow that there were alternatives that were presented.</p>

                            <p>I am disappointed that they didn't interview me for the position.  I think (as I said in my cover letter) that there likely is a lot more research produced from people employed by the university (also by studnets of the university) than they want to acknowledge.  I don't really know what is to be gained by refusing to acknowledge the research that is being done.  The keeping of slaves?  Something like that...  So the aim is oppression and control, then?  Maybe the aim is to keep one of the worst 'universities' in the world.  Is that the plan?  A place for people with no alternative so that they can be treated just horribly.  Is that the grand plan?</p>

                            <p>I don't really understand.  I used to say nice things about my time at Waikato as an undergrad.  There was a lot to like about it.  It's nice to go to a place where the children of the elite don't go.  So you don't have to deal with being expected to bow to them, or whatever.  People were there because they wanted to be there.  Not because of parental expectation or whatever.  People were interesting to talk to.  The academics seemed to care about their teaching.  </p>

                            <p>Then you get to doing research and everything changes.  They try and overload you with low to no paid teaching work and start saying 'garbage garbage garbage rubbish rubbish' about your research output.  Apparently this is because it's soooo competitive with the competitive research funding and so on the supervisors see the students as direct competition and they are interested to elminate them only.  Unless they are dependent on them, of course.  Such that they never have to worry about them working independently, or similar.</p>

                            <p>The 'Universities' of Australasia aren't getting students research work out for external examination.  They are refusing to allow external examiners to sign off on completion of research qualifiations (only if the external examiners believe the research is of high enough quality for the qualification).  They just won't do it.  They are full of excuses about why they won't do it.  The work was too early.  Then the work was too late.  They don't want it externally examined because they have made up their minds internally.  The student didn't house-sit for the supervisor enough.  The studnet did too much house-sitting for the supervisor.  The student didn't go away on enough camping trips.  It's just a f*cking hoax of a f*cking scummy scam is what it is.</p>

                            <p>I can put my research up on this website, however.  Research that was done despite or in spite of (and certainly not because of) people on payroll to supervise me.  The 'Universities' take money from the government to keep me enrolled...  Not just me.  Various other people I could name as well.  People who are producing and who are productive.  Often the people who are producing the most and who are the most productive in fact.  Ones they decide to take and take and take and take the work of without acknowledging, without allowing sign off etc.  Because it's soooo competitive, apparently.  There will be a job for them only over their dead bodies, or something.</p>

                            <p>I can post the research here.  </p>

                            <p>My first research article was on Daniel Dennett's model of personal identity and his model of what was going on in dissociative identity disorder (formerly multiple personality disorder).  I said that there was a tension, here, and I tried to resolve that by being more realist about alters.  This was considered a 'good enough' writing sample for me to be granted funding for an ANU summer research scholarship.</p>

                            <p>My summer research articulated a Wittgenstinean / narrative model of delusions along the lines of Sass (a US clinician).  It was a different model from the one Martin Davies was funded for (a model of delusions as irrationality).  I felt it was more sensitive to clinical practice from clinicians who were providing narrative therapy to people and it was also more humane to sufferers.  This was considered 'good enough' for me to be granted funding for a PhD with the Australian National University.  Not good enough for Professor Davies to write me a reference to do a PhD at any University -- but good enough for Professor Davies to say he would 'put in a good word for you' if I applied to the ANU. </p>

                            <p>My honors year allowed me to write 2 more research articles.  One of them developed or extended the model of dissociative identity disorder to find a middle path or middle ground between the two different treatment options that were offered overseas.  They considered themselves to be rivals. I showed a middle way.  The other of them focussed more on an articulation of the metaphysics of alters or the status of the self.  It was a development of Dennett's model on personal identity.</p>

                            <p>I also wrote a Masters thesis (up to 50,000 words) for Waikato.  I further developed and extended a model of delusions and showed theoretical foundation or basis for how Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (which had only just been introduced in the Waikato region) could be used as a treatment for people with delusions or schizophrenic subjects.  This is novel because the 'party line' was that these subjects could only be treated with pharmaceuticals.  I was offering a theoretical justification or grounding or basis for the humane, person-level, psychological or narrative or talk therapy based treatment of people with these conditions.  To the best of my knowledge this was the first that NZ had heard or considered about how psychologists or narrative therapists or psychiatrists could treat patients by offering talk therapy.  DBT provided a highly structured approach to the talk therapy that could be rolled out.  This was a population that was previously regarded as untreatable.</p>

                            <p>When I started at the ANU it was on the basis of a research proposal that I wrote on emotions.  I started reading a literature on the topic.  I was told that my research on delusions was perhaps a chapter of a doctoral thesis.  I don't really know how that math was supposed to work out since I'd done a 50,000 word thesis on the subject.  I'd also done 2 research articles on the subject.  One offering a solution to the problem of the unwanted prediction that Professor Martin Davies had articulated as a problem.  The other an articulation of the humane or person centred understanding of the content of delusional utterances.  I mean to say, I was getting pretty close to having done a doctoral thesis worth of work on the subject of delusions and their treatment within education / psychology / psychiatry.   </p>

                            <p>Anyway, you can see work I did in 2007 and 2008.  A series of talks.  I would write the talks in advance.  They were structured talks.  It wouldnt' be thath hard to turn them from structured talks like that to an entire book of collected talks.  Mostly I was focussed on trying to understand the classification of psychiatric disorders (the DSM) and getting clearer on whether the borders or boundaries between social work, education, psychology, psychiatry etc were more nominal (in name only) than real.  Or whether there was something specially different about the people or conditions treated by psychiatrists.  Also compared to neurology or brain surgery patients.  I sort of floundered with this.  I suppose I mean to say that if there was a difference I couldnt' really find it or articulate it.  The best theory that we had on offer 'the two-stage view' of scientific aspect and evaluative aspect didn't seem to work out.</p>

                            <p>A doctoral thesis is supposed to be up to 100,000 words and produced over 3 to 4 years.  Allowing a year for external examination where external examiners ask questions publically and there is a public defence.  Only, the 'Universities' of Australasia are increasingly refusing to get studnets work out for external examination and refusing to schedule oral defences.  Even in the day and age of AV technology they won't schedule a public oral defence.  Some candidates are scuttled through quickly while their supervisors won't allow externals to ask questions of their pets.  They defend their pets.  Other candidates don't have their work sent out for external examination at all.  The supervisors just keep taking and taking and taking their work.  What do they do with it?  I'm not sure.  I think in at least some cases they give it away to others to plagarise from or keep as their own.  Else maybe it just is about quashing it and pretending it doesn't exist so that they are the only game in town.</p>

                            <p>I suppose that I did not think about 'gaslighting' specifically.  That is when you basically use the model or type or style of talk therapy that could help delusional subjects articulate what is going on and actually help them..  You use those psychological techniques or strategies to try and write people up as being delusional.  Because of politics.  You want to have everybody believe they are crazy.  So you can take their assets for yourself.  So you can refuse to pay them.  For whatever reason.  You tell them up is down and in is out.  You tell them that it's not cold.  You deny reality and replace it with a system or stream of lies.  You tell a studnet that they 'haven't done enough' for a 120 point 1 EFT MPhil when the Tertiary Education Commission says that that is composed of 34 weeks work only.  Then you tell them that they are too slow because you never sent their work out in time.  And so on.</p>

                            <p>I wasn't too bothered when the ANU didn't get my work out, and so on.  I can provide it here.  That's the evidence that I did the work.  You would have to ask the University Administration and Kim Sterelny why it didn't go out to externals for an oral defence and so on.  I think it was  because they got more and more money from the government for keeping me enrolled.  And because Sterelny liked to say that I had to go away on camping trips and I had to housesit for him when he went away on family trips because it was important for my career etc.  Just garbage.  He's not a very nice man.  Not professional.  He's supposed to be my supervisor.  When did he invite or instruct me to meet with him?  When?  Once?  Twice?  After my being enrolled for 2 years?  Where are the written comments he has on the work that I emailed him?  Is there any evidence that he read it?  My studnet notes say (at one point) that the University department thinks I've only got 3 months more work to go before it's done.  Nobody told me that. Nobody got my work out to externals 3 months later.  What do they pay them for?</p>

                            <p>I came back to NZL thinking it wouldn't be too difficult to get entry to study MBChB.  I thought it wouldn't  be too difficult because (1)  It was supposed to be competitive entry on the basis of full-time GPA and I knew that mine was very high (somewhere between an A and an A+).  (2)  I could apply a few different times.  So, if there are around 3x as many applicants as there are the number of places, things simply aren't that competitive, really, when you consider that an applicant might apply a total of 4 or even 6 times over the course of a few years.  (3)  I was told that mature candidates tended to interview better than younger candidates and I was told that they actually wanted people who had background in things like ethics or arts etc.  I thought I was an ideal candidate, really, for something like psychiatry.  I was also willing to show them that I was interested in the more scientific aspects of medicine (e.g., surgery, radiology, pathology) in case there were concerns about someone being too focussed on psychiatry on the way in.</p>

                            <p>It was genuinely surprising / shocking to me the lengths that NZ 'Universities' went to to remove my application from the applicant pool in order to expedite selection for other canadidates.  The  best sense I can make of this is corruption.  The University of Queensland prompted a report to be written around the issue of the VC's daughter being enrolled in Medicine with Queensland when she was not rank ordered high enough for a place.  University staff complained about her having been enrolled in the qualification so an inquiry was done into how they were selecting studnets for enrolment in that qualification.  They found that the VC was at fault for asking employees if there was 'anything they could do' about her not being offered enrolment in the qualification and him not investigating and putting things right when he found out she had  been enrolled in it.  He voluntarily resigned over it.  He was not removed from office.  She was not removed from the programme.  I'm not sure if he paid a bribe or what for her to be subsequently graduated.  I'm not sure if she was ever employed ot work as a medical doctor.  I'm not sure if he paid a bribe or something for her to be enrolled in specialist training.  I'm not sure how many of her patients have suffered wrongful death or medical misadventure at or by her hands.  I don't think that they looked into whose place she stole and I don't think that the student whose place she stole was offered any reparation at all.</p>

                            <p>It was shortly after this that Chris Whelan was employed to process complaints of serious wrong-doing about NZ Universities.  He was employed and paid several hundred thousand dollars per year as head of the NZVCC to process complaints of serious wrong-doing.  He has used the position to collect up complaints that have been made by both studnets and staff about NZ universities.  What has he done with the complaints?  He says that none of them constitute complaints of 'serious wrongdoing'.  Rather, they are just 'personal problems' the complainant has.  He has refused to collect up evidence around the complaint and he has refused to forward that evidence to police so that they may prosecute wrong-doing.  They will not do it.  </p>

                            <p>The University of Auckland told me that I was not 'eligible' to apply to be enrolled in Medicine.  But this is false. I am over the age of 20 so the education and training act says that I am eligible in fact.  They told me that I was required to complete a new programme of study for the purposes of eligibility, however.  I asked specifically if a 120 point MPhil from Waikato would be enough for them to regard me to be eligible.  THey said that it would.  That since the MPhil was an ungraded qualification they would use the full-time GPA from my previous study.  I wrote, then, a 120 point MPhil for the University of Waikato.  I was writing it at the time when the University of Auckland was supposed to be processing my application for Medicine.  Firstly they refused to offer me an interview time.  They said that I wasn't eligible for interview. I pointed out that none of the first year studnets they were interviewing were eligible for interview.  They were refusing to interview students who were eligible (by statute) and were interviewing students who hadn't even completed 1 year of university study.  They ended up interviewing me then they told me my rank order score was not high enough for offer of place.  I called b*llsh*it on that.  They showed me how they miscalaculated my GPA.  I provided calculations in accordance with how their policy says they will calculate it.  They then said my GPA didn't matter because I wasn't eligible.  THey simply will not process the applications properly for Medicine.  I can only assume that it's because of corrruption.  I suppose that the bulk if not all of the people they enrol in that qualification are not eligible to be enrolled in that qualification.  </p>

                            <p>I suppose it's genuinely difficult all the work they do to ensure that Dr Leeks is the only game in town.  </p>

                            <p>Corruption.  It seems to be. Not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                            <p>Neil Quigley told me to take them to court.  The University of Waikato wouldn't get my thesis out to externals.  Then they sent it out requesting it be examined for a qualification I wasn't even enrolled in.  Just garbage garbage output from the 'university'.  Just will not do it.  Will not have a research output.  Won't even process applications to enrol etc.</p>

                            <p>We don't really have to wonder why we don't have a functioning health system etc.  Corruption.  They will have things no other way.</p>

                            <p>I was genuinely surprised the lengths they went to.  Pulling Judges out of retirement and reappointing them as Judges (that is not the proper process for how Judges are appointed).  They wrote that they couldnt see anything wrong.  It was like they had their eyes poked out.  Not capable of parsing a statute.  Not willing to uphold the laws.  Just won't do it.  NZ does not appear to have a functioning Judiciary.  I was genuinely surprised the lengths that they went to.  The Supreme Court doesn't see anything wrong.  NZ is happy enough to declare that not only does it not have a health system but it also doesnt' have a functioning education system or judiciary.  I mean...  What's left?  Is it a democratic nation at all?  Not even trying to be..  There is no alternative...  What social services?  Not even trying to be fair, at all... </p>

                            <p>I wonder what the plan is, sometimes.  Khan academy does not have a very well developed social policy or sociology or whatever curriculum.  They want to say that the evils of the world are the result of disorganisation which is the absense of organisation.  But that doesn't seem right to me.  I don't see evidence of people not doing their work, say.  What I see evidence of is corruption.  It isn't an absense or lack of organisation, or whatever.  There is a genuine intent.  A force, if you will.  Malevolent intent.  Why?  I guess it's to keep the money out.  I guess it's about how badly things need to be kept in the Stanford Prison Experiment-Land that is NZL (that's the reason for arbitrarily assigning people a social class to be rulers of the harem or one of those kept dependent) so that people will keep handing over USD $80 x 8 ivy league schools (or similar) for 'application processing'.  But why would anybody think they are actually processing the applications?  Go figure.  Harvard is inviting Jacinda Arden to all voluntarily walk away from being elected leader of NZ in exhange for...  How much money was it?  One million over the next 10 or was that 20 or 40 years?  To tell the graduates of Harvard Medical School that nobody would be prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus in NZ (e.g., from all the knock-out baby gene studies) and nobody ever was prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus even when abortion was listed in the crimes act nobody was prosecuted when we had about the highest rate of aborted foetus' in the world...</p>

                            <p>I guess it's the warmongering thing that they do.  MIT manufacture or weapons.  Harvard manufacture of reasons to use them.  Taken over by psychopaths.  Not even trying to be fair.  Nasty.  Real nasty.  What people do you see, over there?  We are really supposed to believe that Harvard is paying for Jacinda's security detail, now, and paying for people to manage her Tweets etc?  I don't think so...  Garbage output.  Garbage garbage garbage.  By design.</p>

                            <p>I guess they are just being increasingly honest about it.  The 'students' trafficked here.  Whatever  happened about the one from China who was raped in her res hall in the 5th year of her 5 year double-degree so she could be hospitalised in the Grafton campus then deported for breech of visa conditions?  Auckland University said they would not re-enrol her and allow her to complete her Degrees.  After she paid how much in international student fees?  After she paid for the entire programme?  NZ seems willing to say 'yes, that's what we are.  That's how we do'.  And the world goes 'whatever'.  Right.  So what sense do we make, then, of the government pretending to hire lawyers and so on, when they don't have judges who will uphold the law.  I mean...  They aren't even pretending to have a functioning judiciary.  If kim.com wasn't paying and paying and paying the courts for NZ to be proclaimed the unlawful detetion camp of the world..  I mean..  We won't extradite him to stand trial in the US. He stays in NZ while he waits for a trial..  He'll die before he stands before a judge in the US.  Right?  So the world just sends all the criminals here.  And however many children they can get away with culling, or whatever.  How would it have been worse for the Uni of Auckland to have done the right thing by that girl?  But they chose to pronounce their corruption.  I guess they are advertising to the world for the criminals to come here and do anything anything to the syphilitic unborn babies or whatever.  It doesn't make any sense to me.  I suppose someone or other gets off on that.</p>

                            <p>Oh, that's right.  It's supposed to be about the normalisation of psychopathy.  That's how come the psychologists could do their research on psychopathy on the first year management studnets, or whatever.  I guess the idea was to only graduate those of them who were the biggest psychopaths, or similar.  Then have everybody believe (rightly if they can get away with it) that psychopathy is the only alternative.  That the people who weren't psychopaths were eliminated long ago.  They lost, they were removed, and the psychopaths only remained.  It's like the wrong people won the war in this part of the world.  We can tell that that is so -- because the atrocities never stopped.  There is no will to stop them.  There is only 'there is no alternative' and 'we don't see anything wrong -- it isn't like what is happening is any different from anything else that is happening'.  There was no other game in town.</p>

                            <p>And then people just keep their mouths shut and keep their heads down.  That's what the Nazi's did -- right?  They just followed orders.  And whistled quietly to themselves happy happy songs whilst marching people off to the death chambers.  They said they were just following orders.  With joy in their hearts.  At least they don't need to keep quiet, now, the very best of us.  The winners.</p>

                            <p>It's not any differnet that Jacinda was pulled out by the US just before the election near the end of her second term.  Same thing happend with JOhn Key.  He was pulled out  by the US to Hawaii.  Who knows where they went to, really, if it was a prison camp or what.  If they were held to account for their crimes.  I guess the idea is for there to be enough ambiguity to placate everone.  Until they take better control of the water, or similar.</p>

                            <p>So the ideal is for people to keep their heads down and their mouths shut...  So that NZL can grow it's business and traffick more and more and more and more and more and more to the death camps?  Is that the plan?  We count the arrivals, apparently, but we don't count how many never make it out, alive.  I guess there's that.  Apparently farce-book is supposed to be some kind of social insurance.  Right.  Because people are indistinguishable from a bot telling the world that everything is okay and they've voluntariliy decided to stay in NZ indefinately and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay all their monies to Harvard.  Yeah, right. </p>
