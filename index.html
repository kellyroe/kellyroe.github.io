                                <p>
                                The work that I had done in the Philosophy of Psychopathology was all based on the assumption that the aim was to help people in ways they themselves wanted to be helped rather than engaging in a harmful process of abuse.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                So, for example, I was trying to extend work that had been done on delusions and therapy so as to develop therapy for people with delusions in a way that may be experienced, by them and their families and communities, to be helpful to the person presenting for treatment. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                But if the aim or the point or the purpose is to unlawfully detain (in conditions of torture, even), then you can see a different function for diagnosing and 'treating' of delusions.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                New Zealand has been exposed to Psychiatry.  New Zealand has the idea of it.  Such that people present to GPs or the ED, asking for help from Psychiatry, specifically.  They invisage a combination of excluding medical causes, sometimes prescribing medication, and monitoring the prescriptions in conjunction with regular psychotherapy.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                New Zealand does not appear to have Psychiatry.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                On example of this occurred to me in 2020.
                                I presented to the ED of the Auckland City Hospital seeking treatment for a physical complaint.  Previous injury has resulted in disfigured and numb toes.  I had been walking extensively during lock-down and ended up with nails coming off, bacterial infection, and I was concerned about possible hookworm infestation from walking barefoot in the Domain. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I presented to the ED rather than my GP because, at that time, the media was reporting that GPs did not have PPE and, at that point in time, the EDs were relatively empty.
                                </p>  

                                <p>
                                They mocked my concern about parasites.  They  placed an IV line in my arm and held me in a seclusion room under 'duty of care' for more than 12 hours.  There were extensive cords from medical equipment.  There was no natural light.  There was an LED that was strobing and medical equipment with regular intemittent beeps.  I was not allowed to phone the police or a lawyer.  These sorts of sensory deprivation conditions are likely to induce delusions in most people.   
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                They sectioned me for a 5 day observation hold under the Mental Health Act on grounds they believed me to be delusional.  They required me to take who knows what psychotropic medication and there is no medication that was charted for me, at all.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                After 5 days they gave me a form saying I was to be kept under the Mental Health Act with 'voluntary' status.  They refused to allow me to leave for another few days and they asserted that I was choosing to stay voluntarily in the hospital.  I was not.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The problem is not that there isn't enough resources for everybody who wants help to have help.  The problem is the bullying and abuse. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The University of Otago experiments on people giving them Ketamine.  The University of Auckland experiments on people giving them hallucinagens (LSD).  They are not getting consent from the experimental subjects before drugging them.  They are not following best prescription practices, they are functioning as laws unto themselves.  Scientists in New Zealand (many of them on government pay-roll as Medical Specialists and / or University researchers) do not think that it is necessary to get informed consent from patients before enrolling them in an observational study, an experimental study, or before 'treating' them with experimental surgeries (for example) or placebos.  They publish in New Zealand Journals and register themselves with New Zealand Medical Councils and New Zealand Organisations because these practices are not acceptable internationally.  They have very tight control over the people they will allow or acknowledge on ethics committees and boards and they ensure those people are kept with no teeth.  The University of Otago Centre for Bio-Ethics Seminars were Video Recorded during my time at Otago so you can see the sorts of atrocities that the people there were informed about, regularly, by various visiting speakers from Wellington.  For example, proposed law changes so that they could experiment on people with dementia (who were not able to provide consent) without their consent.  So, then, a diagnosis of dementia would give clinicians authority to experiment on them as they see fit (and harvest their brains and autopsy their bodies after they had died / been culled).  This is not a health system.  The people engaging in such practices are not good doctors or good scientists.  They have stories they tell themselves about how good science requires atrocities.  They are psychopaths who need to be stopped.  New Zealand presently harbors such people because they will work for cheap / for free and they do not complain about various things like the lack of medical supplies or lack of skilled and trained workers in exhange for the atrocities they committ within the health system of New Zealand.

                                The University of Auckland is required to train me.  They published an algorithm as to how they would select candidates and they are required to apply their f*cking algorithm to my application and, if my rank order score is high enough, train me.  They are required to do it.  Hurry up, already.  Hurry up.  Hurry up.  Hurry up.

                                This is a nasty little despot out-post State of Australia and there is nothing here.

                                The Court of Appeal has deemed Roe v University of Otago (and various other cases) abandoned because Ms Roe failed to pay excess of $7,060 security for costs for the case to be heard on appeal.  They refused to see the matter as being of genuine merit.  They refused to dispense with or reduce security for costs.  Here are the submissions that I filed with the court of appeal:

                                <p>  Here are my submissions for the  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings on grounds that it had already passed judgment on the filings and would not revisit the issue.  The Australian Courts have Jurisdiction over the State of New Zealand.  Here is a <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Link </a> to why I say that (it includes quotes from the Australian Constitution.  They won't accept my filings. </p>
