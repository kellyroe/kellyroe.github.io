 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">

                            <p>I can understand why Harvard wants the democratically elected leader of NZ to read the teleprompts to the NZ people to explain how she's voluntarily choosing to resign in order to...  Be unemployed for a while.  Just voluntarily choosing to walk away from her pay packet.  Then (months later) she's off to Harvard (as a student or person on payroll left unspecified) for a 6 month course in something or other...  I imagine that all the people who pay and pay and pay and pay and pay Harvard to go to what is marketed and advertised as the very very best private University in the USA would like to speak to Jacinda...  The question is:  How much money would you need to buy dictatorship or autocracy so that you could be Lord Saviour and God-King of the Virgin Islands.  No, wait, that's something / someone else.  Let's try that again.  How much money would you need to buy dictatorship or autocracy so that you could be Lord Saviour and God-King of an island in the South Pacific?  Let's aim bigger..  How much money would you need to buy dictatorship or autocracy so that you could be Lord Saviour and God-King of the...  Is it the Second-Largest State of Australia?  How much?  Kim.com was going to buy the election -- right?  We were on track for that, at some point.  But now, instead of him paying and paying and paying and paying to take the election he pays and pays and pays and pays the 'courts' to refuse to extradite him under the presently existing Australian Laws.  Since the State of NZ won't acknowledge the Australian Laws and the Federal Courts of Australia refuse to acknowledge Jurisdiction in NZ.  They can just keep kim.com for further processing in the On-Shore Australian Detention Camp of New Manus Island that is NZ.  Without a trial.  How very...  Australian.  While they wait for the submarines that they can load up people onto and sink them.  Under the water where people can't see...  Because there aren't enough people in Australia wah wah wah wah wah.  We will have to pay money to people to breed...
                            </p>

                            <p>I was reading some article about gaslighting employees the other day.  That's when people in supervisory roles or whatever don't actually do the supervision job for which they are paid.  Instead they bully their employees into handing their work over to them so they can claim credit for it themselves else give it to third parties to claim credit for it.  Take up all the money for themselves and  bully their employees into going away.  Then put various people into place around and about them.  Pimps to get the children to go camping.  Plying the children with alcohol...  Very...  Australian.  Wouldn't you say?  Requiring PhD studnets to go on camping trips and so on...  Not getting their work out for external examination.  Not publically advertising jobs or looking at people's actual work output when it comes time to decide who gets all the research money.  Let's give all the research money to someone to turn Philosophy into second-rate Science.  That's a great idea.  Take all the Philosophy out of the Philosophy Curriculum.  What Philosophy Curriculum?  But then, what University?  They won't acknowledge the research output of people doing research in order to give all the money to people who are horrible obnoxious bullies only.  What evidence of supervision is there for me for my time at the ANU?  I was there as a summer research scholar and Martin Davies refused to write me a reference but the ANU records me being enrolled in their PhD programme.  Then Kim Sterelny refuses to write me a reference and refuses to get my work to externals and refuses to supervise me.  For which he is paid and paid and paid and paid and paid to take the students f*cking camping.  What University?  </p>

                            <p>What hospitals?  What judiciary?  How can there be doctors or lawyers when the University isn't processing enrolments, isn't acknowledging progression through training, isn't graduating people who have met requirements for the qualifications.  Let's only graduate the 'lawyers' who are not capable of doing filings.  Let's only graduate the 'doctors' who follow the instructions written into the patients notes by administration as to who is to die and how they are to die.  Oh, my bad, it's not the administration writing instructions in the patients file.  It must be the AI.  Never was there any better reason to believe in the singularity than 'it must have been the singularity.  The singularity must have done it.  No person is responsible or accountable.  THey were all replaced by robots.  Riiiiiight.  The robots must have done it.  No person is ever responsible or accountable for anything at all.  The source of evil on this world isn't people and their preference for taking studnets camping instead of doing their f*cking work, it must be the singularity'.  Yeah, right.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  You remove the research aspect of the Univesrity (as they did by refusing to process the research work) and you're left with a slave, prison, detention camp.  Who wants to enrol in the Prison Camp of Australia that is the 'premier research institution' that refuses to process students research work?  What Univesrity?  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>The University Administration pretends to be too stupid to process a complaint of wrong-doing.  They won't process the research they say you have to lodge a complaint.  That's good slave-work.  Lodging complaints so the administration can go 'no no no no no no no there could be nothing accepted by the 'university' as being a complaint'. 'In order for us to acknowledge that you have actually lodged a complaint you will need to'...  Ooooooh now we can have fun making up all kinds of stories about what people need to do in order to have their research processed.  I mean in order to have their complaint acknowledged.  Maybe if you go on enough camping trips...  Maybe if you pimp yourself out to one of the old men who should have retired several decades ago..  You should be willing to do anything anything anything.  Right?  It's sooooo competitive, they say.  Must be willing to go on all the camping trips on demand.  Who wants to go to conference and who wants to go to University to have morning tea and afternoon tea.  Lunch and drinks and dinner and drinks.  Really important to keep up the focus on what 'University' is supposed to be about.  The only people they will have on payroll.  What did people actually have to do in order to have their work acknowledged?  Or maybe they didn't.  Maybe they were given work (other people's work) and told they were to pass it off as their own else they wouldn't be acknowledged for anything at all.  Then they were offered jobs on the basis of how many other people's work they stole for themselves or gave away to other people to pass off as their own.  How many people they refused to get their work to third parties and tried to spread rumours that they were non-productive or incompetent so that they could have more and more and more money for themselves to have more and more and more children go 'voluntarily' camping with them.  It's soooooooo competitive they better be willing to do anything anything anything anything.</p>

                            <p>What University?  There doesn't appear to be anything there.  They aren't even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>What Law Graduates?  What Medical Graduates?  What Judiciary?  What Health System?  There's nothing there.</p>

                            <p>What Engineers?  What Plumbers?  Electricians? What Nurses?  Nothing to see, people...  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  Hey, don't forget to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the University so that the people on payroll can tell everyone it's soooooo comeptitive they  better do anything anything anything anything...  What Government Officials?  The graduates of the 'Universities'.  Picked out for how well they performed on their camping trips?  The trips that were sooooooo important to and for their careers?  Yeah, right.  There's nothing there...  Not even trying to be fair.</p>
