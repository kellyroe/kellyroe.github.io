    <p>
    Here is a strategy for the prevention and prohibition of development programme.  All the social service jobs (the 'front line' ones).  Nursing, teaching, medicine.  Even things like plumbing, building, electricial.  All the things.  Law.  Engineering.  All of the 'skilled' work.  What we do is we repeatedly announce that there are shortages in the number of people with these skills and we repeatedly announce that after a certain number of training years people will enter into the workforce relatively easily since there is a shortage and the salaries are whatever they are supposed to be.  Then in the name of the 'training' we put them to 'work' (just get in there and have a go and do your best).  Then, when it is time to sign them off as having completed their training and time to pay them to work the job -- there is always some excuse as to why they aren't going to be signed off as having completed their training else they aren't going to be applying for skilled work else they aren't going to be selected into the position else they aren't going to be paid.  Then we cry cry cry about how there aren't any trained people and try and con or scam a new lot of children, preferentially, into the scummy scam.
    </p>

    <p>I haven't read the Supreme Court Judgement on the voting age being 16 rather than 18 but I am surprised that they decided to announce that it was inconsistent with the Bill of Rights to say that the voting age was 18 rather than 16.  I am very suprised, indeed.  There is quite a lot of research showing that male brains, particularly, are still growing and developing and that that is reflected in behavioral patterns around impulsivity and so on.  That is what is so abhorrrent about the Universities marketing University as being something that children should be doing.  AUT taking 14 year old Vietnamese 'students' and having them enrolled in finance degrees.  Otago and Auckland filling up the Medical Training places primarily with teenagers who are 18 or 19 and throwing away applications from domestic adults who they know full well are more likely to be certain about their career choice. I mean to say they know full well they are more likely to be able to bully teenagers into accepting that they are not going to be graduated from the Medical Training Programme, else they are not going to be going into paid positions, else they are not going to be paid for the work that they do.  The Universities intentionally market to and for children.  Saying it is so fun to party party party during orientation week and so on.  Trying to get the students spending a lot of money on signing up for clubs and so on and the social pressure around getting the students to spend money on alcohol and so on and so forth.  So that they can then go on to blame them for why it is that they are refusing to progress them through their training.  Then bully them into fleeing only to replace them with new children.  To be put to 'work' in the name of 'training'.  
    </p>

    <p>My understanding of the civic right to vote is that it is tied up in other things such as the right to stand for office and it is also tied up in one being required to serve on a jury if called.  These things belong together because the law-making aspect involves making laws regulating the behavior of people such that violating the laws is a criminal offense.  There is a lot of R18 stuff going on in the criminal courts.  Or there would be, if the criminal courts were actually functional if crown law actually did it's job and prosectued.  Trafficking children for purposes of sex abuse (e.g., at the hands of the NZ Government to be abused in state care) and so on.  The Supreme Court thinks that it is infringing on the rights of children for them to be excused from being required to listen to and make judgments about the acceptability or otherwise of such things.  Hearing about people murdering and raping (allegedly).  Listening to Crown Law question children about being sexually abused and so on...  The sorts of things that we think children and teenagers have the right to be protected from.  Special protections for children...  It is supposed to be some kind of step forward in the human rights direction for a country with one of the highest rates of child abuse and so on...  To give children the vote (also right to stand for office and duty to serve on a jury)? </p>

    <p>I, too, wish that the Courts of NZ could focus on doing their job.  For example, Chris Whelan hasn't progressed a single complaint in accordance with policy that he wrote that was supposed to be followed by him in order for him to fulfil his statutory function as CE of the NZVCC.  He refused to perform his statutory function.  The courts seem unwilling and / or unable to remove him from office.  They refuse to uphold the laws that there already are.  They refuse to supply remedy that is available to them in law (to remove people from Government office who are either unwilling or unable or both to do their job).  The Universities of NZ are enrolling studnets in programmes of study they never applied to be enrolled in.  They are refusing to enrol domestic adults as studnets in programmes they did apply to (are eligible for) so as to fill up the positions with teenagers.  They intentionally market to children and then (for example AUT) refuse to graduate more than 1/2 the class.  They record high levels of debt against the students name (with the IRD) and they refuse to give the students their qualifications.  The Statutory Law says that University is primarily for domestic adults (the age of 20 years) but that the minimum age of enrolment can be set by the Univerities.  Most of the Universities say in their Calendar that 16 is the minimum age (conveniently the age that people have been consented for sexual activity by the Government).  But AUT enrolled a 14 year old Vietnamese studnet in Finance so the University used discretion they  believed they had to enrol students who were younger.  The Universities of NZ are not functioning as education and training institutions.  </p>

    <p>I think the end game vision is...  What?  As many 'people' as possible to be kept in Fisher and Paykal type or style incubators in government institutions up and down the land...  With the children or teenagers being put to 'work' getting in there and having a go at maintaining them or that (or not).  Is that the idea?  We can run a little social experiment in having New Zealand as a camp for children.  A children's camp.  Maybe everyone can be exterminated round the age of 25 or maybe even 20 or maybe even 18.  When it is time to pay them for 'skilled work' then it is time for them to go away.  That seems like an appropriate development in teh reverse direction little 'experiment' in social enginnering...  That sounds appropraitely or suitably retarded for New Zealand.  best.  idea.  ever.  </p>

    <p>They don't seem to be able to make up their mind when it comes to 'not enough' and 'too many'.  I mean to say one minute there aren't enough x that's the problem.  Aren't enoguh children, aren't enough student, aren't enough teachers or nurses or laywyers etc.  That's why people can't have.  Because there isn't enoguh.  But then it's sooooo competitive the problem ist hat there are too many.  Too many.  So there needs to be a cull.  So we can get back to cry cry crying about how there isn't enoguh.  There aren't enough buildings for all the kids to go to school.  There aren't enoguh training places.  Kelly can't be enrolled in a 120 point MPhil 05 March 2018 MPhil because there aren't enoguh training places.  I was the only applicant.  Right?  To say the University doesn't have the willingness or ability to enrol me in the programme says the Univesrity doesn't have the willingess or ability to do research.  That's what the ANU says, also.  Nothing on my writing page constitutes a writing sample also they don't have the willingness or abiltiy to supervise in Philsophy.  What Univesrsity?  The Governmetn of NZ and Australia gives the Univesrity money to do what, now?  To keep prisoners, hostages, slaves.  They record enrolments and reenrollments in programmes teh studnet never applied to.  They record levels of debt against the slaves name.  It's a farce.  A hoax.  A scummy scummy scam.  The Judiciary knows.  They know why they don't have lawyers.  THey won't enrol them, progress them, graduate them.  They won't employ them.  How can there be judges when they won't enrol, progress, sign off on completion of law degrees?  All the degrees are honorary they say nothing other than 'we choose you'. What for?  They choose Chris Whelan to do what, now?  To ensure his statutory function (for which he is paid) is not filled by him or anybody else either.  THey pay people to ensure that the job is never done.  The prevention and prohibition of developoment programme.  What a f*cking farce of a hoax of a garbage garbage garbage land.  What a f*cking joke.  I guess what happened was that the Supreme Court of NZ read about how the Supreme Court of the USA overstepped it's bounds by making a decision that went beyond their job or role and went 'meeeeeee tooooooo'.  Because if it's one thing that we seem determined to do it's to find new lows in the how slow can we go campain for the prevention and prohibition of developometn programme.</p>
