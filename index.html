 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->

                            <article>

                                <p>
                                    I was fairly sure that Ashley Bloomfield did a MBChB BEFORE doing a...  What was that?  A 120 point 1 year Honors Programme followed by a 120 point 1 Year Research Masters?  Or was that a 120 point 1 year Honors Programme followed by a 240 point 2 Year Masters?  Maybe a 2 Year Masters comprised of 1 year of course-work followed by a 1 year thesis?  Or maybe that was 120 point 1 year Honors followed by a 120 point 1 year course-work followed by a 240 point 2 year up to 50,000 word only Masters.  Or maybe that was a 10 year Masters?  Or maybe that was a 6 year Medical Degree followed by 2 years as Junior Doctor followed by 1 year of Honors followed by...  Anyway...  Waiting for Ashley's salary reveal, now.  He was picked out all special snowflake like to do Clinical Training to actually see patients in the capacity as Medical Doctor -- right?  He was given one of the limited training places (we don't have any doctors cry cry cry we don't have any doctors who can see patients cry cry cry we don't have enough training places to train any more doctors cry cry cry no training places no doctors to see patients).  He was picked out for a limited entry training place to train to work with patients.  Before being paid off half a million dollars a year NOT to see patients.  Right?  Isn't that the basic idea...
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    I do not deny that he seemed calm and measured and those kinds or sorts of things that were rightly valued during that time.  Of course, it is easier to come across that way (to be seen to exemplify those characteristics) when one earns half a million dollars per year and when people actually listen to what it is that you have to say.  So you can just speak once.  Instead of having to say the same thing over and over and OVER AND OVER and f*cking well over again AND F*CKING WELL OVER AND OVER AGAIN JAMMING IT UP THEIR F*CKING ASSES.  I think that most people would really appreciate the luxury of not needing to bang on (and on and on and on and f*cking on...).
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Regarding competence...  The initial lockdown was not lawful.  But that's okay.  The laws don't seem to matter insofar as certain special snowflakes are concerned.  That's a wonderful message to be sending to the kiddies.  I didn't know that people could or would be appointed Professor (presumably in a non-honorary capacity) without a PhD.  Without extensive publications in the field.  Still...  What 'University', eh?  I mean, as head of an institution he gets to put himself down as first author on anything that comes out of the institution, I suppose.  Anything that is allowed to.  Anything that goes off to external examiners etc etc is pre-screened by Ashley.  Is that the idea/l?  I can see why they would be concerned to have a half a million dollar a year servant censoring the outputs of anything in public or population or policy or whatever it is health.  They really do need to just move it all to Massey.  Train them with the people who look after the meat and milk and racing animals.  The whole mentality around population management and so on.  Making sure the people have their shots (immunisation or euthanasia on schedule). 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                     The whole..  *Adoration* of Ashley...  Didn't anybody think that maybe it was...  Not irony, exactly...  I do wonder what his sons are doing now.  Maybe a special piece on them?  I would imagine that he's paying off Harvard or whomever millions upon millions to babysit his children.  Maybe...  Maybe they have gone off to Epstein Island for a while...  Who knows...  I do feel concerned about his children since they were forced to stay inside his home while he deeclared the whole nation unlawfully to be in lockdown with impunity or immunity.  Best do what Daddy says, eh, now.  Who'se your Daddy?  Wonder who his Daddy was for him to be picked to do MBChB in the first  place.  And why they didn't want him to be GP in the RC (Where Shane Reti was supposed to be -- his internship location...  But he's paid off, now, to not see patients.  Right?)  Ayesha...  She's paid off, now, to not see patients.  Right?
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    I wonder about his student loan.  I guess he chose to 'invest in his education' when he paid how much in fees to study for how many years?  To get to be appointed Professor...  Wow.  Does he have experience tutoring at University?  Does he have experience grading?  Does he have experience teaching?  Does he have experience writing publications for academic journals?  Does he have appointment as Junior Lecturer?  For how many years was he a temporary hire only before he made tenure?  That must have been quite the moment for him.  Tenure.  Achieving that after laboring for so long for academia.  What a nice thing to see all his efforts for academia duly compensated (not financially, of course, some things like tenure or Professorships apparently money can't buy -- they are just given away).  
                                </p>

                                <p>My understanding was that you aren't allowed to supervise a student doing a qualification that is higher level than the one that you have.  But perhaps the new institution is what New Zealand likes to call a 'terminal masters programme' -- right Doctor Ashley?  M.D.  No.  MBChB.  Which was an undergraduate level degree...  Followed by a 120 point or a 240 point Masters or something else?  What a quality hire for the 'University' in everything it is that they value...  Now back to your regularly scheduled programming of the Bloomfield Show (that would be Angela rather than Ashley).  Daugher of the administrator marries the hed of surgery.  The New Zealand dream.  Riiiiiight.  Quality programming right there.  Wah wah wah we don't have any doctors...  Right Doctor Ashley.  MBChB (an undergraduate degree) MA...  No..  Not a Master of Arts.  I don't know what the letters are that goes with Public Health.  'Doctor', apparently.  'Professor' even.  For all the civil servants who graduate from the civil service once they tire of earning half a million per year for their service.
                                </p>

                                <p>I mean, what a big 'F*CK YOU' to people like Angela.  I mean to say the co-ordinator of MEDSCI142.  The University won't even give her a PhD for all the work she has done in Medical Education over the years.  Over how many years?  Get her work to external examiners did they?  How little do they pay her for all the work that she does?  All the people who have labored for the University for how many years...  For how many years...  To have a VC appointed from Nottingham (no ties to New Zealand) and then people like Ashley Bloomfield be appointed PRofessor when he doesn't have background in Academia and he doesn't even have a Phd.  I mean to say he never did the work for one.  Did he?  Or maybe the people missed that.  Maybe he enrolled in the PhD after all?  Or they found one in the trophy room and sent it out with his name on it?</p>

                                <p>So the new academic pathway involves people leaving school and heading to Wellington.  THey can then smooze and smooze and smooze their way into all the civil servant parties and cry cry cry for entry level positions in the civil service.  Maybe live in a contractors basement for a year or two or three..  The 'frictional unemployment' while the jobs are largely handed to the administrators children, anyway.  And then you work your way up the $$$$ tree as a civil servant.  Those are the jobs for life.  They never fire you or remove you from office.  Eh Chris Whelan?  And what are we supposed to believe about Ashley.  Quarter of a million dollar salary per year, now?  Because he's giving up money to be a public servant?  Or is he chasing the money and this opportunity is even more lucrctive for him.  ALllll of the research fudnign for Ashley, I can only suppose.  Anyway..  So that's the career trajectory.  Civil servants work their way up to being appointed Professors of the University.  Wow.  Still.  Hard to explain to the kiddies that the way to get to Harvard is to, apparently, do con-munications at Waikato as an undergrad and then wait for them to send you a letter offering you a PhD.  Work hard in school kiddies.  Yeah, right.  </p>

                                <p>Hey, it's nothing new.  Waikato was only training 8 Clinical Psychologists per year.  Where are they now?  They have lucrative Government jobs NOT TO SEE PATIENTS.  They get those lucrative Government jobs NOT TO SEE PATIENTS because the training programme involves indoctonating them into believing that they only get to make things worse therefore it would be all but unethical for them not to follow the money trail into managment where you manage the funds me-wards and document how 'treatment' only makes people worse therefore do not treat.  Do not employ any clinical workers.  Do not train any clinical workers.  Alllll of the money for me.  Only me.  Only me and my selfishness.  Apoptosis of all the skilled labor and work in New Zealand.  Apoptosis of the University and the Polytech and so on and so forth.  What education and training system?  It's sooooooooo cmopetitive.  Nommy nom nom we loves to eat the babies...</p>

                                <p>In fact, apparently Dawn Freshwater (is that her real name?  That sounds like the kind of name that people voluntarily choose to change their name to) went to University and trained to be a mental health / psychiatric nurse.  But then instead of workign with patients as a mental health or psychiatric nurse (wah wah wah there aren't any we don't have any) they pay her out to  be an administrator.  So...  I guess what I am really wondering..  What matters most-est to me...  Is whether these people who sold out or were brought off or whatever whatever there wsa no alterntive...  They are working in administration not clinical after having taken up an 'it's soooooo competitive' limited entry training place...  Whether they are working to make things better so that other people can actually train in, graduate from, and work in the fields.  Or whether they are doing the whole prevention and prohibition and stabotage thing.  I mean, I don't know if Ashley wanted to be a Doctor and the only way his Daddy would accept him not seeing patients was if he could tell his Daddy there was more money in the Government position to not see patients.  Or if Ashley wanted to be a doctor but was bullied into fleeing the field entirely...  And so what his aim or goal is or whtever about that now.  WHether his aim is to prevent and prohibit others.  Quite what it is that he's sooo butt hurt about.  If he is.  Or quite what is going on or down...  Wrapping up of the University.  The 'University' ahem.</p>

                                <p>All the work that Angela does making sure that nobody is dissecting  rat who isn't supposed to be.  Come on.  CORRUPTION.  Come on...</p>

                                <p>I  mean..  I don't know if Dawn Freshwater was appointed by international community primarily, in response to students claiming that they had been raped in residential halls, detained by Psychiatry in Grafton in a manner or way that involved them breeching their visa conditions, then deported in violtaion of their visa conditions having completion of their qualification/s withheld.  I don't know if she was appointed to put a stop to these practices and actually help improve the quality and integrity of the University, I mean to say.  Or if her hire was simply to provide some false hope to the people delaying the inevitable demise just a little bit while she takes as much money out as she can along the way.  She has knowledge of mental health nursing in the UK, I mean to say.  So she'd likely be in the position to be able to say a few things about the way that the Grafton Psychiatric facility is being run / managed / maintained and about the pipleine from University of Auckland (particularly) to people being detained and deported without their qualifications.  I do hope they are trying to fix things up, genuinely.  Gee.  I wish I could help.  I think that Quigley is a nasty little man in fact.  That is what I think.  I have seen no reason whatsoever to think otherwise.  But, then, the Univesrity of Waikato has next to nothing to do with the Waikato hospital and even the DHB, I suppose, was a southern outpost of Auckland, I guess.  Aiming and aspiring to have all the accreditation taken away...  </p>

                                <p>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/shameful-and-disgusting-university-of-auckland-slammed-for-kicking-out-student-over-mental-health-issues/FDEFC7RIRFMKTB3CJ6E4YLAZDU/  This happened under Stuart McCutcheon (before Dawn Freshwater arrived).  Ashley wants to get involved in this (there are particular problem with the whole 'Public Health' thing since you have studnets who want to do Medicine and the entitled f*cking brats of the admnistration thinking they can do anything anything anything they please with no consequences to themselves in virtue of who their parents are.  Process my application to Medicine.  We don't need to look to 'no speak English' to find another psychiatrist for the PRofessor Glue factory.  F*cking hurry up and process it according to the algorithm you published for the purposes of accountability.  It's not rocket science.  </p>

                                <p>I mean, we saw the Public's reaction or response to Uffindell's underware trophy display when he was an undergraduate at Otago.  Of course the people like to think that the point of Medical Selection would be NOT TO SELECT such grossly unsuitable candidates.  I think the people might be interested to know how many of those kids of kids are deemed 'must have' for things like Medicine and Law.  I mean, they don't complain about the lack of informed consent in Medicine.  They aren't going to tell if unauthorised people are in the OR or are performing a little something something on the down low while a person is heavily sedated.  They aren't going to complain about gropey partner in the office party.  Or about the worse things that happen where it is very strongly implied that if you don't put out (or do anything anything anything on demand) then there never will be a job for you.  Some people will give their eye teeth, apparently.  While some other people..  Want to take them.  Must have.</p>

                                <p>I mean, think about it for 5 minutes.  All the kids being pimped out and abused in state care.  Being presented by Government appointed guardians with bruises and broken teeth and bones.  With sexually transmittted diseases.  Being flaunted before the hospital employees by people on Government payroll to abuse those children.  Now..  Does the Government want to employ people in the hospital who will raise the issue with people higher up..  Or does the Government want to employ people in the hospital who will keep their yap shut?  Now, who is a better bet to keep their yap shut?  Someone who jumps in for a little something something for themselves while the opportunity presents to them?  Or something else?  You think about it.  Do the math (so to speak).  Must have.</p>

                                <p>All the energy and effort and actual *work* involved in whipping people to hurry the f*ck up in the race to the bottom.  To get in behind the likes of Dawkins selfish selfish.  His seifish genes.  Telling us the meaning of life.  The meaning of life for old women (who won't sleep with you)  is actually to look after your babies.  Didn't you know.  Old women are only there to be grandmother to other people's selfish genes.  Selfish selfish selfish.  The most selfish wins what is most important in life.  I suppose.  The whole narcissisis in love with his reflection thing.  Fell into the water and was one with the happiest moment of his life.  Shame about him dragging everybody else in with him.  Aye.</p>

                                <p>Eye surgery...   https://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/130418170/eye-surgeon-ian-dallison-pleads-guilty-to-attempted-murder  Mmmmm.  Wouldn't you do anything anything anything anything for him?  Anything anything anything anything to be hand picked chosen as special, by him, to be the next eye surgeon?  Anything anything anything for a reference from him?  Anything anything anything for his recommendation?  New Zealand doesnt' have surgeons because of...  DUUUUH...  UUUUUUH...  AWEKTKDHGKDRKL no spikkity da engleeeeeeesh.</p>

                                <p>P.S., my whole thing about 'no spikkity da English' is because...  I know that this is the speel that they say to international students.  That their grades (for example) don't matter.  Because their english is (allegedly) not good enough.  That's the reason why.  THe reason why they weren't selected.  Why they weren't hand picked chosen as special.  And the reason why I focus on this, in particular...  Is because the people who they hand pick choose in fact (despite their selection algorithm and not at all because of it)...  They are only so willing to say they 'no speak english' when it comes to them being held accountable for their actions or decisions.  I mean to say they intentionally seem to hand pick choose psychopaths or deviants who claim to be 'no spikkity da engleeeeesh' when it comes to accountability for their oversights or crimes.  Two faced ness.  That's what I mean to say.  Lacking in the honesty.  Lacking in the integrity.  It wouldn't matter so much...  But this is healthcare.  Public healthcare.  For teh people.  The workers of the economy (trying if only the govt would stop with teh stabotage)...  Etc...  Waikato...  The dairy farming contributors to the economy.  You are welcome (atrocies, atrocies, atrocities all round).  Why doesn't Shane Reti see patients?  Wasn't his Daddy all gunning for him (supposedly) to attend the University of Waikato...  Therefore he's apparently hand-picked for Medicine with Auckland (after first year at Auckland?) and then expediated (choppers!) to Harvard to learn about helecopter medicine..... To witness the lack of healthcare up north... To feel disempowered...  To enter into policits to make meaningful change, therefore..   Meaningful change being to have the peopel of his electorate accept the lack of healthcare for them...  Alllll the money for Shane Reti!!!!!!!!! Allllllll of the money for him!!!!!!  Sigh.  That would be racist.  Why pick out the low hanging fruit...  He's Maaori though no fault of his own.  As is Winston Peters.  Why hold them to that?  I call not fair.  Not fair.  True story.  Hold them to the same standards as everyone else...  But it is unfair to pick or single them out...  Because they are (though no fault of their own) the low hnging fruit.  They are clearly brilliant or genius in fact at everything it is that the white person values...  That's why they were hand picked...  I don't envy them in fact...</p>

                                <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/300766750/the-number-of-kids-being-taken-from-their-parents-has-plummeted-history-tells-us-the-pendulum-could-swing-back  Why was his Mother in prison?  I ask because I wonder if she was sent there because people had sights on her son.</p>

                                <p>I'm sorry...  It should have been obvious to me...  The very very very very first thing that Ashley is going to do in his appointment as Professor is...  Strike for better pay.  LMFAO</p>

                                <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/481090/volunteer-devotes-more-than-40-years-fighting-for-justice-for-lake-alice-victims  Wow... He labored and labored and labored for his slave pay.  Right????  I'm sorry...  Allllllllllllll of the titles and honors and awards and money and women and access to the children for Ashley!!!  All heil almighty God of Ashley!!!!!!  Aren't you SOOOOOOO GLAAAAAD that Ashley was specially handpicked as chosen to be the one and only one who was allowed to work with clinical patients (who will never be allowed to work with clinical patients) there must never be enough to go around it's soooooooooo competitive!!!! People must be forced to give their eye teeth (at least) to be hand picked specially chosen for...   Half a million dollars per year for...  Half a million dollars per year for...  Half a million dollars per year.  So...  When peopel tatoo your face upon them do you think it is so they will never forget to sing your praises...  Or so...  They will never forget to..  Uh.. Something else.  Shall we say...  Uh... Something else.   ffs.  It processes the application according to the published algorthim for f*cking well processing them.  Duuuuuh.  Maybe in 20 generations of improvment on the current gene pool it might.  I mean..  FFs.  Seriously></p>

                                <p>not sit well with him as many hospitals were short-staffed today.

"But they don't go abusing their patients like they did at Lake Alice."  LOL.  Why would you think that?  I mean, seriously.  They delay delay delay and obstruct and deny...  They genuinely seem to think that if they can delay for long enough they will have created a 'new normal'.  That is or means to say...  Well..  By delying me justice they have asserted the right for Universities New Zealnd to record students enrolment also failure in courses the studnet never applied to be enrolled in.  While also refusing to get work studnets have done to external examiners to prevent and prohibit interntional community from saying the studnet has done enough for a graduate research qualification.  They think they get to pick and choose whomever they want for whatever arbitary reasons they want.  Look at the arbitrary reasons that they want:  Dr Leeks.  Enough said.</p>

<p>Why would anybody think that Dr Leeks is dead?  I think it most likely that he is having a party party party with Epstein.  Revelling in their sexual abuses of children.  Because it makes them feel particularly big about themselves.  Wouldnl't you say?  What reason would anybody have to believe the contrary?  Open casket funerals?  Independent DNA testing of the corpses? Dental records?  What a f*cking joke...  </p>

<p>Well then, bonus!  Once they've been incapacitated with the 'dyslexic' label they can then be incpacitated with the 'illerate' and / or 'innumerate' label.  Their anxiety is a good sign that they understand their position in life (that dyslexia is good or reasonable grounds for pronouncing illiteracy and innumeracy) oh..  And also anxiety as well.  So, to be clear... The reason why you don't make living wage.  The reason why your work isn't given to external examiners.  The reason why you don't get qualifications youve completed the requirements of... Is because... You were proclaimed and pronounced to be incapacitated so!!! Boo yah!!! Ashley...  Capable of following the laws?  Not so much.  Well then.  He will have the very very very very best stories to tell the children.  I'm sure.  Let's all protest because Ashlely needs a payrise!!! Alllllllll of the payrise for Ashley!!!!! I mean, I'm sure nobody has invested more in a NZ Tertiary Education than him (in both time and money).  I bet he's got a hell of a mortgage to pay off.  Squillions of slaves etc.

<p>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/autism-and-our-gut-microbiome/VBPVZX4BSI6NK2SD7KPZDP33HE/  Oooooh let's fund another study to explain to the people how and why they get to be proclaimed and prounounced 'austistic'. Therefore alllll of the money for Ahley.  Thereofre alllll of the jobs for Ashley.  THerefore allllllll of the work for Ashley.  The most incapacitated and incompetent (according to Ashley and Ashley-like payroll only game in town psychopaths) allllll of the everything for Ashley.  All heil the mighty God of Ashley.  Never was a leader seen since Hitler!!! Soooooo charasmatic.  The people will do anything anything anything anything anything...  OOOoooh please, Ashley.  Pick me!! Pick me!!! Pick me!!!</p>

<p>Mmmmm wealthy tourists..   https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/481086/as-hospitals-fill-with-covid-19-patients-surgeon-warns-against-driving-stupid  There for the taking...</p>

<p>https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2022/12/christchurch-eye-surgeon-pleads-guilty-to-attempted-murder-of-former-landlord.html  Well.  Now the whole world understands why NZ can't process my applciation for Medical School in accordance with teh criterion published for the purposes of accountabilty.  So many MUST HAVES who the University is willing to break the rules to enrol.  So very very many MUST HAVES...</p>

<p>There was some article that I saw recently about how the present ills of NZ Univerities came from the Governmetn deciding that University (aka students pay us and we don't pay them) for everybody (rather than an elite few) was responsible for the ills of mankind.  Ooooh.  Wanting to make the University great again...  What do you think it was great for, in teh first place?  Was the University supposed to be a place where Ashley could send his sons and just so long as or insofar as he paid them enoguh money they would publically allow them to graduate (present them wtih qualification certificates and photoshop opportunities for a handshake)?  Was the University supposed to be a place that the likes of Eienstein would be failed out of?  Let's be clear...  What University is for or is supposed to mean?  Is it just announcing Bart Simpson gets to be safety inspector because he's the only graduate from that Degree Programme?  Is that the basic idea?</p>

<p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/300769326/imposter-doctor-kept-working-for-four-weeks-after-alarm-raised-with-medical-council  It is not plausible that he managed to 'doctor' himself a fake identification card that would have University of Auckland staff fooled into thinking he was on the roll.  Think about it for 5 minutes.  The staff have a class list.  The class list has the name and identification number (and sometimes even photographs from the students idenfication card - useful to help you learn their names).  THey know how many studnets in total are in the class.  Often they have seating plans in laboratories.  Particularly when there is a limited resource or whatever that means students are required to work in small groups.  How many students were supposed to be working together in a group in the cadavar lab?  Was it something like 7 students per cadavar?  It defies credibility that the staff did not realise on the very first day that someone was there who was not supposed to be in there.  It defies credibility that they were not checking very very carefully who was in fact in there.  So...  Either the people on payroll to be checking are corrupt.  ALlowing him in when they knew he wasn't supposed to be.  Or, there is something problematic from higher up.  I mean to say, someone gave him a functioning identification card and put him on the roll.  I wonder if he was in fact selected into Medicine they are just pretending to disown him now.  Now that it is time to pay him.  Because they aren't going to pay him for the work now.  Right?  They are calling him a fraud and putting him in prison.  Why did it take 5 weeks to investigate him?  Because they don't have to pay him.  Right? </p>

<p>Medical Doctors should be registered.  Right?  They should have a registration number.  When they write a prescription on their pad they write their registration number on the pad.  That way if a doctor is writing lots of prescriptions for restricted or controlled substances (e.g., opiates or benzos or meth or whatever) then that rings alarm bells.  What do the pharmacies do with the prescription pads that they get?  I remember something about Purdue Pharmaceuticals intentionally choosing to target states that were not required to file prescriptions in triplicate.  One for the pharmacy.  One for I don't remember.  The patient?  One for the Feds.  So the Feds could keep an eye on the precriptions for drugs that were marketed as 'non addictive'.  Anyway...  That of course means that New Zealand is not there yet.  How do you hire a Medical Doctor to be on staff without a registration number?  That is about as plausible as thinking that someone was in the cadavar laboratory without being on the roll for the class.  That is about as plausible as thinking that someone is in the operating theatre maybe even actually getting in there and having a go when they aren't supposed to be.  What a f*cking farce.  PROCESS MY APPLICATION TO ENROL.  PROCESS IT -- ELSE SHUT IT DOWN.  IF THERE REALLY ISN'T ANYTHING THERE EXCEPT FOR A MASSIVE FRAUD OR HOAX UPON THE PEOPLE THEN SHUT THE F*CKING THING DOWN, THEN.  I mean the University.  That appears to be the end game?  Record enrolments when nobody applied to the programme.  Record student loans for programmes the studnet  never applied to.  Don't graduate people who have completed the requirements.  Give working identification cards and staff cards to people who allegedly or apparently were never enrolled and never graduated.  Let me guess, they never even applied to work that job and you don't actually pay tehm?  A fraud or hoax upon all the people. </p>

<p>Where is Ashley going to live?  I am worried about him.  Is the University buying him a house?  Someone could look into how much rent he is supposed to pay from his salary (if any).  Remember the whole sh*t show around the benefits that were to be given to Dawn Freshwater?  I would imagine they will be doing a similar thing with Ashley given how valuable of a servant he is.  A real politician for the people.  Doctor Ashley.  MBChB.  Was that a 1 year masters or a 2 year masters or something else?  What did you apply to do..  And what did they record on your transcript?  I'm interested in the enrolment dates.  A fraud on all the people...</p>

<p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/481106/new-zealand-made-software-putting-schools-at-risk-of-cyber-attack  I would imagine that the interesting thing is to see how many kids are written up or recorded by their schools as being illiterate etc etc...  And then seeing the online or internet presence of those kids.  I mean to say, all the illiterates writing novels or whatever.  Having intelligent conversations with people.  I imagine it will become quite apparent how many people have been tagged by their government or local community as low value people with low skills etc etc who actually are very intelligent and literate and so on.  The whole 'tall poppy syndrome' of how everybody has to get in behind the son of the administrator (say) who was picked to be the next god-child in virtue of who his daddy was...  And the dumb and dumber those kids are the dumb and dumbber every other kid has got to pretend to be...  Why are we scuttling so hard to be what England was like around the time of it's downfall?  Too much inbreeding and no meritocracy...  They say it's about 'social skills'.  But it's about being a bully.  It's about looking people deep into their eyes and saying 'sweet nothing sweet nothing sweet nothing anything you want to hear' and then doing whatever the hell you like...  The great con..  </p>

<p>How hard can it possibly be to take the grades and input them into the selection algorithm and declare my rank order score?  You were willing to tell me that it was 8.0 and when I said 'I don't believe you, show me how you calculated that' and you showed me how you didn't apply your algorithm as written at all.  Your algorithm said the BEST 120 points (if more than 120 points were taken than any summer school course above stage 1 would contribute).  You didn't calculate my BEST 120 points (according to that definition where my stage 2 and 3 summer school papers were contributors to my GPA).  Your algorithm said that it applied to the most recent years of full time study.  That means 120 points.  If you do a 120 point Masters over 2 academic years (and one summer school period) as the Univesrity of Waikato had me do...   Then that means I was enrolled in less than 60 points per academic year.  Which is not full time at all.  So my GPA for my 120 point Masters smeared across 2 years and 1 summer school period is irrelevant for my GPA.  Now, I wasn't doing the Masters to bring up my GPA.  In fact, my best 120 point per year GPA (including summer school papers above stage 1) is 8.6.  At which point they cry 'you can't just calculate it however you like'.  How am I supposed to respond to this?  I know you are, but what am I?  I calculated it in accordance with the algorithm that you published for the purposes of your accountability.  You were happy to tell me that it wasnt' high enough for me to be selected.  Then when I point out that you aren't calculating it properly now you cry 'it doesn't matter because you aren't even eligible to have applied!'  But the Education and Training Act states that since I am a domestic adult who has attained the age of 20 years..  SInce I in fact applied to the programme.  I am eligible.  The Statute tells me so.  So...  Why won't you calcualte my GPA properly?  According to the published algorithm as to how you are going to do it?  Tell me what my rank order score was.  You gave my place to someone else.  I expect.   I mean, if my rank order score was not high enough for a place they would have had no reason not to rub my face in that actuality.  The only reason I can think of for them doing it incorrectly and then refusing to do it correctly is because it was high enough for a place in fact.  You know...  They are supposed tobe happy and pleased for me.  You would think they would be.  Happy for me.  Since I've worked for it for quite some time...  F*cking psychopaths.  Eh.  Indeed.  F*cking psychopaths.  Hand picked Dr Leeks for all the qualities they value.  Despite their selection algorith.  Not plausible to think the latest 'fraud' forged himself onto the student roll.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

<p>If surgeons and pathologists worked more closely together do you think there would  be a rise or increase in hospital associated infections, or a decrease?  I mean to say if pathologists were not properly independent from surgeons then do you think there would be an increase or decrease in findings of septic this and that post-surgery.  I mean to say that the bacteria gets in during the operation and however long after things go septic.  Maybe because the 'surgeon' left a little something something that was supposed to be on the tray before closing...  Maybe because they wouldn't pay anybody to autoclave the equipment properly.  Now...  How about radiology?  If radiology is not properly independent from surgeons then do you think there would be an increase or decrease in unnecssary operations being performed?  I mean to say an increase or decrease in patients being given pretty colored pictures with the problem area colored in red, say, to justify why there is something mechanically wrong with them that is best fixed by someone who professes to be a surgeon (I guess that makes the surgeon a professor!)?  And if the person doesn't see the light, I mean see the red and understand that that means that surgery is right for them...  Well, the 'surgeon' can bill ACC for the surgery anyway and maybe even get a court order to hold the person in prison, I mean hospital, so the prison, I mean hospital, can collect up how much money per day to keep the person involuntarily I mean voluntarily detained since they have been consented?</p>

<p>We are supposed to have the right to refuse 'medical treatment'.  We are also supposed to have the right to be presented with a range of options or alternatives (not just 'my way or I get a court order because my way there is no highway there is only my way').  We are supposed to have the right to a second opinion.  The courts don't seem to understand that reasonable people can disagree.  I mean to say, in the USA, it is understood that when there is a court or legal case involving expert witness from medical or health professionals then each side calls it's own witnesses.  I mean to say, the person who did the autopsy for the government is not usually the same person as the person who does the autopsy for the side of the case that is concerned about corruption within the government.  You get the idea.  It was terrible indeed that in the fight over the surgeons way being the only way for the infant with the stenotic valve...  The courts refused to allow 1 extra week so that the parents could bring expert medical professional in from the USA (since there didn't seem to be any in NZ).  I mean to say the courts refused to allow the issue of whether the surgery was in fact in the best interests of the child to be properly heard or considered by the courts.  They refused to allow medical professionals who were going to question the necessity of the surgery to testify.  </p>

<p>My medical textbooks...  They don' encourage the NZ kids to read them... But my medical textbooks...  Part of the study for Medicine that the USA kids do to study for their examinations...  My Medical Textbooks...  Say that people can do surprisingly well with rather severe mechanical defects to their heart.  That is or means to say, they aren't often matters of life and death, actually.  No urgency required in decisions such as this.  Time for a fair and proper hearing of the issue.  I think it is terrible that there was not a fair hearing of the issue in the courts.  The judge hurried through a  bad decision under urgency.  It should have gone through the court of appeal.  Look...  What was the worst thing that could have happened?  What was the court so afraid of?  The possibility of the operation not happening in a timely enough fashion and the infant actually dying from not having the operation.  NOw...  This kind or sort of thing actually happens in our health system or service all the time.  People don't get the operations that they need in a timely fashion and they die.  So why does everybody (the nurses and the surgeon and the courts) feel so very very particularly abuot this particular child?  Maybe it's because the memory of Malachi is so recent.  That was a problem of under-delivery of service, shall we say.  They didn't intervene -- but they should have.  Retrospectively.  Hindsight is a wonderful thing.  Maybe.  If we think that maybe they aren't overt psychopaths.  Maybe what's goign on is over-compensation.  They weren't aggressive enough intervening in Malachi's case so they are going to over-shoot in what they do the next case that happens to come along.  And since this kid was an incubator baby the attachment is there.  I mean to say the pediatric nurses and doctors have attached to the kid.  They got between the kid and it's mother, even, the whole filial inprinting thing.  That's what they've been finding.  Right?  Kids who are living in the hospitals when they don't need to be there medically only the people who are on payroll (presumably) to work in the hospitals have attached to the kids and they say that there isn't anywhere safe for the kids to be...  The kids are better being raised in teh institution.  And they bill for having tehm, of course.  Fill up all the beds in the hospital...</p>

<p>So...  Narrowing of the right valve...  I don't know why...  Valves are actually not made of tendon.  NOt sure why I thought they were.  They are actually comprised of layers of cells.  That is or means to say they grow over time.  Of course they do.  The heart grows over time, you see.  Childrens hearts are obviously much smaller than adults hearts.  The valves grow over time.  So...  If there is a narrowing of the vessels...  I don't know...  Sometimes growth is a bit strange.  Sometimes people's left side grows before the right side or something like that.  But things tend to even our mostly.  But sometimes developmetn proceeds like that.  In strange ways with strange asymmetries.  I don't know if valve problems or stenosis in kids is like that.  The textbooks say that whether something is a problem is whether there is symptom presentation.  I mean to say, if the kid is looking blue (deoxygenated).  If the blood oxygenation is down in fact.  If the ventricles are becomming overly enlarged to compensate (to work harder to push blood through a narrower opening).  Bearing in mind that the heart is still growing.  That is or means to say it likely isn't growing now any over-shoot of where it is going to end up if things were to end up entirely normal.  Right?  Because the kids's so small.  With no symptoms.  And the courts refused to wait 1 week to hear expert testimony saying that there wasn't urgency around this and saying that the parents might have other options available (e.g., overseas) even if the surgery did in fact turn out to be likely in teh best interests of the child.</p>

<p>Bulllies.  Hey.  Just blatent f*cking heavy-handed bullying.  By the nurses and the doctors and the courts.  Why?  I genuinely don't understand...  Well...  The nurses and the doctors got attached to being the hero...  I udnerstandt hat...  ANd the kid is a good patient, I suppose.  Is he especially cute?  They've really attached to that kid...  And who knows what is up with the courts.  I guess you have these old judges used to laying down the law.  So to speak.  Thinking that medicine is about closing ranks around or about the rightness of the decisions of the people within.  That it is not possible for reasonable medical professionals to disagree.  Limiting the information trying to force only one alternative.  Culture of bullies.</p>

<p>So...  How many (arguably) unnecessary operations are performed every year?  What I wonder, is how many 'operations' are invoiced for where all that is done is the person is anesthetised for a while maybe with a superficial cut so they themselves think they received an operation and so they get paid for having performed one when they really didn't do much in the way of anything at all.  ANd then then you go, and maybe that's the best case.  Worst case they opened up deepter compartments inside people so that the skin bacteria could be dragged in.  Else they got biological substance like hyper-allergenic wool or similar and actually left that kind of thing inside to likely create ongoing inflammation and be a nidus for bacteria to cling to forever after...  Maybe necessitating further exploratory surgeries where they see if they can find the difference between what was on the tray at the start of hte operation and what was not on the tray before the head surgeon declared it was time to close...  I guess the cameras that are up in every surgical theatre would tell people everything they needed to know about whether we have hospitals in fact.  Surgeons in fact.  Why they want to claim to be doing open heart surgeries on infants.  How many they claim to be doing (whether they are doing anything in fact or trusting that growth will right itself and they just pretend that they are the heroes).  Ist hat the level of the facade?</p>

<p>What actually happened with the courts?  The lawyer filed with the Court of Appeal -- right?  Did the court of appeal refuse to accept the filing?  </p>

<p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/130817023/aunt-and-uncle-charged-in-connection-with-toddlers-homicide  Wow.  Yeah.  Another really beautiful little kid.  What I wonder when I hear about cases or situations like these is:  Did the caregivers ask for help?  I mean to say, was there an earlier point where they reached out for professional services or professional help saying 'please help us we are overwhelmed we need some help'.  And..  What was the institutional response to the request for help?</p>

<p>We say 'more people ask for help than there is available help'.  We say that many people ask for help, don't get help, and don't go on to kill anybody.  Well then that completely and utterly justifies not helping anybody who asks for it?  Is that the idea?  That's the defence?  The cost of not processing the f*cking applciatons...  Not processing the progressions through qualifications.  Not publically advertising jobs.  Not hiring people to work those jobs.  Not f*cking listening to the people when they ask for help.  The institutional response to people when they ask for help.  To record that they are weak and vulnerable targets for absue by people who are chosen to be granted allll the money to incapacitate as many as possible.  ffs.  Come on NZ.  F*cking hurry up.  Get with the humanitarian programme etc etc.  In fact.</p>

<p>'The risks were of unnecessary surgical treatments and "unnecessary exposure to radiation" from too much scanning'.  That is correct.  That is the problem that was identified with medicine in the USA how many years ago?  Therefore all the people who decided to invest in NZ being held or kept however many years behind chose to invest in NZ (predicatably) being held or kept however many years behind.  BEcause the aim is not to be first class NZ.  It is to be third class American.  Didn't see it coming.....</p>

How about children working the massage parlors?  Working as 'cleaners' of biological fluids wink wink nudge nudge etc . For not so much as minimum wage.
