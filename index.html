 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>So I Just read a news article that claimed Ashley Bloomfield just made Professor at the Univesrity of Auckland.  I am confused, though, because my understanding was that he was a 'Doctor' in virtue of a MBChB (which is listed in the World Medical School Directory as an undergraduate level qualification) and he does not have a PhD, or an MD.  That is to say he is not an academic and / or research doctor at all.  </p>

                                <p>They must have meant to have said that he chose to give up his three quarters of a million dollar salary per year in order to study for his PhD or MD because he *wanted* or *aspired* to be made Professor one day.  That's the only sense I can make of it.  I mean he doesn't have a PhD.  He doesn't have teaching or tutoring or grading experience.  He doesn't have publications.  Does he?  Apparently he has a Masters Level Qualification.  I don't know if it was a coursework Masters or a Research Masters.  If it was a 120 point Research Masters Degree completed over at least 2 academic years (and one summer school period) or something else...  I don't know how many weeks of enrolment they recieved for having him enrolled...  I wonder if he is full fee paying or if they gave him a scholarship.  Will his sons still be living with him and his wife in their 1 bedroom apartment living in University of Auckland Accommodation?</p>

                                <p>Just think how amazing it will be for him, decades from now.  When (if) he makes Professor.  He will be all, like, 'well, people didn't really understand why I would give up a three quarters of a million dollar civil servant salary in order to follow my dream..  But I made personal sacrifies to study for my PhD with the University of Auckland...  ANd then I worked on my doctoral thesis for years and years and years..  ANd I was soooooo scared that they might simply choose not to get my work out to external examiners at all because it would be so much cheaper for the government to require me to reenroll and reenroll and reenroll and reenroll rather than paying me three quarters of a million dollars per year to have an actual government paid position.  And then I got casual work within the university tutoring and grading.  Eventually I got my PhD and tenrure.  Publications.  And then associate professor.  And then, finally, the capstone of my career I was made Professor.  And all the sacrifices I made seemed worthwhile'.  I guess that's something to look forward to, eh Ashley?  A sort of reward or capstone on all the hard work you did working away on your PhD over however many years.  The sacrifices you made living in University Accommodation and living off a graduate stipend or some form or sort of government allowance.  Are you really going to enrol with the Univeristy of Auckland because you want to make Professor, Ashley?  When does your enrolment start?  Who is your supervisor?  Do you think they will get your work out to externals any time within the next 10 years?</p>
