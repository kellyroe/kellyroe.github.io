 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>In a competitive environment where the aim is to maim, weaken, sicken, incapacitate, disable, confuse, obscure, prevent, prohibit, obstruct, delay...  No sense can be made of medical treatment, healthcare,  any of the social services, really.  Education.  Justice. </p>  

                                <p>Apparently Universities were perceived to be institutions of social mobility.  That is to say you don't go to University to study Medicine - you go to University to marry a Doctor.  You don't study Medicine to learn and contribute to helping people.  You go to University to accumulate titles to accumulate money and power.  Apparently people unthinkingly listen to anyone the government chooses to bestow the title of 'doctor'.  That's the only value of the title.  That's the only value of the 'University' education in NZ.  </p>

                                <p>So what, then, of the people who were intellectually curious, and the like.  Who went because of academic values?  What happened to the knowledge and the like? Well...  New Zealand is the exclusion zone when it comes to science and technology.   What would we do with science and technology?  We see what our autocratic government chooses to do with the limited amounts of science and technology they have.  How they chose to use social media to try and influence the people etc.  We see what they think it means to be 'science led' (where the only science the government will fund spouts the party line).</p>

                                <p>My mistake was that I genuinely believed New Zealand to be a nation that was 'rule by law' and that was also part of the 'free world'.  I thought that I could choose what I wanted to do with my life and that I could earn that by some combination of natural ability and hard work.  But I have learned that New Zealand does not have claim to be rule by law (not insfoar as I can see) and the centralized government (else figures within the Universities) decide what programme of study is right for you on the basis of things like preventing social mobility and so on.  Because it isn't about providing social services for the people, at all.  It's about exploiting the people and keeping them as slaves etc. </p>

                                <p>New Zealand has a lot of institutions.  They are institutions of abuse.  They hire known abusers to run or rule in the government institutions.  So that people are more accepting of low to no wages for the rest of their lives etc.  I think we maybe plan our workforce development around keeping our people as slaves and enslaving as many foreigners as we can.  But we will also import people who have been struck off registers etc overseas so we are quite the destination for people seeking the very long-arm of the law, indeed.  </p>

                                <p>All the late-stage abortionists who cannot function in Texas, anymore.  They might find a real niche for themselves in New Zealand.  People who desire to keep psychiatric institutions that are designed to be places where wealthy people dump their wives when they no longer want them around. Institutions of child physical and sexual and emotional abuse.  These are the people we actively seek.  I am not sure whether we do pay them or whether it is that wealthy perverts pay us in order to abuse the New Zealand people.  We will not prosecute wrong-doing within the Government Institutions of New Zealand.  They are institutions of abuse.  Helping me, helping me, helping me, helping me, help myself to you.  Is all that we seem to doooo.  In this autocratic land of New Zealand.  The exclusion zone.  </p>

                                <p>How long can it possibly take to be acknowledged as having  completed 1 year of research in New Zealand?  There is nothing here.</p>

                                <p>Apparently the University of Auckland is going to have a symposium on Maaori Cultural Views vs Science. I wonder where the call for papers is.  I expect the symposium at the public university will be by invitation only.   A few people want their kids to have good grades in science papers because they believe it will grant their kids social mobility and prestige.  Regardless of the content of the Degree.  It would be racist not to pass the Maaori kids.  It would be racist not to fill up the science classes with content that enables and allows the Maaori kids to get the grades that grant them the social mobility and prestige.</p>

                                <p>That's why the University asks what race you are and what Degree your parents have etc on application.  They see from your parental address how much money your parents have (they can assess the value of the property).  Then make sure that everybody stays in their post-code.  Like Brave New World.  With the kids conceived in alcohol, born into oxygen deprivation, raised on 'education' 'I'm so glad I'm a gamma baby' and beaten about the head repeatedly in the name of national sport and in our Government Institutions set up precisely to keep them in their post-code.  It's kind of...  Bizzarre...  To tap into the world-view of the think-tank responsible for holding back the development of the people, so.</p>
