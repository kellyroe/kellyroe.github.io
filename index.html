                            <article>

                            <p>
                            This website documents some of the academic work that I did for New Zealand, Australian, and American Universities.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I have requested the Australian National University supply me with the documentation they have on what supervision Kim Sterelny and the Philosophy Programme of the Research School of Social Sciences offered me and explain why it was that they gave me extensions and yet refused to progress me through the qualification and refused to grant me my PhD.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I have documented, here the work that I did for the University of Waikato, subsequent to that where I wrote for them a 120 point MPhil Masters Thesis and they went on to refuse to get it to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit them signing off on completion of that Degree.  They went on to get it out late requesting it be examined for the wrong qualification (doctoral rather than masters examination so it would be found to be 'too short').  They refused to allow the overseas based external examiner to sign me off and they refused to schedule an oral examination when he asked for that after seeing they refused to sign me off themselves.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I have also documeted a similar process occurring in the Courts of New Zealand.  They do not accept filings, they will not progress filings, they order case management conferences where the Judges instruct filings to be changed into things that are less likely to win and they refuse to progress cases through the courts.  

                            <p>
                            Here are my submissions to the Court of Appeal regarding the University of Otago:

                                <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>.  I post them here because the Courts say I am out of time because I did not pay them $7,060 by the deadline they set.  I post them here so you can judge for yourself whether the courts have or have not upheld justice.
                                </p>

                                <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings on grounds that it had already passed judgment on the filings and would not revisit the issue.  They did not think my filings sufficient to show there had been a grotesque injustice.  I post them so you can judge for yourself.  
                                </p> 

                                <p>
                                 Here is why I believe that New Zealand is a State of Australia (it is written into the Australian Constitution): <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  They do not progress my submissions.
                                </p>  

                                <p>
                                The Universities of Otago and Auckland are not being fair as to how they are choosing what students to enrol in Medicine.  I have documented how Otago unlawfully discriminates against applicants on the basis of disability (they are blatant about that being what they are doing) and I have documented how Auckland refuses to apply their published algorithm to applications.  That means that Dr Leeks wasn't the product of a fair algorithm.  He was hand-picked for displaying the qualities they have chosen to value.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The Universities and courts have broken the social contract.  The Courts have chosen to set precedent that it will cost upwards of $20,000 to take a case against the Univesrity to the High COurt and the High Court will not uphold Justice.  
                                </p>

                                <p>New Zealand keeps detention / slave camps.  New Zealand is a state of Australia.  Australia chooses to supply New Zealand Dollars to New Zealanders to prevent them travelling domestically and to disguise how low the wages are kept in New Zealand.  They will not pay the teachers, police, nurses, etc.  They do not value the lives of New Zealanders.  They keep slave / dention camps.  They do not allow qualification progression and completion.  They are not fair in their allocation of training places.  They are not fair in their process of advertising (if they even do) or appointing people for paid jobs.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Dishonest people live there.  They lie to prospective migrants and then they don't pay them.  They arrange for them to be abused.  They don't honor their part of the contract.  They don't progress the work they don't acknowledge the work.  They are not supportive or encouraging.  They don't acknowledge people's humanity.  They don't see people.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I don't know why Kim Sterelny chose to have a problem with me except that I was a New Zealander and he seems to have a chip off his shoulder when it comes to New Zealand.  I resented him expecting me to house-sit for him when he went out of town with his family.  I resented being expected to go to conferences or workshops where I was to listen only and never to present.  I was not happy with how he never asked to see my work (unless it was to crap all over it the night before a presentation).  He never asked to see my written work.  He never gave me concrete and specific suggestions for changes to be made.  He never signed off on anything.  He wrote for me to be given extensions.  he wrote for me to be given scholarships to travel.  But he would not write for me to be signed off and he would not get my work to examiners.  I never wanted him to chase me.  He never invited me to meet with him.  He was paid to supervise me.  I don't know how much money he was paid to supervise me.  Then I'm expected to leave the University without my Degree and keep sending him work and they don't pay me.  And I keep sending him work.  And they don't pay me.  They pay him.  They pay him to supervise me.  Where is my Degree?
                                </p>

                                New Zealand doesn't really have a health system.  It seems that there are few specialists who are acknowledged as such and they are basically traffickign vast sums of money out of the DHBs if they have their husband or wife or sister or brothers second cousin who awards them the external contracts to do the work (or enrol everyone in the control group of an experiment).  The New Zealand Medical Councils and Specialist Councils are just a way of Australia refusing to acknowledge the NZ specialists.  They will never pay them to do that work.  We don't have a training system.  Australia hardly or barely does.  They don't have design plans for vaccine or submarine or satellite...  New Zealand doesn't want trained builders.  It wants young people to destroy their bodies working construction with plans to deport them or fail them out of their 'apprenticeship' when it's time to pay them.  They will not pay the workers.  They will not invest anything in training.  They will not acknowledge the value of anything other than slave-driving or slave-owning.  They don't want people to have health-care etc.  They think they have a private system where a certain special class of people in Australasia is treated better.  But, as they say in Public Health, the people aren't in the position to be able to tell.  You might get fancier reception areas and so on but the quality of the healthcare...  People aren't in the position to be able to tell.  There's nothing there....  Worse... People grab up all the money in return for ensuring things never develop.  They used to say to me 'you will be waiting for various people to die before there will be a job for you.'  Yes.  That's what it feels like.  My job is waiting for y'all to die.  That's the world that you made.  I don't know why they wont share.  I guess they don't think they will get sick.  Or something.  I don't know.  I suppose they are too busy enjoying all of their money to think much of anything at all.

                                <p> Here is a link to how sorry he is that several of his (New Zealand) former students still do not have jobs in the field.  And how sorry he is that I didn't get my PhD (no point when there are no jobs for New Zealanders):  <a href="judicial-review/kim.pdf" target="_self"> No jobs for you - but lots of money for me. </a>
                                </p>  

                                <p>Apparently I'm irrational, unreasonable, and too old.  I'm so irrational and unreasonable  and old that the Australian National University wouldn't even take my money as a full fee paying student and give me a PhD for work I did as a full fee paying studnet!  That's how irrational and unreasonable I am being.  It is not about the money, then.  I don't know how the VC of the ANU would feel about Sterelny advising students who were successful Summer Research Scholars and recipients of Australian Research Awards that the Australian National University would not even take their money if they were to full fund their own PhD!  Not just no job for me in Philosophy --  He wouldn't even be supportive of my doing vocational training to become qualified to do something that there is a global sortage of.  Apparently there is a global shortage of Psychiatrists and specialist physicians including surgeons.  But I'm certainly not allowed to train to be one.  I'm to be kept in poverty with no job.  That's what Australiasia most wants.  That's what they most value.  That's the point or the purpose or the aim or the goal or the plan.  To not train a workforce.  To not acknowledge trained workers.  It's sooooooooo competitive.  All the things they do not have.  Design plans.  Vaccines.  Submarines.  Satellites.  'The Evolved Apprentice'.  You pay peanuts you get monkeys.  You get 1 million monkeys to type for 1 million years and you get the works of Shakespeare.  The ideology goes.  Plans for Nuclear Submarines will just fall out of the post-modernist essay generator.  Students will copy-paste them together from bits they find on Google.  It's not humane.  But who values humanity?  Nobody even valued good science.  They don't even value getting good at science.  Atrocities are required.  You need to start by keeping 1 million monkeys and then...
