                                <p>When I get some time I will try and make light and dark themes my first Javascript project.  I think people have strong preferences either way on the color scheme thing, and I was looking for My First Javascript Project.  So, that might be a nice one.</p>

                                <p> Thanks for bearing with me while I am working through readability issues and figuring out color options. </p>
           
                                <p>You can contact me via the email address: email@kellyroe.org.
                                Yes, you probably read that correctly, 
                                my email address starts with the word "email".
                                I'll let you copy-paste that into whatever email programme you like.

                            <p>Where things are up to with the courts.  I am trying to have the substantive judgments of the High Court heard in the Court of Appeal.  I think that if you read many of the High Court Judgments that come out of the High Court of NZ you will get the sense or the feeling that things read strangely and justice has not been done, yet.  At least, that is how I feel when I read High Court Judgments about cases where I don't know anything more than what is actually present or contained within that High Court Judgment.</p>

                            <p>
                            When I read the Judgments of the Court of Appeal they often read considerably better.  They sound fairer, if that makes sense.  And often the substantive judgment is overturned.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I used to ask other people for help and advice, basically trusting that people were supportive and helpful and kind.  I have come to see that other people seem more interested in encouraging me to give up and settle for nothing and so on, however.  So I don't listen to other people anymore.  I started out asking for legal advice and remember being berated, really, by a legal advice person that I should just pay additional fees to the University for re-enrolment.  Just pay your fees.  Just pay your fees.  Just pay more fees.  Maybe because that's what she had to do in order to get her law degree.  I don't know.But I don't ask for help from within New Zealand anymore.</p>

                            <p>
                            In order to have a case heard on appeal you need to (1) file and serve an application (2) pay the filing fee or apply for it to be waived (3) apply for a hearing (4) pay a fee for the hearing and it is usual, also, for security for costs to be paid into a trust.  These things are supposed to happen within 20 days of the High Court Judgment else the appeal is deemed to have been abandoned.  But you can apply for extensions of time from the courts.  I have been prompt with my filings and my applications for waiver of fees but required to apply for extra time while the court determined whether or not the fees would be waived.  Then the judgment of the court that they not be waived could itself be appealed.  In this manner things have been forced to become 'meta' while I apply for extension after extension after extension of time to have the case heard on appeal.
                            </p>

                            <p>I am told things like the case lacks genuine merit and that's why they are declining to waive fees.  I am told the issues I bring are personal only to me and are of no public importance.  I am told the case lacks genuine merit.  I am told the case would not be brought by anyone who was reasonable or anyone who was financially solvent.  I am told I am not poor enough for waiver.  I am told I have not provided evidence of poverty enough for waiver.  I am told my evidence of poverty is not recent enough to make me eligible for waiver.  I am told if I don't pay the fee then I am voluntarily choosing to abandon the cases.</p>

                            <p>I think it is of considerable public interest how NZ Universities (they trade as that to obscure that they are the New Zealand Vice Chancellor's Committee where the New Zealand Vice Chancellor's Committee has statutory functions) do not investigate complaints  by students or require individual Universities of NZ be fair in how they deal with their students.  I am thinking particularly around fairness in selection, grading, and award of qualifications.  There are international practices around blind practices so that irrelevant factors not be taken into account.  We simply refuse to engage in internationally accepted best practice.  So we need to think about what it means to have a qualification from a NZ University.  And people need to think very carefully about whether they want to choose to invest in NZ University education when they refuse to allow students to work to internationally accepted standards of scholarship because they think it is entirely at the discretion of local people (e.g., the supervisor and committees within the University) whether or not the Degree is awarded and they are making these decisions on non-academic grounds in order to keep slaves.  Basically.  Force re-enrolment, force collection of more fees.  Force additional (unpaid or poorly paid) labor.  And if you complain -- why then you can go slave for the courts.  Right?  Just one more filing -- okay?  Otherwise you voluntarily choose to abandon justice.  Right?  Would you like to do business with New Zealand?

                            New Zealand is really renowned, internationally, for refusing to pay it's workers.  The people are supposed to sit about all day singing the praises of too many chiefs.  Apparently the reason why you want to be 'doctor' is becuase if you are called 'doctor' then people will listen to you and copy what you say.  So, you spend your time doing what your supervisor and so on says.  Replacing your words with their words.  Saying only things they approve of your saying.  Then, in exchange, they call you 'doctor' and you can be trusted to tell a tribe or a group or a mob what the government says you should say with the intention that the people will do as you say and copy you.  So, if you say what the government wants you to say about vaccination, let's say, then the government might choose you to be 'doctor' and have a tribe of people who do what you say when you say because you do what the government says when it says.  That's what it means to be 'doctor' in New Zealand.  To be chosen to be leader, like that, and for those reasons.  So you can see it does not matter if you are a doctor or acting or a doctor of gemstones and mines or a doctor of medicine or a doctor of con-munications.  It's all the same thing.  Herr doktor.  You want the pile to be how high?
