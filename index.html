                                The Constitution of Australia explicitly says that New Zealand is a State of Australia.  Australia now wants to say that they don't regard New Zealand to be a State of Australia.  They have granted New Zealand 'Soverignty' by which they mean New Zealanders are not allowed to vote in Australian Federal Elections.  New Zealanders are not considered for Australian Government or Defence Jobs.  New Zealanders are not considered for Australian Student Loans or certain 'High Value' programmes of study.  New Zealanders are not eligible for Australian Pensions or Welfare etc.  There is supposed to be a process for changing the Australian Constitution, if they want to do that.  They say that New Zealand does not consent to being a State of Australia. But they won't let the people say what the people want because they aren't eligible to have their opinion considered.  Nobody in their right mind would want to be an Australian Citizen, clearly.  I suppose that is why there is no point putting the issue to the vote.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Apparently the problem is that I don't speak English.  See, when the Australian Constitution says that New Zealand is a State of Australia the Constitution means to say that New Zealand is not a State of Australia.  Yes.  Kdithiehtdkgjhfkgf.  Word salad.  Word salad.  Word salad.

                                In 2021 The Australian National University declined my application to enrol in a PhD in Philosophy on grounds that my application was 'incomplete' because they did not accept that I supplied to them a writing sample with my application.  Also because they said I did not supply a research proposal.  In fact I did supply a writing sample to them.  I provided a link to my 'Writing' page where you can see for yourself there are a number of writing samples including writing samples of PhD and Masters length theses and a Book Chapter from Oxford University Press.  It's sooooooo competitive.  It must be.  The work you need to produce for the Univesrsity before you are even allowed to START a PhD!!!  Oh my!!!  Or maybe it's completely unrelated.  I suppose you look at the writing samples provided by the students who got the offers of place. If they were even required to provide them, at all.  If they were required to purchase them from a third party or provided them by their supervisor or whatever back home.  Maybe appropriating someone else's work is a necesseary prerequisite for entry, these days.  You know, get studnets uploading their work to Turnitin so that other studnets can purchase their work from the system.  More convenient than having people living in in the frat houses to do the work of everybody in the frat, I suppose. I also have an email from Kim Sterelny saying that I was not to write a research proposal with my application to enrol.  I informed him that I was going to include a research proposal with my application (despite his really very high quality advice) and I said that I didn't really want to start all over again on a PhD with the Australian National University when they didn't seem to have the willingness and / or ability to actually process any of the work that they had received from me already.  How about a little credit for the work that I had done?  If I was to do more research it would be on the notion of 'consent' in Medicine.  Basically on how Australia does not seem to have a handle on the notion of consent.  Not when it comes to being a citizen of Australia and not when it comes to being a victim of the 'health' system, either.

                                <p>  The Vice Chancellor has directed me to complain to two separate Deans, now.  Apparently they are progressing my complaint -to no particular time-frame.  I give them 25 working days (very generous) before I complain to the courts.  ffs.  Nobody can function.  Tell the world, then, Australia, how you refuse to have a functioning judiciary (also health system also education system).  How f*cking tiresome.  I post this here so that you can make an informed decision whether you want to study with the Australian National University or whether you want to train or work in Australia.  Whether you consider how they have treated me to be fair or appropriate conduct.  What that means for the value of your own qualifications or university affiliation etc.  The Australian National University is not a private university.  It is a Public University of Australia.  It is supposed to be the premier research university.  Look into the quality of the supervision they provide and their willingness and / or ability to process the work of their studnets in a timely fashion.  How much work are you supposed to do before it is time for them to credit you as having completed the requirements of a PhD?  It is not supposed to be that f*cking hard.  Consider whether honesty and integrity is something you value.  Or if you want to be a slaver with your own personal harem.  Whatever it is that you think your University experience will be like and what place you want to take up in the world.
                                </p>

                                The Ministry of Social Development has chosen to use a lawyer to represent themselves and to do their filings for the Social Security Tribunal.  This is to defend their decision to refuse to supply advance benefit payment to a person who the courts have ordered pay more than $20,000 security for costs else cases are forced abandoned by the courts rather than progressing through the court of appeal.  You can read the high court judgments for yourself and see how the high court judges (or whatever you call Justice Toogood and Mander who have been pulled out of retirement for the occasion) who refuse to acknowledge facts and refuse to acknowledge evidence and refuse to acknowledge the half of the education act that confers duties or obligations to the universities of New Zealand and the chief executive of the New Zealand Vice Chancellors committee.  Ms Roe is denied a lawyer.  She is to represent herself as a Mackenzie friend for herself as she appears before the courts in her own private residence.  I am wondering what the difference is between there actually being a court hearing with an actual judgement delivered by an actual judge and whatever it is that the New Zealand Government seems to think that it is doing.  Who is responsible for re-hiring retired judges?  Whose job is that?  What part of their job description gives them authority to re-hire retired judges?  Apparently judges are actually academics who work for the Government rather than the University.  They write reports for the Government to ignore.  So, for example, instead of judging on the prosecution of the officials involved in wrongdoing within the Public Universities the lawyers are to write inneffectual reports making recommnedations that will  be ignored about the situation.  I don't suppose the government would pay them otherwise.

                                <p>The Tertiary Education Commission defines a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  
                            <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a>.  Justice Toogood was wrong to have asserted that I tried to complete the qualification 'early' or 'under-time'.  Error of fact.  I tried to submit it so that the customary or standard 3 months of external examination and up to 10 weeks of minor changes (typos and grammar) could be fixed up so that the hardcopy could be lodged in the library at the 34 week mark.  That is not 'early'.  That is on time.  The Universities of New Zealand (also the judiciary) don't appear to know what it is or means to get work done on time.  They refuse to allow it.  They aren't a University -- they are a detention camp.  It isn't only that they bully people into not completing their work -- it is that if you do complete your work they won't acknowledge it or progress it or process it.  When you don't do what the bullies want then you see how they choose to engage in criminal conduct to further their cause.  The bullying problem that New Zealand has is really just a front for the corruption problem that New Zealand has.  
                            </p>

                            <p>The University of Waikato offers a 120 point MPhil qualification.  That means it has been approved by the TEC as being 'right sized'.  The academic quality and integrity people, the NZVCC approved the qualification.  It is listed in the University Calendar.  I applied to be enrolled in it.  The University refuses to allow anybody to complete that qualification, however.  They believe they are entitled to require studnets to work for at least 12 months on their thesis before undergoing an external examination period of up to 3 months.  Since you are required to be enrolled at the end of the external examination period that means that if the examination period takes 3 months then you are required to be enrolled in and pay fees for an enrolment period of 12 months plus 3 months for a total of 15 months.  But it doesn't stop there.  They believe that if the external examiners say anything about changes needing to be made to the substance (e.g., a referene to be added, a section to be moved around) then they are entitled to require the studnet to re-enrol for an additional 6 months and also undergo another external examination period of up to 3 months.  That means another 9 months added.  Basically forcing the student to repeat the f*cking year.  They say that the outcome of what they like to call 'first examination' is always that the student is required to pay fees for another 9 months.  This is fairly inevitable.  That is to say, they offer the 120 point qualification with the expectation that students will end up working for at least 12 months plus 3 months plus 6 months plus 3 months for a total of 24 months (2 years).  What happens then depends a  bit on the university.  Waikato has this 'option' for the university administration whereby the studnet takes another 2 1/2 months to make minor changes.  Find another reference.  Move a comma.  Etc.  The University administration believe they have discretion to force this -- else they can say the student failed to meet their requirements and the qualification is withheld.

                            <p>Here is how much the Inland Revenue now says I owe the New Zealand Government for my 'Education' and 'Training' that are not acknowledged because New Zealand qualifications apparently expire 5 years post-graduation (well, not the Judges law degrees, apparently, but my qualifications have expired): 
  
                            <a href="judicial-review/ird-shot.pdf" target="_self"> $104,663.</a>

                            They have not provided a break-down of what courses they recorded me as having been enrolled in, in what year.  I have transcripts for some years that I will upload.  They acknowledge that I have completed BA(hons) and an MA (I can't tell whether they invoiced 1 year or 2 years or more of fees total for the MA - it looks to me from my transcript that they may have double-billed).  They refuse to acknowledge that I have completed anything since then.  They keep invoicing my student loan -- for courses that I never applied to be enrolled in (changing enrolment dates for more billings for them which make me look like I'm slow).  They take my research work, particularly, and give it to third parties without crediting me (or paying me).  
                            </p>

                            <p>The Education and Training Act 2020 (and previous iterations of the Act) all state that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible to be enrolled in whatever programme they apply to.  The Act states that when a programme is over-subscribed (more applicants than available places) then the University may use a selection criterion.  The University of Auckland published a selection criterion involving GPA, UMAT / UCAT, interview score.  They informed me that they were happy to use the grades from my previously completed qualifications -- so long as I completed a further qualification for the purposes of 'eligibility'.  They said that I was required to complete the MPhil for 'eligibility'.  But this is false.  As a domestic adult I was eligible all along.  Justice Fitzgerald acknowledged that.  They were therefore required to apply their selection criterion that they published for the purposes of accountability to my application regardless of whether or not I had completed a qualification in the last 5 years.  Justice Fitzgerald was wrong to think that just so long as they can say 'it's soooooooooo competitive' they can choose whoever they want on the basis of whatever arbitrary reasons they want (e.g., selecting 'most rape-y' from whatever private school).  They don't get to decide who is and who is not eligible.  The source of eligibility is the statute and not their discretion.  They published a selection algorithm as to how they would select students in their competitive entry programme.  They then refuse to apply their selection algorithm. What a farce.  
                            </p>

                            <p>Otago, too, thinks they get to decide what students they will enroll in what programme for whatever arbitrary (including discrimatory) reasons they want.  They don't believe that international standards apply to them or to their conduct.  Look at the choices they make (e.g., Dr Leeks).  The untrainable qualities that they value.  Do you really think that Dr Leeks would have been chosen or handpicked to be psychiatrist if he was not willing to abuse children the way that they wanted?  They handpicked him to see how many boys he could train to be girls etc.  His reward for his service was to be relocated to Melbourne.  Fires and plagues and floods.

                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  They aren't progressing the filings. They are refusing to supply applications, refusing to process applications on their academic merits.  Apparently it isn't a matter of public interest how they pick and choose people to pass themsleves off as 'doctors' in our hospitals.

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  Demanding me to pay more and more and more money to the courts else they force all my cases aborted, or abandoned.  <a href="judicial-review/sc-eyes.pdf" target="_self"> Here is the Judgement of the Supreme Court that I am attempting to appeal on the grounds that it is manifestly grotesquely unjust. </a>  It is like they have their eyes poked out.  Our highest court does not seem to have the conception of justice, at all.  It was the courts decision to delay Roe v University of Waikato proceedings until AFTER Roe v NZVCC and also until AFTER Roe v University of Auckland.  The Judge for Roe v NZVCC made all kinds of pronouncement in his judgment on the matter of Roe v University of Waikato.  That is to say instead of judging the issue he was supposed to be judging (the inaction of Chris Whelan in his capacity as CE of the NZVCC) he thought he would weigh in on whether or not I had done enough for completion of the MPhil Degree.  Clearly that is a matter of the Judge of a different case to decide!

                            <p>Una Jagose doesn't seem to have the job of instructing Crown Law to prosecute corruption within New Zealand Universities, or within the Judiciary (where judges refuse to accept evidence and where the supreme court punishes people for bringing injustices before the courts).  I suppose that is why they pay her more than half a million dollars to do that job.  They pay her to ensure the job is not done by anyone.  Not by her and not by anybody else.  The fact she is in the job prevents and prohibits the job being filled  by anyone with the willingness and ability to do the job.  It seems there is no evidence that they will accept that would attest to corruption.  None of the invoicing information that I provided (e.g., 0.5 EFTS = 120 points = 60 points = indefinate enrolment).  New Zealand does not appear to have a functioning judiciary.    <p> <a href="judicial-review/crown-law.pdf" target="_self"> Blow off response. </a>

                            <a href="judicial-review/adhbinterlocutory.pdf" target="_self"> My request for permission from the High Court to appeal their decision to award costs against me with respect to the ADHB having chosen to file motion to have my proceedings struck out rather than the ADHB having chosen to stop with involuntarily detaining people in conditions likey amounting to torture. </a>  They refused to grant me permission.  Here's how it goes.  A person complains via the appropriate channels.  The channels choose to employ people to throw away the complaints and delay progressing them and refuse to progress them.  The Privacy Commissioner, the Disability Commissioner, the Ombudsman.  These people wouldn't be on Government Payroll if they did their job in a timely fashion.  Their job is to delay and obstruct and prevent and prohibit.  Then you complain to the courts.  The judge says that when I filed with the courts I 'forced' the District Health Board to file a motion to have my proceedings struck out.  That is absurd.  They did not even try and contact me to apologise or work with me to make sure that unlawful detentions did not happen to anybody else.  They did not have to file anything at all.  The actual filings say that they don't have to file anything at all.  The case may proceed in the absense of any filings from them at all.  They could have chosen to ignore my filings and things could have progressed through the courts in their absense.  They choose to hire a Queens Council to file to have my proceedings struck out.  But the judge claims that I forced them to file a motion to have my proceedings struck out.  Therefore $5,0000 in costs is awarded against me as punishment for forcing them to file a motion to have proceedings struck out.  Because that's how the costs work.  The proceedings are not struck out (they are stayed indefinately while the courts find reasons for me to be required to re-file and re-file and re-file my filings) and costs are awarded against me because the DHB is apparently substantively correct in their filing to have my proceedings struck out.  They unlawfully detain me in conditions the UN likey would regard to be torture and the High Court Judge awards costs against me for forcing the DHB to file a motion to have my proceedings struck out.  Gaslighting.  Who appointed this judge?  Jagose?  Who is responsible for his conduct?  Maybe he isn't well.  What a shame that he can't get the help that he needs.  Genuinely.  If he can't get the help that he needs then the very least he can do is play his role in ensuring that nobody gets the help that they need.  Right?

                            I am not sure how much the problem comes from America.  I'm trying to get my head around why Harvard would give Jacinda Ardern an honorary PhD in Law.  The best sense that I can make of it is that it is sh*t-stirring. I remember watching this tv thing where some woman was travelling to tribes and there was some meeting house only the men of the tribe were allowed in apparently for cultural reasons.  She offered the men money to let her and the cameras in so she could show the people watching TV overseas the inside of the house.  They agreed to do it for money.  She was then interested to how the expressions on the faces of the women of the tribe when they realised how the men had used 'cultural reasons' as something of a garbage excuse.  They were willing to sell out for so little, you see.  Anyway, it seemed to me to be stiring the pot.  Then she packs up the cameras and leaves, you see, quite the trail of destruction, or something, behind her.  Anyway, I wondered if offering a several hundred thousand dollar of value 2 year masters to a New Zealand student to study at Harvard and then giving her an honorary PhD in law was similarly stiring the pot.  Firstly, who was the 2 year Masters awarded to?  Was that publically advertised?  Who was eligible to apply?  Who was selected for that programme?  What work did they do?  When did they graduate?  What job do they have now?  In New Zealand?  Did anybody get the scholarship at all?  Secondly, it was an interesting way for New Zealanders to learn about the recent change to our abortion laws.  The fact that the abortion laws were changed, like that, with the public being ignorant both of the laws in the first place (that were never upheld because exceptions or exemptions are the only way anything seems to happen in these parts).  If something doesn't happen by way of special exception or exemption (that is strictly not allowed) then it won't happen at all.  The places in Medical School are filled by teenagers who are entitled to be enrolled in Secondary School and only eligible to be enrolled in Tertiary Study by way of special exception or exemption from the University.  This is as opposed to domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years who are entitlted to be enrolled in the programme they have applied to.  That means the University fills the programme with their special chosen excemptions (like an 18 year old Dr Leeks back in the day and whoever is the best candidate for filling that role every year since).  I guess that's how New Zealand gets to be the detention camp of everywhere.  I suppose the immigrants are forced to lie and cheat on their applications to come here.  That way they can be sure that the people who 'choose' to immigrate to here will fit right on in and be right at home.

                            The psychopaths are determined to make criminals of us all.  Of course.

                            The reason people don't want to have vaccination (or present for healthcare generally) is not because they are ignorant of science. It is because the Government seems determined to have psychopaths passing themselves off as doctors and nurses and the like in the hospitals.  That's how you get a workforce who does the work and keeps their head down.  Then, when it's time for them to be paid it's time for them to go away.  Right?  Maybe move them to another place where they can begin their slave labor all over again.  Good idea?  The prevention and prohibition of development programme.  Must have more babies.  To do the work and curl up and die when it's time for them to be paid.  The news says that the Alumni don't want 'Victoria University of Wellington' to change it's name.  I don't think they understand what seems to be happening.  The idea seems to be that in order to preserve the reputation of Victoria University (so that the qualifications of alumni are acknowledged internationally) they will stop graduating people who have met internationally accepted or acceptable requirements for university level degree qualifications.  The University is no more.  Not graduating any students.  The older generation don't want to graduate anybody.  If they graduated them then they would take their qualiification and use it to apply for jobs far away from the detention camps of Australasia.  And they don't want that.  They don't want to give them internatinally accepted qualifications.  They want to keep them slaving as student slaves forever.  Teaching them nothing they value.  The prevention and prohibition of development programme in how you get people working while paying the slavers.  If they don't want to then, well, it's about time to curl up and die isn't it, now?  Step right up step right up for your government mandated vaccinations.  Because they really care about the people living long and healthy lives (yeah, right).  At least all this helps reduce demand on the health system -- right?  I mean, how badly do you need to treat people (involuntary detention in conditions of torture) before they learn never to present for public health services.  Public schools.  The judiciary.  Right?

                            <p>
                            New Zealand isn't able to keep accurate records of the number of people with Covid.  New Zealand was unable to supply nurses to Samoa so that people of Samoa could have MMR immunisations that were not mixed with expired anasthetic resulting in wrongful death.  New Zealand is apparently keeping accurate statistics on who gets the Euthanasia drugs.  People can  be enrolled in New Zealand University for one month or more while the body is literally dead in a residential hall of the University.  I wonder how many people are curently enrolled in New Zealand Universities, who are actually dead.  I wonder how many people in other forms of State Care.  Residential care facilities and aged care facilities and the like. Prisons.  How many made up numbers of slaves in detention for more and more and more bilings for less and less and less.  All the work that goes into ensuring there is nothing here.  What's that?  1/4 of the people in New Zealand are illiterate.  You mean to say Chris Hipkins refuses to acknowlege half of the formal documentation that comes before him.  He conveniently can't understanding the writings of 1/4 of the population.  The policiticans and lawyers and judges can't parse the constitution.  We continually hear an endless succession of people complaining about the state of the hospital and health system.  People not being listened to.  Doctors not knowing (or choosing to) properly inform people and honor their decisions about what they want to happen with their care.  How would we miraculously be able to get informed consent for a euthanasia shot right when get pretty much nothing else right?  How the hell would anybody think that the New Zealand Government was capable of deciding whether or not you had been consented for euthanasia anymore than they were capable of deciding whether or not you had been consented for abortion or sex while living (as a minor) in State care?  Nobody home.  We won't train a workforce.  Jacinda can go say that all the doctors wanting to to things that wouldn't be allowed in polite society in the USA are welcome to come here.  Selling out the health of the people.  Refusing to list melamine as an ingredient if you are going to put it in milk powder.  'Milk powder' is not an ingredient.  Poisoning the people.  Refusing to do any of the f*cking things that they are supposed to do.  Nobody home.  Nothing here. 
                            </p>

                            <p>Apparently there is some question over whether Sam Uffindel used blunt weapon or simply his fists in the High School incident that he was asked to leave the school for.  I guess that's why he only made member of the National Party.  He probably would have needed to have shanked the guy to have made Surgeon.  Or Judge.  It is disingenous to say that the National Party did not know of his history and the type or kind of person that he subsequently grew into (the people he was flatting with and his conduct at University and, no doubt, beyond).  I can only imagine that it was precisely because he was that kind or type of person that he was allowed to stand as a Political Candidate in New Zealand.  What's that Kim Sterelny?  Ooh.  It isn't like they are doing anything worse than what anybody else is doing.  Right?  I mean, everybody is Marc Hausering their stats and similarly managing their doctoral students -- right?  If it's good enough for the graduate students of Harvard well, then.  
                            </p>

                            <p>So...  'Diversion' is the solution.  When people have committed crimes and you want to exclude them.  You simply 'divert' them.  That is not what happened to Uffindel.  In full knowledge of the things he was inclined to he was promoted and advanced in his career.  He was not diverted.  He was expediated.  Wereas I, on the other hand... Who has committed no crime and refused to participate in the crimes of others..  Well, nobody can read my applications anymore.  Apparently.  My applications, progressions, graduations.  I have been diverted.  I suppose you would say.  To make way for...  I don't know.  How are Ashley Bloomfield's boys doing these days?  They were doing their first year of public health from his house during Covid Lockdown - no?  Did their applications to Medicine or to Yale or wherever get expediated or diverted?  I wonder what kinds of sorts of people they have grown into after seeing how their father could do anything anything anything (break the law with no consequences at all) during the time they were forced to remain in his house.  I'm sure that's the recipe for productive and empathatic professionals.  Hopefully he's not bashing them.  I mean, what message are they supposed to take about how accountable he is to the courts? 
                            </p>

                            <p>I suppose most of the young environmental lawyers were put off environmental law after doing their internship at the firm you are supposed to intern in if you want to make judge.  That's how that works.  Right?  You go there if you want to make judge.  Then you watch the old white partners watching the young only Pacifica partner in the firm hit on the young girls.  You watch the old white partners watching the reactions and responses on the faces of the other interns.  Whether the baby lawyers look with longing at the guy for getting to express his power so, whether their disgust is appropriately directed towards the girls.  They were asking for it.  Right?  Silly skanks that they are.  One less competition standing in the way of the path towards becoming God.  Right.  That's the dream for all the baby lawyers?  Wear a fancy suit and get to do anything anything anything they want with impunity.  No legal consequences for their crimes.  They don't get to bow before justice.  They are Justice.  Right?  And the state of the environmental laws (and the state of our refusing to uphold the environmental laws along with most of all the other laws) of, of course, entirely unrelated.
                            </p>

                            <p>At least Jacinda knows both that this is the first she's heard of the problem and also that she already knows the answer to the problem -- where the answer is (of course) to simply deny any allegations of bullying.  She knows that there is no  bullying.  Of course.  It's both the first she's heard of it and something she knows without any investigation.  I suppose that's what she learned in all of those classes she went to at Harvard with her high quality lecturers.  What was worked out in all of the written work that she did.  All of the high quality discussions with her peers (not ones where they were required to be under the influence first).
                            </p>

                            <p>Something something about the highest suicide rate in the developed world.  Also 'suicide rate'.  Also with euthanasia drugs and no baseline signal on the Covid numbers.  Nobody prosecuted for abortion when it's a criminal offence.  Something something about the highest rate of abortions being performed when it's a criminal offense.  But that's okay because all the special exemptions by the Government paid 'Doktors' who..  Uh...  Graduated from foreign medical schools, typically.  The 'no speak English' defence.  People who aren't in Guatamala or India or Russia anymore...  Apprarently the NZ Medical Graduate Doctors are all practicing overseas...  I don't know what reason we would have to believe that.  Last I heard Otago wasn't graduating them at all.  I can't imagine that you will find them in England or Ireland or wherever...  I think you might find them dead in their residential hall...  Insofar as you can find them, at all.  The great hoax.  Huh.  THey want to say that what happens is that you pay the private schools.  You pay you pay you pay you pay you pay the private schools.  Then you are a person and they process your stuff and they give you a job etc.  But that doesn't seem right.  Again:  I paid the filing fees for the tenancy tribunal.  They then kept throwing out the judgment (ordering re-hearing after re-hearing after re-hearing) until they got a judgment where the judge refused to accept the evidence and refused to acknowledge the law.  Then that judgement was upheld only.  So paying the filing fee will not help you.  I think the idea/l is that you need to be a criminal psychopath actually committing the wrongdoing for the courts to find in your favor.  Is that the way it goes?  New Zealand does not actually seem to have a functioning...  Anything.  Anything.  Anything at all.  Not giving birth certificates to babies born.  Not giving people secure post-boxes for things like voting papers.  Nothing to see here, people.  Nothing, nothing, nothing at all.  How many people actually vote, anyway?  Weren't there cases of some people submitting multiple votes?  Not exactly even pretending to be a democracy.  The race to the bottom of who can be worse than who every f*cking election.  The whole 'there is no alternative' version of democracy where Hipkins thinks that 1/4 of our population can't even read the ballot papers.  Right?  How many full time equivalent jobs for how many people again?  The problem is that the people can't count.  As was shown in a graph explained by Chris Hipkins.  No doubt.  But apparently politicians aren't really politicians, anyway.  They are managers.  Of course.  Everybody is, in New Zealand.  Managing the administration of the managing administration of the administration of the managers.  National wants to pay some people to record that some other people don't want to work and aren't trying to look for work.  If they can record that of others then they get paid more and more for the more and more of those people they make (or make up).  Right?  That's a good job.  Writing down how The Vice Chancellor of the New Zealand Vice Chancellor's Committee doesn't seem to want to do his job.  He hasn't progressed a single complaint (in violation of his statutory responsibility to progress complaints so as to honor NZ's international obligations to protect whistle-blowers).  New Zealand would rather the babies be poisoned with melamine and if you speak out about the melamine contamination then you need to be punished.  Clearly.  Again and again and again and again and again.  That's how we deal with 'whistleblowers'.  We will not improve our performance.  Never.  Never.  Dying on our sword rather than listing 'melamine' as an ingredient if you want to add it to the milk power.  There's nobody home.  Nothing here.  Plagues and fires and floods.  Volcanic explosions.  Etc.  Plagues of f*cking zombies 'just following orders'.  Just living our their natures, apparently.  Doing what comes naturally and all.  The inevitabilites of evolution.  Of evolutionary biology of the evolutionary socio-biologists.  Sex and death.  The meaning of life, right there.  Brought to you by the people with speaking rights.  The point of old women is to look after their babies.  Of course.  
                            </p>

                            <p>At least the people are starting to understand that they don't have the right to anything in Australasia.  No right to health, no right to education, no right to justice, no right to anything, anything, anything at all.  The government doesn't have any duty to provide any of those things.  All of the taxpayers dollars for the government and none of the social services.  Of course.  Sure.  The job of the government is to take and imprison and abuse and ensure the prevention and prohibition of development.  No science, no technology, no arts, no culture.  Just communities of people living in conditions of deprivation and poverty.  Lord of the slums.  The worse your population does the more powerful you are, relatively speaking.  Right?  Isn't that the basic idea?  The whole aim or point is to nestle into your fitness trap all cozy like and ensure nobody escapes out of your local community.  Write no references.  
                            </p>

                            <p>I remember submmitting my MA thesis for external examination by the end of the day of 30 November 2005.  I was told I needed to submit it by the enrolment deadline if I wanted it to be examined and I was trusting the University to give me the information I needed to complete my work in a timely fashion (like how you get course outlines that supply your deadlines as an undergraduate student.)  But the thing is that once you get to graduate school you are asked to write your own timeline and the Univesrity says 'you will fail' no matter what timeline you present to them.  Unless you present the 'I will slave for you indefinately and pay the University indefinately' time-line.  Of course.  Because that's what University is or meeeeeeeeans.  You have to say it like that.  That's what is meeeeeeeeeeeeans to be a 'University' in these parts.  It means that no research will be allowed to be done.  Not on their watch.  Their job or role or function is the prevention and prohibition of research.  Anyway...  So my hardcopy thesis is supplied to them on the day they said I was to give it to them.  So, 'on time' by their own standards.  Then, end February...  When I'm trying to enrol in a PhD with the ANU (who said I needed to either complete or withdraw from the MA to do a PhD with them)...  My thesis from Waikato still hasn't been externally examined.  My ANU notes say that.  They say that the administration contacted the department about 'what they wanted to do' since Waikato Univesrity hadn't acknowledged that the MA was done and that was 3 months after I submitted the MA for external examination.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            In other words, the University of Waikato has been hoarding theses for quite some time.  Refusing to get them out to externals else allowing externals to take more than 3 months to externally examine theses.  They wouldn't get my thesis submissions of 2018 and 2019 out to be externally examined either, you see.  No research must be done by the 'University'.  I mean, the education act says the difference between a polytech and a university is in how many features they have from the feature list.  Universities are required to be all the things...  Primarily focused on research.  What that means, in New Zealand, is that since the law says the primary focus is research the people paid by the government to work those jobs must be primarily focused on the prevention and prohibition of research.  Their job is to make sure the job is not done.  Is not done by them (no journals, no sending things to journals, no publications) and is not done by anyone.  Nobody is to send things to journals.  Not on their watch.  Nobody is to get things out to external examiners.  Not on their watch.  Their job is to make sure that the 'University' does not do any of the things that are essential for Universities.  That's the 'education system' of New Zealand.  Chris Hipkins better be careful.  If only 25 per cent of the population are deemed by him to be illiterate then he is not doing his job properly.  His job is to prohibit and prevent EVERYBODY from having an education.  The judges and doctors don't need to read to follow orders.  They don't need to read the judgements they are required to sign.  They don't need to appear in the non-existent court-rooms.  Nobody home.  Nothing here.

                            <p>
                            I keep wondering if there is something particular about my work that had people treat me particularly badly.  I think that Sterelny took a personal dislike to me.  We never clicked.  Out of phase, or something.  But then I also would see things like how he reacted to the stories of how Kripke's students loved him so much they would do things for him like carry him to class.  And then he asks me to housesit while he goes out of town with his family.  And what am I supposed to do?  Can I really say no?  Relatively early after I arrive he says Paul Griffiths is in town and I'm to go with them for a drink after work.  I say I don't want to / can't and he says 'It is important for your career'.  I say I cant' afford it (I really don't want to go) and he says that he will buy me drinks (he looks disgusted) and reiterates that it is important for my career.  He was never sexually inappropriate with me or any other of his students so far as I ever saw or remember seeing.  That is not the nature of my complaint.  I shouldn't have to consider myself lucky or grateful that he wasn't.  The fact that there was all this social pressure to hang out with people and drink.  You didn't have to drink.  I mean, Dave Wall didn't drink alcohol.  He would go to the social events and not drink.  But I used to live at University House and the windows open to fellows and I remember on more than a couple of occasions I could hear the Philosophy people in the Fellows Garden talking very loudly about what they thought of me and the fact that I wasn't hanging out with them in the Fellows Garden when I'm in my room feeling sick that they aren't acknowledging any of the actual f*cking research work that I'm doing.  My primary function is not to housesit for them when they go out of town or socialise with them.  I really did not socialise with them much when I was there as a Summer Scholar and they knew the quality of my work when they chose not to give me a reference so I could study anywhere else but offer me to start a PhD in Australia only.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Bad faith bargaining, indeed.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I don't know if there is anything more personal to do with my work.  Martin Davies published about a 'problem of the unwanted prediction'.  I thought I solved the problem for them by re-interpreating delusions as expressions of emotion rather than reports of perception.  Martin Davies went on to publish about them being to do with the motivation system rather than the perceptual system.  So it seems to me that my work might have played a role in helping him develop his ideas.  I don't know why Sterelny judged my work on delusions to be 'unoriginal'.  Fiona McPhearson was working on Synasthesia and she went to a talk that I gave on delusions and then became interested in the topic.  She asked me if I wanted to co-author something and I agreed.  Then she said that she wanted me to write the first half and I didn't know what she wanted me to write or whatever, so I left it.  Then, next I see she is delivering a talk on delusions where she presents a lot of the summary material that I had given to everyone in the form of a handout etc.  Who or what else?  I don't know.  I don't read the Philosophy journals anymore.  But that's why I've put the work I've done on this website.  I don't know if anybody else is teaching the class I taught (from the material I wrote) or if the reason why they are so determined to bully me away is because other people have been passing my work off as their own or if they have given my work to other studnets to pass off as their own.  I guess I got to thinking about how Kim Sterelnhy was the editor of a journal.  I guess that means he got the opportunity to read everything that was submitted to the journal.  It got me wondering how many of the things that were submitted were rejected and then (once they thought teh author was successfully bullied out of the field entirely) given to other people to pass off as their own or their students.  That would kind of make sense of why they want to train the studnets to plagarise from the lecturers.  The students are to string together the lecturers powerpoint slides into essay format.  Type bits into google and see what reference google supplies.  Only be allowed to submit work that ranks high for plagarism.  Then the academics can cry cry cry that if they didn't pass Maaori students (actually all of the students) who did plagarise then nobody would pass at all.  Right?  The prevention and prohibition of development programme.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            So, I guess that's why the Philosophy of Biology journal got taken away from Australasia and now it's been run out of Penn.  Right?  That's the idea/l of it?  To give the students there something to put their names on.  Or the lecturers or the professors from there?  Is that how it goes?  That's about the best sense that I can make of why the University etc etc seems to determined to refuse to acknowledge any of the work that I've done.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            It is pretty clear that the University of Waikato refused to get my work to external examiners not becuase they were afraid that I was going to be failed by external examiners and they were trying to protect and help me.  It is obvious that the reason they refused to get it to externals was because they were afraid that the externals were going to sign off on completion of the qualification.  In other words, the University of Waikato believed that it's job (as a New Zealand University) was to prevent and prohibit the timely completion of the research qualification.  No research is to be completed in a timely fashion.  Not on their watch.  The information and advice they provided to me was at best unintentionally misleading (because they were ignorant of the TEC requirements  and the statutory laws) and, at worst, criminal.  They are misusing official documents (theses that have been submitted for the purposes of external examination only) and fraduluently invoicing (e.g., enrolling people in programs they are not entitled to enrol them in and refusing to enrol them in programmes they are entitlted to be enrolled in by statute).  They are double billing research qualifications by refusing to get work out or refusing to acknowledge completion until additional fees and / or additional slave labor has been performed.  They do not honor their contracts.   
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I thought the University of Waikato wanted to offer Medical Degrees.  They wanted to grow the University to offer Medical Training.  But they don't have the willingness or ability to process an application to enrol.  They don't have the willingness or ability to allow people to be signed off (by international community) as working to internationally accepted standards.  Indeed, they seem to think that their job or their function is to refuse to allow people to be signed off.  Refuse to get the work to examiners in a timely fashion.  I suppose the reason they hired David Lumsden is because he has a stutter.  They think it is funny that his students are forced to re-re-re-re-re-re-repeat the year.  But somehow it would be wrong of ME to point out that that is likely why they thought it appropriate or fitting somehow to employ him for that job.  There is a lot of that, in New Zealand. It's in the bag with Justice Toogood.  I can see the chortle chortle snort people thinking it's soooooooo funny.  Professor Glue -- someone's about ready for the glue factory.  'Prescribing' horse tranquiliser so people don't know when they are being raped.  And so on.  And as for me...  Well..  Chortle chortle snort.  There are the 'bird' Philosophers and there are the 'fish' philosophers and I'm to remain an egg indefinately.  It's destined because of my last name.  Right?  Hey, I know..  My ideas are forced aborted.  That's what voluntary means.  Voluntarily give up philosophy because...  What, now?  Well, there isn't any subject matter.  There isn't any health or education or meaning or value.  No consicousness.  No conscience.  No mind.  No truth.  Knowledge.  Justice.  Nothing.  NOthing to see here people.  Just an infinity of garbage output.  How long could it possibly take to complete 3 years of PhD level research with allllll of the resources that were given to the Research School of Social Scences, Australian National University?  HOw many years could it possibly take?
                            </p>

                            <p>My writing is on the writing page.  I have listed the years I wrote it.  If you aren't sure about it I have listed the conferences also, and provided written versions of my talk (I used to print them off and make them available to people as hand-outs) and also the PDF's of my powerpoint presentation.  I used to make those available to people as hand-outs, too.  It was really fascinating to see how the people on payroll would turn up to conference and be all, like 'oh, hehe I'm not even going to anybodies talk I'm just going to sit in my hotel room and write my own talk (Bill Fish).  I only came to this conference because the University pays my flights and I want to holiday for a couple weeks after conference.  Who wants to take a day off from conference and go sight-seeing?'  So motivating and inspiring to want an academic job as a philosopher.  Really wanting to be a philosopher for all the right reasons.  Party party party.  Students to housesit for you whenever you go out of town.  Brush you cats.  Buy food to feed them (thanks for leaving food for your cats after making a big deal about what kind of food you wanted them fed).  Taken over by psychopaths.  Indeed.
