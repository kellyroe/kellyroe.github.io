    <p>'One of the issues which has been identified by the network is that the NCEA results in rural areas are limiting the pool of prospective students'.  https://www.odt.co.nz/opinion/editorial/rural-gp-training-proposal-welcome  They are throwing away applications is the problem.  The Education and Training Act states that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible to be enrolled in the programme they have applied for.  The 'University' then throws away applications and cries about how they don't have any.  And cries about how there are too many which is why they throw them away.  And cries about how they don't have any.  And cries about how there are too many.  Cry cry cry cry cry.  What nonsense.  They are refusing to train a new generation of GPs because new GPs will get a job only over the dead bodies of the old GPs.  The old GPs have no intention whatsoever of ever retiring.  They will work up until the day they die.  Alllllllll of the payroll for them.  Alllllll of the payroll for them.  Allllllll of the payroll for them.  They will enrol teenagers because they tend to be wide-eyed and compliant.  It's fun to party party party with teenagers who will do anything anything anything anything anything.  It's soooo competitive the teenagers will hand over their eye teeth.  They will pay the university and pay the university and pay the university and pay the university.  And the old GPs will write up how rubbish rubbish rubbish and incompetent they are and document their crimes.  And the old GPs will take alllll of the payroll alllll of the payroll alll of the payroll until the day that they die.
    </p>

    <p>Rinse and repeat for everything else.  We don't have any teachers, nurses, lawyers, judges, police, plumbers, electricians.  It's soooooo competitive.  Nobody applies to do those things.  Nobody graduates from those qualifications.  Nobody applies for those jobs.   Nobody is on payroll to work those jobs.  Just a  bunch of 60 or 70 or 80 year olds on 3x or 4x the payroll while they take the outputs of the younger ones (who pay the university who pay the university who pay the university)...  The ones kept on government welfare (less than minimum wage)...  Take all the work outputs until the day that they die.  Apparently it's sooooooooo competitive.  There will be a job for me only over however many dead bodies.  Waiting waiting waiting for the bodies to die.  Allllll the payroll for them.  ALlllll the payroll for them.  ALlllll the payroll for them.</p> 

    <p>The thing about GPs in rural communities is that they don't want to pay them.  THey are only interested in having people 'work that job' from the position of them being kept or held or detained as hostages.  I mean to say, the plan for 'retaining a workforce' is simply to only give NZ qualifications to people who they believe will be unacceptable to international community.  Therefore they will be required to settle for whatever they are given in New Zealand.  They won't be able to leave.  That way they won't have to pay them.  They can keep them as hostages in the prison or detention camps up and down the land.  They won't have any option but to do what they are told when tehy are told because they are told.  Don't refer your people on for tertiary care because we have the lowest valued people in the world.  No healthcare for them.  Don't refer on.  Don't tell people when there is something wrong.  It wouldn't be responsible to do that anyway would it since the hospitals are keeping hostages and there aren't any doctors and they aren't keeping records of prescriptions and there's really nothing here...</p>

    <p>The courts have ruled that the universities don't have to examine studnets work.  They don't have to get their work to externals.  They don't have to give students qualifiations when they have done the work for them.  I mean to say the Univesrities are blatently functioning as slave prison or detention camps.  They aren't employing people willing and able to do research.  They knowingly put people on payroll with the intent that they will refuse to graduate students so as to keep slaves hostages prisoners.  There's nothing in Australasia.  Unless you want to be a slaver.  Prison guard.  Keeper of hostages.  That's how come they can re-deploy people so easily..  There is no difference.  It's all the same.  The keeping of hostages and slaves.  It doesn't matter what the laws are because the courts refuse to uphold the laws.  THey won't write fair examination scripts or fairly examine the work tkhat has been done.  They won't blind grade work on it's academic merits.  ALl the energy and effort and time and expense that goes into the keeping of slaves.  The lowest value economy in the world.  By design.  The leaders seem determined to keep it so.  The courts seem to think their job or role is to compound injustices only.  There's nothing here.</p>
