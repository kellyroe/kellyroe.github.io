 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>The Tertiary Education Commission defines a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  
                            <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a>.  The writing tab shows that the University acknowledged having received my application to enrol in a 120 point MPhil with 05 March 2018 start date by their prescribed deadline.  The TEC approved the qualification as being 'right sized'.  They have the statutory function of approving qualifications and checking that the enrolment period (34 weeks) matches the FTE EFTS (1) also the points value (120).  But the University of Waikato is keeping records showing that they are not billing students in this manner, at all.  Shelley-Slade Gully (their award winning legal counsel) wrote me to explain that the University intended to 'hold me under zero fees' indefinately.  I think the name for that is 'detention camp'.  It is like they've had their eyes poked out.
                            </p>

                            <p>The University of Waikato believes they are entitled to require studnets to work for at least 12 months on their 120 point 1 EFT thesis before undergoing an external examination period of up to 3 months.  Since you are required to be enrolled at the end of the external examination period that means that if the examination period takes 3 months then you are required to be enrolled in and pay fees for an enrolment period of 12 months plus 3 months for a total of 15 months.  They took more than 3 months to examine my MA.  I think they only did examine it because I had already left the country.  But it doesn't stop there.  They believe that if the external examiners say anything about changes needing to be made to the substance (e.g., a reference to be added, a section to be moved around) then they are entitled to require the studnet to re-enrol for an additional 6 months and also undergo another external examination period of up to 3 months.  That means another 9 months added.  Basically forcing the student to repeat the f*cking year.  They say that the outcome of what they like to call 'first examination' is always that the student is required to pay fees for another 9 months.  This is fairly inevitable.  That is to say, they offer the 120 point qualification with the expectation that students will end up working for at least 12 months plus 3 months plus 6 months plus 3 months for a total of 24 months (2 years).  What happens then depends a  bit on the university.  Waikato has this 'option' for the university administration whereby the studnet takes another 2 1/2 months to make minor changes.  Find another reference.  Move a comma.  Etc.  The University administration believe they have discretion to force this -- else they can say the student failed to meet their requirements and the qualification is withheld.  
                            </p>

                            <p>Here is how much the Inland Revenue now says I owe the New Zealand Government for my 'Education' and 'Training' that are not acknowledged because New Zealand qualifications apparently expire 5 years post-graduation (well, not the Judges law degrees, apparently, but my qualifications have expired): 
                            <a href="judicial-review/ird-shot.pdf" target="_self"> $104,663.</a>  You can see, then, that New Zealand does not appear to have functioning Universities, they appear to have detention or forced labor camps.  They won't progress or process academic work (particularly research).  They refuse to get official documents (theses submitted for examination) to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit external examiners signing off on qualification completions.  There is no skilled labor workforce, in New Zealand, because New Zealand has a series or system of forced labor detention camps only.  You pay the University you pay the University you pay the University you pay the University.  Maybe they put you to work as an actor playing the part of a skilled professional.  Then, when you are done paying them, your qualifications are withheld.  They don't print Degrees, I would suppose, because they aren't worth the paper they are not even printed on, anymore.  They have an online records keeping system, now.  Right?  So when someone asks if you completed your qualification they can pretend they never heard of you (unless you pay the University you pay the University you pay the University).  Right?  So they can refuse to supply transcripts to people.  Unless they are murdering wrongful death bringing rapists and the like. I would suppose.  In which case they will write them glowing references because that is what it is that we value.  Right?
                            </p>

                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  They aren't progressing the filings. They are refusing to supply applications, refusing to process applications on their academic merits.  Apparently it isn't a matter of public interest how they pick and choose people to pass themsleves off as 'doctors' in our hospitals.
                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  Demanding me to pay more and more and more money to the courts else they force all my cases aborted, or abandoned.  <a href="judicial-review/sc-eyes.pdf" target="_self"> Here is the Judgement of the Supreme Court that I am attempting to appeal on the grounds that it is manifestly grotesquely unjust. </a>  It is like they have their eyes poked out.  Our highest court does not seem to have the conception of justice, at all.  It was the courts decision to delay Roe v University of Waikato proceedings until AFTER Roe v NZVCC and also until AFTER Roe v University of Auckland.  The Judge for Roe v NZVCC made all kinds of pronouncement in his judgment on the matter of Roe v University of Waikato.  That is to say instead of judging the issue he was supposed to be judging (the inaction of Chris Whelan in his capacity as CE of the NZVCC) he thought he would weigh in on whether or not I had done enough for completion of the MPhil Degree.  Clearly that is a matter of the Judge of a different case to decide!  
                            </p> 

                            <p>
                             <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  The Australian Constitution clearly names New Zealand as a state of Australia.  They say that they don't have to honor the constitution because New Zealand officials did not turn up to various things and they did not consent.  I don't know why Australia would care about consent in that instance.  Did they care about the consent of the Aboriginal people of Australia?  Did they care about consent of people to be immunised or subject to medical treatments or experimentation?  If they want to change the constitution then there is a process for it to be changed.  I think it involves a vote.  But New Zealanders don't get to vote so the Australian Government clearly does not care whether or not the people of New Zealand consent.  New Zealand functions as a detention camp of Australia.  But then, Australia still seems to govern like it is a detention camp of the Northern Hemisphere, so...
                            </p>

                            <p>Here are  <a href="judicial-review/sup-court-waikato.pdf" target="_self"> My Filings </a>to the Supreme Court regarding the University of Waikato    
                            </p>

                            <p>Una Jagose doesn't seem to have the job of instructing Crown Law to prosecute corruption within New Zealand Universities, or within the Judiciary (where judges refuse to accept evidence and where the supreme court punishes people for bringing injustices before the courts).  I suppose that is why they pay her more than half a million dollars to do that job.  They pay her to ensure the job is not done by anyone.  Not by her and not by anybody else.  The fact she is in the job prevents and prohibits the job being filled  by anyone with the willingness and ability to do the job.  It seems there is no evidence that they will accept that would attest to corruption.  None of the invoicing information that I provided (e.g., 0.5 EFTS = 120 points = 60 points = indefinate enrolment).  New Zealand does not appear to have a functioning judiciary.    <p> <a href="judicial-review/crown-law.pdf" target="_self"> Blow off response. </a>  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            <a href="judicial-review/adhbinterlocutory.pdf" target="_self"> My request for permission from the High Court to appeal their decision to award costs against me with respect to the ADHB having chosen to file motion to have my proceedings struck out rather than the ADHB having chosen to stop with involuntarily detaining people in conditions likey amounting to torture. </a>  They refused to grant me permission.  Here's how it goes.  A person complains via the appropriate channels.  The channels choose to employ people to throw away the complaints and delay progressing them and refuse to progress them.  The Privacy Commissioner, the Disability Commissioner, the Ombudsman.  The other Ombudsmans should have sued the Ombudsman for giving them a bad name.  Underminig their credibility and reputation.  He chooses to spend his time taking them to court instead of doing his job taking the government officials to court who are refusing to do theirs.  I don't suppose any of these people wouldn't be on Government Payroll if they did their job in a timely fashion.  Their job is to delay and obstruct and prevent and prohibit.  Then you complain to the courts.  The judge says that when I filed with the courts I 'forced' the District Health Board to file a motion to have my proceedings struck out.  That is what 'force' means, the judge thinks. That is absurd.  The standard form on the filings says explicitly that they are not required to file anything at all (they are not required to file a response to my filings and they certainly did not need to choose to file counter-filings.  The High Court Precedent from Roe v University of Auckland first case management conference was that one of the two judges present instructed the Universities external counsel not to file motion to have the proceedings struck out because the most expeditious way of dealing with my claims was to have a substantive hearing of the issues in the High Court.  Then the next High Court Judge says that in Roe v ADHB Ms Roe FORCED the ADHB to hire a QC to file motion to have my proceedings struck out.  New Zealand does not have a functioning judiciary.  THey unlawfully detain me in conditions the UN would likely say amount to torture (the Ombudsman vaccilates a bit on this issue but me mostly agrees that what they show to him in his regularly scheduled visits again and again and again likely amounts to torture.  Again and again and again and still.  Every year.  Every visit.  Every scheduled visit when they know in advance that he's coming.  He gets to go and see all the people being tortured.  And he gets to write about it.  And the New Zealand judicary again and again and again and again does precisely nothing.  I suppose that is why they are elected.  And I suppose that is why the New Zealand Government chooses to pay them.  Acknowledge their qualifications.  Pull retired judges out of retirement to write reports on how it is that the Univerisites of New Zealand have (at least 1) person they are being paid to look after who has been dead for over 1 month.  I wonder how many people recorded as 'students' or inpatients of the various hospitals and institutions of the New Zealand Government are actually literally physically dead.  The University of Waikato maintained they had 5 MPhil enrolments in 2018.  I don't believe them.  I think it highly likely indeed that they invoiced the government 5x for my enrolment.  They refused to supply to me information as to who the recipient of various scholarships were.  I think that is becuase they were not giving the scholarship money to any student.  Corruption.
                             </p>

                             <p>It doesn't appear to be limited to the University of Waikato.  Auckland and Otago are not processing applications, progressions though, and completions from Medical Degrees (or likely any other Degrees, either).  The courts say that it is not a matter of public interest that we don't have functioning health or legal systems, in New Zealand.  The Australian National University is also not processing enrolments properly.  I applied to start a PhD with them, again in 2022 to see how they would handle my application to enrol.  They decline it on grounds that I did not supply to them a research proposal or a writing sample therefore my application was deemed incomplete.  But this is garbage as my file notes that they sent me show that they had a link to my webpage where the 'Writing Tab' contained many writing samples (as you can see for yourself) including a book chapter with OUP and various theses of various lengths.  I simply don't believe that whoever they chose to enrol (or bill the Australian Government for having enrolled) was academically ranked higher than me.  I see that most of the other students who were at the ANU around the time that I was, before, for PhD, went on to have received credit for having completed the PhD.  I don't know if they were all forced to work over-time for how many years.  It seems that I was one of the few who was bullied into leaving without having received credit for the work that I did.  I have posted the work that I did during my enrolment there on the writing page.  My ANU records say, at one point, that my supervisor thought I would be done in 6 months.  That that was the state of my work.  He did not tell me that I should submit whatever I had in 6 months, though, and he did not provide concrete suggestions to me.  He did not provide supervisory meetings.  He was paid to supervise me.  That was his job.  He did not have to do any teaching.  His job was to do his own research and also to supervise his PhD students in their research.  So he wrote 'The Evolved Apprencice' and stopped signing his students off (particularly the New Zealand ones) so far as I can see...  New Zealand just functions as a detention camp for Australia.  But, then, I suppose Australia functions as a detention camp for the Northern Hemisphere, so.  No health system.  No judiciary.  No functioning economy.  Corruption.  Is it the lowest rate of successful prosecution of corruption related offences in the developed world?  That's how corruption is measured?  
                            </p>

                            <p>Party party party.  That's a good reason to do Philosophy.  Sure.  Be a rock-star.  Travel around the world.  Have your students hanging off your every word.  Take their work for yourself.  Pass it off as your own.  Bully them into fleeing.  Living the dream.  What it's all about.  Being so motivating and inspiring for a new generation of researchers.  That's all the very very best of the reasons to do Philosophy.  Sure.  But, hey, it isn't like Australasia has functioning science and technology either, so...  The prevention and prohibition of development programme.  For sure.  Cry cry cry cry cry for nuclear submarines.  Only 1/4 of the New Zealanaders are illiterate, according to Chris Hipkins.  He knows how to explain a graph.  If he loses it his job it will because it's only 1/4 -- right?  They can't even parse the Australian Constitution.  They can't do math.  University of Waikato math where 120 points = 1 EFT = 34 weeks = 1 academic year = 1 calendar year = 12 months thesis writing and then 3 months examination and then 6 months re-enrolment and then 3 months examination and then 10 weeks of changes and then indefinate enrolment while the external examiners take..  I know..  The rest of my life.  Right?  How long does it take for the University of Waikato to acknowledge completion of 1 year of research in 2018?  Maybe 3 generations after my death?  Too soon?  How about the Australian National University.  How long does it take them to identify a writing sample?  Just garbage garbage garbage output.  Nobody here.  Nothing home.  So..  Work hard people.  Yeah, right.  I'ts a real meritocracy.  Party party party.  Gaslighting garbage output.  It's soooooooo competitive.  The University of Waikato would have had one studnet apply to do the 120 point MPhil in 2018.  Me.  And the job of the University administration was to ensure that I not receive that qualification.  THey refused to process the application for enrolment, refused to get theses submitted for examiantion out to examiners, they refused to follow their own regulations.  They refused to do any of the things the Statutory Law of New Zealand states their job description is.  That's the nature of the competition.  The competition is the race to the bottom where instead of people working to become doctors and lawyers etc.  People work to eliminate all the doctors and lawyers etc.  New Zealand doesn't have skilled workers.  It pays people to ensure that skilled workers cannot function here.  We don't print transcripts because they are not worth the money they are not even printed on.  New Zealand Universities cannot keep secure online records (why would we think they had the capacity to do that?)  They aren't even capable of coherent invoicings.  They double-bill qualifications thehy can't even keep accurate enrolment records.  New Zealand has the lowest perceived rate of corruption because we don't prosecute corruption related offences because we don't have a functioning judiciary.  We don't even seem to have judges.  Nobody has the ability to re-hire retired judges, so far as I can see.  The process for appointing new judges doesn't mean that Mander and Toogood get hauled out of retirement because they are trusted to do cover-up and there won't be any consequences internationally (what are they going to do -- fire them?  They are supposed to be retired already hahahahhahahahahahahaha).  Wow.  New Zealand.  Nobody in their right mind would volutarily choose to be born or be a citizen of here.  Detention camp of Australia.  Detention camp of the world.  That's what soverignty meeeeeeeean.  Yeah, right.  WOuldn't you rather be Sterelny's little b*tch, then?  Party party party with Sterelny and look after his kid?  That's the function of old women.  Right?  To look after men's babies.  The meaning of life.  Right there.  The only thing allowed to persist.  Huddle into the fitness trap.  Get really comfy.  There's no philosophy here.  No meaning, no justice, no truth, nothing.  NOthing nothing nothing at all.  No University.  No health system.  Nada.  Zip.  Zilch.  Zero.  They chose their special children (Dr Leeks and the various other people they thought would continue on his good works) and they shipped them here so they could rule over the land...  Cry cry cry cry cry for nuclear submarine handouts.  Nothing to see, here.
                            </p>

                            <p>Apparently the elite don't have to worry because people use the ring of Gyges against the poor and sick and weak people (who are not other elites like themselves) only.  The judges bow before justice when they are hearing casees involving elites, and everybody bows before them, otherwise.  They use the ring only on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.  They provide healthcare to the elites.  Sure they do.  Course they do.  Yeah, right.  That's what healthcare is.  That's what justice is.  That's what education means.  You provide education to the elites and work to stabotage and undermine those regarded as not elite.  Of course.  It isn't that there isn't any justice or education or health.  It is that I'm part of the out-group who has been ostracised or outcast as non-person because I didn't like to party party party, or I didn't want to take up my role of looking after your kids.  Right.  Sure.  You totally grasped the subject matter of philosophy.  Meaning.  Value.  Word salad word salad word salad built into the constitution right from the very outset.  You have been consented for euthanasia but you don't want to be part of Australia.  You want to be an offshore detention camp.  Course.  Course you do.
                            </p>

                            <p>And if there is one lesson we really must learn it's that speaking up makes things worse.  Right?  So now we expect to see visibly Aboriginal Australians transported from Australia into the detention camp that is New Zealand.  It isn't like we are removing them from Australia -- right?  We just take away their Australian Passports and ensure they never board a plane back to Australia.  The Australian way.  Right?  To ensure the prevention and prohibition of education and so on and so forth.  The Australian National University has evidnece that they refused to properly process an application to enrol.  What are they doing about it?  It's been brought to the attention of the Vice Chancellor who chose to direct that it then go before 2 Deans.  Apparently they are processing it.  But they won't agree to work to a timeline...  Here's the thing...  If you know that this is how they conduct their business...  Then I don't understand or see how anybody would or could choose to do business with them.  I mean...  If they won't progress my application (when they don't have legitimate grounds not to) then what is to stop them not progressing anybody else's?  I mean, why would you even apply there when even if they did accept your application they likely won't ever give you any credit for work you do or graduate you etc.  And what are we to make of the people who apparently or supposedly got PhD's from there?   No justice.  No fairness.  The great plan to eliminate humanity.  The great extinction plan.  Right, Sterelny?  I suppose that is right.  The best reason we have for thinking that nobody has nuclear capacity or capability to destroy countries or continents or planets is becuase they are still here.  If we actually had the capacity to do that we would have done it, already.  The world that you made.  I mean, how did various things evolve?  Answer:  They didn't.  There is no such thing.  Nothing to see.  NOthing of any meaning or any value.  Well done.
                            </p>

                            <p>What sense can we make of a person wanting to pretend to be a Medical Doctor, in New Zealand?  I mean, who wakes up and goes 'I want people to think that I just like Dr Leeks, in all important respects.  I am willing to pretend to have registration with the Accreditation System who thought he was so wondeful in all that he did that they covered for him and protected him and moved him to Melbourne Australia to further enable him to spread his particular kind of 'Medical Treatment' around'.  I mean, who wants to pretend to be a NZ (or Australian) registered Psychiatrist?  What sense can we make of this?  Who wants to be called 'Ombudsman'?  The New Zealand Ombudsman does not have a reputation of being effective.  The  best we can say of the Ombudsman is that he is sooooooooo busy that his office is overwhelmed by the vast volumes of complaints that he receives.  He is soooooooo busy that he chooses to spend his time suing other people who..  What?  Want to be equally useless and ineffectual in whatever it is they want to be Ombudsman of?  Word salad.  Indeed.  Where does the money go, again?  I mean, who is on pay-roll.  We are learning that we don't have Medical Doctors on Payroll doing clinical work.  We won't pay anyone to work those jobs.  We won't graduate anyone from those qualifications. We won't enrol people in the Degrees for those qualifications, either.  We have Medical Doctors doing non-clinical jobs.  Same with the Clinical Psychologists.  Waikato and Otago.  Right?  Waikato trains 8 per year.  Right?  From a First Year Psychology class of 2x250 students.  But applicants from other undergraduate and Graduate psychology programmes apply as well.  But the graduates from the programme work in administration and management.  Right?  THey will only employ them if they say 'clinical treatment or intervention will only make them worse.  Do not treat'.  That is to say they will only employ them if they won't treat them.  THen it turns out that you don't even need to be a Psychologist or Medical Doctor to be called one to be hired to participate in that employment.  The prevention and prohibition of the development of Psychology and Medicine.  Nothing to see here, people, nothing nothing nothing at all.  So...  Palmer.  He was a Prime Minister.  His son gets a 2 year Masters in Law from Yale.  He comes back here to devote much of the rest of his life to ensuring that Judicial Review of Administrative Action, in New Zealand, is treated as an archaic law with no teeth.  That is an important mechanism in New Zealand for removing corrupt or incompetent or belligerent government workers and also judges.  So they can make a big deal of removing them...  When?  Who appointed them?  That is not how judges are supposed to be appointed half a million dollars per year Una Jagose.  I don't think we can afford to keep you, Una.  Hemorrhaging taxpayers dollars on what???

                            I guess one of the issue is Clarke Gayford, or whatever his name is.  He's an 'Old Boy' -- right?  He seems to be at rather a lot of the Official / Private Government function party party party kinds of events.  Did he pay for his own personal flights to the USA to be Jacinda's...  Assistant?  When she flew via NZ Military plane to the USA?  Did the New Zealand Government pay for her flights and accommodation to attend her Harvard Graduation?  Or did she pay fees to Harvard for Gown Hire and the like?  Or did they give her a funding package.  Make her a financial offer for her (domestic?) flights and accommodation and transport to and from the accommodation to the University?  I'm trying to understand how these things work.  Or how these things do  not work.  The level of corruption.  I suppose at a certain point they flew commercial flights.  So then the dollar value of the flight is clear.  So then there is clear documentation on who paid for his flight.  I think he went with.  Didn't he?  I think her daughter went with her to the UN at some point...  That would have involved a nanny?  No?  Maybe not.  Maybe you literally are expected / allowed to take your kid into business meetings and the like and if your kid cries or something (takes attention away from the meeting -- right?) then that's just like getting phone call in a meeting.  Right?  It's just like getting a social media update?  An offer to buy 1 and get 1 free?

                            The Privacy Commissioner in New Zealand thinks that their job or the job of their office is to refuse to give people access to the documentation that the government holds about particular individual persons.  That is to say the government keeps documentation that identifies people as 'Old Boys' or as threats to them such as victims of the old boys, or whistleblowers.  People with a conscience who will speak up.  People who have empathy and desire for fairness and accountability and the like.  So some people find themselves with all kinds of things on their records.  Things that are blatantly false.  People will have it recorded on their file that they are violent criminals etc.  And then it can even turn out that that was a complete fabrication of the government.  But the person is stuck spending their entire lives trying to prove that the government completely fabricated false records about them so as to exclude them from meaningful employment and the like because there's some violent offender somewhere who has been identified as 'Old Boy'.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            So the Privacy Commissioner's job is to ensure that the privacy of individual citizens (that is to say the governments information on them will only be used appropriately) is repeatedly persistently always undermined.  The Government keeps the information for the purpose of 'in group' and 'out group'.  Most often it is used against the people.  They go 'in the name of privacy you can't access your health records of the records of any government department'.  They think that privacy is something the government has against the people.  The government has the right (they think) to keep false records about the people and the people don't have the right to see those records (or see how those records are used against them) in the name of 'privacy'.  Talk about garbage output.

                            And they do keep false records.  The Universities keep false enrolment records and false transcripts.  I have supplied the evience of that and the New Zealand Governmetn and the New Zealand Judiciary refuse to correct their wrongs.  They could simply update their records and put things right.  And they won't do it.  They refuse to do it.  They choose to work only to keep going with their wrongs.  Like how the Ombudsman simply writes how the DHB's continually keep people who aren't supposed to be in Government Detention in Government Detention in conditions the UN would likely regard as torture.  He can give them an intinery of precisely when he is arriving for his inspection and what rooms in particular he plans to go in.  They give him a guided tour of all the atrocities they are committing in the hospital.  He writes those up.  He writes those up.  He writes those up.  And nothing is ever done about any of it.  This is how we like to do things in this part of the world.  Not part of the developed world.  Nothing to see here, people.  Move along.

                            New Zealand doesn't have Medical Doctors.  They can't function, here.  People watched Shortland Street and were so motivated and inspired to be a philandering rich person who got to order or boss people around as he saw fit that it's sooooooooooooo competitive about who gets to play that role in the hospital.  That's what it's about.  Right?  It's about going to graduation ceremony.  That's the point of a PhD in Law from Harvard.  It's about turning up on graduation day and everybody clapping your every word no matter what you say.  No?  It's about just following orders?  The people have been consented for euthanasia or abortion or whatever the government says.  Right?  Otherwise they wouldn't  be on payroll.  They don't need a Medical Degree to be on payroll.  Will they actually register anybody with a Medical Degree to practice in NZ?  Or you have to be about exterminating the victims of the Old Boys club.  Right?  Covering for the crimes of the Old Boys?

                            Well...  What is it then?  I recently heard someone say that they got a Psychology Degree then went on to work for the Department of Corrections.  They said it was a pretty good job because all the Clinical Psychologists who work for the Department of Corrections are all pretty focused on helping the Department of Corrections Administration.  Of course they would be.  The only ones on payroll.  So you write reports all day about how this that and the other person wouldn't benefit from psychological treatment so no psychological treatment is recommended.  So there's more money for the administration party party party and no need to pay clinical staff.  Just the clinical staff who are good at helping the Administration of the Department of Corrections.  Good at doing what they are told.  Then you can staff the Administration with people who did not get accepted into the Clinical Psychology Degree Programme that they wanted.  So, people who are jealous of the Clinical Psychologists for having Clinical Psychology Qualifications.  Let me guess 'haha they think they are so smart we will teach them a lesson'.  Because the smart people all work in Administration.  Right?  Administering the funds me-wards.  The helping me helping me helping me help myself to you professions.  If you want to help people then that's an invitation for people to help themselves to you.  Right?  Hostages.

                            But it's okay, because everybody is focussed on working sooooo hard to be an Old-Boy.  Right?  They will do anything anything anything anything anything to marry into or have a baby (legitimate or otherwise) into that system -- right?  All the alpha people.  Superman.  Supermen.  A race of them, or something.  The elites.  So much better than everybody else.  Intrinsically valuable and so on.  Only people we need to listen to.  Only people with any kinds of speaking rights.  We have really rather a lot of foreign people in senior administration positions, in New Zealand.  At least we know what you need to do in order to get a quality reference, these days.  What it means to have a quality reference, one can only suppose.  Most desirable.  We love you so much we want you to have an attractive job offer someplace far far far away from here.  Why would we wnat that rather than keeping you as local slave?  It doesn't really make any sense...

                            <p>
                            I think about the most disgusting thing all year is Trevor Mallard being appointed diplomat to Ireland.  Was he really the best candidate for that job?  Or did people decide he was the only eligible applicant?  I think about all the people would would have really loved that job.  People who had studied and learned about the history of Ireland and relations between Ireland and New Zealand and on...  And you just redeploy someone who is a known problem from New Zealand.  For the job of Diplomat.  That is a job that would be a dream job to so many people for all the right reasons.  And you give it to someone who ordered the sprinklers be turned on protestors because they weren't part of the Old Boys Club therefore they were animals with nothing to say worth listening to.  With no speaking rights.  You appoint him diplomat.  What a f*cking joke.

                            <p>
                            So the MP for Hamilton West attempts to follow appropriate channels to complain that he believes that certain of his staff are not willing and / or able to do their jobs.  That seems to be the idea.  he doesn't think they are competent.  It seems that the response was to offer him extra training or counselling.  His staff said they felt he was bullying them.  He says that there was no investigation into the complaint that he raised.  They made the problem out to be his becuase he complained.  He felt that the internal complaints resolution process was not working so we went to the media.  The party then said that he was the problem for bullying his staff.  He said that he asked for their to be an investigation into the issue that he raised (and there was not).  They said investigation revealed that he was the bully and he was a problem for speaking up.  He said that he then asked for there to be an investigation into his allegedly being a bully.  They vaccilate between saying that there was an investigation and it revealed that he was the problem for both  bullying and speaking publically and saying that there was no investigation into the issues either that he raised or that the party raised about him.  They appear to be in the position, now, where they are claiming that they have the right to exclude him for being a bully (e.g., not inviting him to a meeting to determine his fate within the party) without there being an investigation into his being a bully.  Without providing evidence of his being a bully.  They are claiming they were justified in excluding him (even if he was not being a bully) for being a whistleblower.  They say they can't trust  him for speaking publically about how the whips and the party handles complaints (that is to say accusing the complainant of being a bully and ostracising them).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            And the truth of the issue is (pretty much guaranteed) to be something that could have more cheaply and easily been resolved by someone trying to get a handle on the things that he felt he needed to be done so that he could do his job (the things that he felt the officials were not competent to do) and figuring a way for those things to be done.  Maybe it wasn't the job of the officials do to the things he expected.  In which case that needed to be made clear to all parties.  Still, I suppose, in better news, we finally have found a job that is appropriately (rather than ironically) titled.  The whips.  Don't have the job of helping people.  Clearly.  It's about whipping them into shape else they are excluded.  I suppose the situation came to a head after Louisa Wall was excluded by the party.  The backbenchers can choose, basically, and if the party has made it clear to them that they have no prospects for advancement within the party then the backbenchers can decide it's time for the party to go, then.  The State Government of New Zealand.  More than a few problems.  Not even a functioning Judiciary.  The Supreme Court has decided that there is no public interest or merits to the cases that Ms Roe has brought before the courts of the Universities of Auckland and Otago refusing to process applications to study Medicine according to their academic merits (they are discriminating against applicants with experience of the health system and they are refusing to enter GPA information correctly according to their published algorithm).  There is no public interest in the University of Waikato refusing to enrol studnets in programmes they have applied to and refusing to enrol them in programmes they have applied to.  No public interest in them refusing to get theses out to external examiners.  No public interest in them keeping false records (e.g., double billing studnets for enrolments in programmes they never applied to).  No public interest aspect, at all.  The Supreme Court of New Zealand doesn't think there is a public interest aspect in the New Zealand Vice Chancellor's Committee refusing to acknowledge that it has received any complaints of wrongdoing about New Zealand Universities over the last 10 years or so.  When this is the agency that has statutory responsibility for investigating whistleblower complaints (and protecting whistleblowers from persecution).  The Supreme Court of New Zealand doesn't think that it is a matter of public interest that the Supreme Court itself does not think that it is responsible for finding in the interests of justice.  The laws are a tool to help investigate and articulate what is just in particular circumstances.  Like how maths is a tool to help investigate the natural world.  The laws are a tool to investigate matters or issues of justice.  That's why it's about the spirit of the law.  The spirit of the law being to uphold justice.  The Supreme Court won't even allow a jury to decide what they think is in the interests of justice if the Judges are too afraid or if it's genuinely hard to say or to know.  It is pretty f*cking obvious to anybody at all that New Zealand's decision to run detention camps (that they like to call hospitals and schools and universities) is manifestly grotesquely unjust.
