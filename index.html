                             <p>Pretty funny haha that the Massey Academics want to say that if they lose their jobs their graduate students will suffer.  Why would their graduate students suffer?  The graduate students are supposed to be working independently.  Tell you what, if the people payrolled to supervise aren't being helpful, aren't getting the students work out to external examiners in a timely fashion etc etc...  Then maybe it really is time for the people on payroll to supervise...  To be let go.  They don't seem willing or able to do the job for which they are paid.  If they aren't going to be helpful then get out the f*cking way.  Hey.  </p>

                             <p>The thing about them treating international students as cash cows...  It's not just about international students.  It's about domestic students, too.  The farming of people.  That was Stuart McCutcheon's ideology.  Wasn't it?  That was why he was appointed to position as head of NZ's supposedly premier University.  Because he had attributed to him a doctoral thesis about how the farmers cry cry cry cry cry for more and more and more government handouts every winter they won't feed the lambs they'll die in the winter cold every year without more and more and more money.  The unbridled greed.  The business model.  Very...  Silence of the Lambs.  Wouldn't you say?  Where is the research output?  Where is all the independent graduate student research?  The 1 year theses?  The 2 year doctoral theses...  When are the public oral examinations scheduled?  So that interested members of the public can go along and see the oral examination of the doctoral candidates?  What university ffs?  There's nothing there.  What a f*cking face of a joke of a f*cking hoax of a f*cking scummy scam.  What 'University'?  There's nothing there.</p>

                             <p>We are seriously supposed to think that the anti-intellectual governments of NZL...  The...  Relatively most un-educated government in the western world...  Our un-intellectual government...  We are supposed to think that Jacinda Arden is a shining model of intellectualism, now?  Because she got given an honorary degree for reading teleprompts?  She gets 3 fellowships from Harvard for a book she's going to write (and not a book she's already written) when she never even applied for fellowships from Harvard and she never did a 4th year at University...  It just defies credibility, hey.  What a f*cking farce of a joke of a hoax of a f*cking scummy scam.</p>

                             <p>Basically...  People won't share.  Only over our dead bodies.  Well, then.  The choices that they've made.  Something about doing unto others as you'd have them do unto you.  Well then.  You see how they've chosen for themselves to be treated.  Let them gnaw each others arms off.    F*cking psychopaths.</p>
