                            <p>The 'swiss cheese model of health system failure' -- where the swiss cheese is only 1mm thick (if that) with a hole the size of a cannon ball in it, where you move the cheese around to get the hole right in front of the target...  That model of what 'goes wrong' (inevitably) with our 'health system'?  Where we cry cry cry cry cry for people to work this, that, and the other job, saying 'I don't see anything wrong' else 'sorry' while getting more and more and more and more money from visa re re re re re re applications and the re re re re re enrollments and the re re re re refusals to graduate and the re re re re re advertisements on the paid clinical positions.  All the money and work that goes into ensuring that the likes of Dr Leeks and Green and Professor Glue are the Only Game in Town.  Trafficked around various communities and paid and paid and paid to facilitate their ongoing crimes.  'Sorry'.  Yeah, right.  Sure.  Course.  Better increase the intake on the 'medical students' next year so you can get even more money for re re re re enrolling them.  I'm sorry.  It would be inpolite to point out the stutter.  S s s s s s s s s s s s sorry.</p>

                            <p>Radiologists don't do the scans.  I mean to say, it isn't radiologists who walk people into the scanners or who take the scans.  Radiologists view the scans that have been done and write reports of those scans.  I mean to say it isn't the lack of radiologists that is holding up the number of scans that are done.  In fact, quite the converse.  Let's scan and re-scan and re-scan and re-scan -- and never have a radiologist view any of the scans or write any reports about the scans that have been done.  Let's just collect more and more and more data.  Because of why?  The harm to persons that is done from all the scanning, one can only suppose.  Trying to exceed the maximum lifetime dose of radiation so as to induce cancer etc.  Why not -- if you are getting away with it?  </p>

                            <p>Similarly, it isn't the lack of pathologists who are responsible for hold ups or delays in the numnber of biological samples being taken.  The number of swabs etc.  I mean to say you can collect and collect and collect.  The pathologist is supposed to study the samples and declare cancer or not (pathologists are meant to be the people who say whether something is likely cancer or not -- because cancer is a problem on the cellular level and the pathologists are the ones who study the cells)..  Whatever.  The dumb and dumber show, I swear.  Not really any point in explaining...</p>

                            <p>Trading as 'Universities New Zealand'</p>
                            <p>The Otago name and logo change reminds me of this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP1Atb8nAGY  The 'O' logo looks a bit like a sphincter (in honor of Dr Leeks, I suppose) with a macron over the top.  The new name is to disguise that the University of Otago is no longer giving out degrees or qualifications that are accepted or acknowledged internationally.  Correct?  I mean to say that the graduates of Otago Medical School are not acknowledged as being graduates of any Medical School at all.  Not in NZ and not overseas.  Is that correct?  That the situation?  The university has actually simply been closed down.  That seems to be the idea of it.  They wouldn't process applications to enrol.  They wouldn't get studnets work out for external examination.  What of the graduates (supposedly) of Otago who are presently working as graduates.  Either in NZ or overseas?  Will they all be recalled back to NZ to be enrolled in the qualifications they thought they had completed already?  All the supposed graduates of law.  Medicine.  All of the things?  What university?   That was Harlene Haye's legacy -- right?  To restructure it out of existence.  Not graduate any of the students.  Now she's off to destroy the 'Univesrity' of Western Australia.  Why?  I don't quite know..   Because Harvard is so crap it's the only way they can motivate and inspire people to apply to be enrolled there.  Did Jacinda actually apply to be enrolled there?  On the back of a 3 year degree from Waikato?  On the back of a con-munity college degree?  What that the idea?  It just doesn't make any sense at all...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjV7W9bO10  Oh, hey, don't worry -- I don't think they are giving degrees.  Are they?  I mean they can withhold degrees on the basis of..  Um..  Ur..  Hmm..  Unpaid library fine?  Being recorded as 'failed' for a population health essay (we don't have to grade academic work on the  basis of academic merits.  We have a 'yay' or 'boo' theory of academic merits and we choose 'boo you' you have learned enough!  Leave some learnings for other people!)   I think the students weren't acknowledged as having their internships signed off.  Some GP came out from Canberra and said not to sign off on any of them.  I guess that they needed to expedite the children of the Vice CHancellor's of the AUstralian Universities.  WHatever happened to the daughter of the former VC Of Queensland?  Did she get registration to practice Medicine when she never got entry?  Is she still registered?  She kill many patients lately?  I don't know...  Maybe something something about the pit mines of Western Australia...  I'm sure there aren't any occupational health problems over there.  Best get Des onto it.  HOw old is Des, anyway?  Where are Des' students?  Former students?  Did he eat them all, or...  ? </p>

                            <p>___</p>

                            <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/300955677/nz-election-2023-live-hipkins-working-from-hospital-with-his-sick-child  Aw.  And while he is there he will only be taking the DPB for himself (or similar.)  It's the public system, then?  He doesnt' have health insurance for him and his dependents?  No flight to Sydney?  NY? </p>

                            <p>Hey, just as well NZ has the highest quality blood that Melbourne chooses to re-supply us with.  Yeah?  We dont' know how lucky we are!!!</p>

                            <p>I mean, just so we are clear...  With the state of our health system, and everything...  The bullying.  The abuse.  The died in state care.  The 'there will never be enough for all to have genuine need met people cannot have the things they say they want / need there never will be enough to go around' we have to expend our energy and effort getting people to comply with vaccine mandates.  No you cannot have the vaccines that you have identified as being right for you.  We have identified the vaccine that you are required to take.  If you don't take it then you lose your government employment and we don't even care about whether we get your vote..  You are a dissentor who failed to comply with mandate.  Don't you understand what democracy in NZ looks like?  It looks like the government telling you to line up for shots that you are going to take because your government has told you to take them.  How many people died of covid before the government mandated shots?  None.  It was to prevent deaths, said the government.  The government waived manufacaturers liability.  Did the USA government do that?  That Canadian?  UK?  Ireland?  Australia?  No.  It was only in NZ that the NZ government said 'we waive our citizens right to sue for foreseeable wrongs and harms caused knowingly by the manufacturers'.  How many harms from vaccines has the NZ government acknowledged -- compared to the government of every other country?  What's that?  The NZ governmetn thinks that power is the power to force everybody to do what you want so you have all of the power -- and completely none of the responsibility.  What happens when government officials are pulled up before the NZ courts to answer to their refusals to follow the lawas of NZ?  (1) Judges are pulled out of retirement and appointed not by proper process to not see anything wrong.  ANd  / or (2) The judges cannot will notn see anything wrong.   F*cking garbage land.  I tell you what.  Jacinda gets an honorary doctorate from Harvard -- for what?  For telling the graduates that nobody would be prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus in NZ.  Was that the law change that the Harvard graduates voted that they wanted to see instituted in NZ?  Did they have a sweepstakes where people bet or bid on how much US dollars it would cost to have that law hurried through under urgency it's an emergency conditions in NZ.  To be announced to Harvard that it is done at their graduation.  To show the graduates of Harvard how corrupt the nasty little despot is.  For the good of the people, was it?  All the above.  For the good of democracy.  No right to refuse experimental medical 'treatment'.  You can't have the treatements you need / want.  You have been signed up for various medical trials by various people with all of the power and none of the responsibility.  F*cking psychopaths.  If that isn't what psychopathy *is* or *means* *by definition* then, oh, please, explain it to me.  Only 'treat' the involuntary non-voluntary non-consenting.  What health system?  What judiciary?  What democracy?  They won't even supply voting papers to people from the state of NZL.  NZL being the second named state of the federation of Australia.  They won't even supply australian wages.  F*ckign psychopaths.</p>

                            <p>The government agencies are being very forthcoming now about phishing and collecting up all of the information when one applies for a 'job'.  Do you have a disability?  What accommodations do you need / want?  What criminal history or background do you have?  Etc.  I think the idea is to hire only those who have a criminal record etc who lie on the forms -- so they can underpay and not pay them and what are they going to do about it?  I suppose that's the idea in psychopath land.  Look into who is applying for visa... See who will pay a little something something in order to have their application expedited.  There are enough psychoptahs in the world to say that we will only do business with psychopaths.  Then, once we've taken them for everything they have we can jsut throw them away.  Right?  They were psychopaths!  So.  It isn't like we weren't doing anything to them that they'd be doing to us if the positions were reversed!  Psychopaths only need apply!  We will have things no other way...</p>

                            <p>Is that the idea?  What evidence against it do you see?  They aren't appointing judges via proper process and the judges aren't upholding the law.  That more information or evidence do we need?</p>

                            <p>Have you ever said anything that might embarrass the ACT party?  Um..  Well...  That says more about them than anything else.  What does that even mean?  Who gets to decide if the party is or is not embarrassed?  I know...  THey should just get a blow up doll to be candidate.  ONe that says 'yes sir yes sir three bags full sir' -- or would it to embarrassing to have that kind or sort of a thing as the only candidate the party would acknowledge?  What democracy?  They won't even supply voting papers.  But even if they did they wouldnt' count the votes.  But even if they did the outcome of the election wouldn't be determined in that way.  Why would it be?  They can't even appoint judges via proper process.  But even if they did they wouldn't rule in favor of upholding the laws...  I mean, come on... </p>

                            <p>The point or purpose of asking a question like 'have you ever said anything that might embarrass the ACT party?'  Well..   Has Seymore said anything that might embarrass the party?  He's put his foot in his mouth at least once, right?  He's only human.  Right?  I don't mean something like beating the other kids with wooden bats or bed legs (must  have) or something like raping or murdering or torturing or...  Now...  Is Jacinda planning on having a baby if she's elected to PM?  She looks the cameras in the eye and says she is not planning on having a baby if she's elected to PM.  Was it 9 months later that she's having a baby.  That the baby is going with her into meetings of the UN.  That her baby is part of her entourarge...  Now...  I'm sure there is documentation on when she started taking her pre natal vitamins.  When she started having unprotected sex.  But this willingess to look the camera in the eye and be less than forthcoming.  Must have.  Right?  Let's have a test of psychopathy and only the psychopaths need apply.  Only those with the willingess and ability to shame shame shame shame shame everybody else into running away after accusing them of being guilty of the crimes that oneself has committed...  Psychopaths...</p>

                            <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/300950743/i-just-want-her-to-play-mums-fight-for-lowvision-daughter-to-play-hockey  Talk about the dumb and f*cking dumber show.  The ball in tennis moves too fast for any player to see.  That was why screaming or yelling was an issue.  It was unclear how much the screaming or yelling or whatever (in women's tennis particularly) was obscuring the sound being made as the ball hit the racket in a way that made it harder for the other player to assess the trajectory of the ball...  Here is the basic idea...  NZ believes in the opposite of meritocracy.  What it really wants is to find the most incompetent and incapacitated and non-capable person and thenn expedite them quickly quickly into the leadership and most highest paid positions etc etc..  Then go about cutting everybody else off at  the knees.  Nobody is allowed to be any faster or brighter or quicker than the slowest who was expedited only because...  The dumb and dumber show of course.  If someone has a disability then we will forgive them just so long as they don't have the capacity.  Like the black studnets of Harvard who get to say (honestly) 'the only reason I got into Harvard is becuase I am both black and I lack the capaciaty to have gotten in on my academic merits.  Various other black people who had academic merits didn't get in becuase they were black and they had merits.  They only wanted the black people without merits to be there.  Because that's how f*cking racist they are -- in the name of equity!  THey have to allow only the black people who make their own in-bred idiots look positively competent by comparison. That kind or  type or sort of ideology... </p>

                            <p>https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/on-air/early-edition/opinion/kate-hawkesby-the-same-labour-that-now-wants-to-build-roads-also-now-wants-to-clamp-down-on-student-achievement/  You just stick it into Google and it will translate it into (or out of) Te Reo for you.  Chat GPT could or would do it.  That is the point.  See, nobody can read write or do arithmetic half as well as Chris Hipkins and co.  That's why he'll still be on government payroll (hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars each and every year) well past the age of compulsory retirement.  After he's had enough government handouts to support a harem full of dependents for 45 + years he'll still be on payroll because nobody else could ever learn reading writing and arithmetic.  He was the end of the road.  The last of the educated people with education . His Mother was something something with the ministry of education.  Writing the exams.  Grading the exams.  Deciding that darling Chris had all the answers to the exams etc etc.  All of the everything for him then.  That's the value of our 'education and training system'.  Getting studnets enrolled from malaysia to do the work of healthcare assistants while they pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the 'universities' to get to rub ointment on various 65 ++ people's penis's becuase.  They, uh, don't want to do that themselves.  They best to getting on with doing that, then, else they'll be deported without their nursing qualification . Haha you lose.  Better luck next genration.  What health system? What education system? What judiciary?  </p>

                            <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/  Now his 9 year old son knows how he is to behave to be most valued in NZL.  Like Ashley Bloomfield's sons were told, on no uncertain terms, how Daddy was to not follow the laws with no consequences.  Expedieted into MBChB -- weren't they?  Who is unlucky enough to be given to them as 'girlfriend'?  </p>

                            <p>I remember when I was at Primary School...  My primary school (Melville Primary, Hamilton) had a swimming pool that was open for rather a lot of the year.  And that was pretty great.  When it was open the more senior students had swimming times scheduled for earlier in the day and the youngest kids had their swimming times scheduled for the afternoons..  There were male and female change facilities.  Things were a bit embarrasing with some kids getting a mothers or doctors or whatever note to not do swimming (girls must have their periods to get out of swimming was the assumption)...  And the change room facilities were a little embarrassing...  I remember people crowding around one student to protect...  I don't know why because I wasn't part of that crowd...  Early onset puberty?  Hair where other studnets didn't have hair yet?  Who knows why?  The point is that these sorts of things were in people's minds.  Fears.  And so on.  </p>

                            <p>I was also really really fortunate as a student of Melville Primary to be treked through at various points in the year, to swimming lessons at the Hamilton swimming pools out at Te Rapa.  I mean, we are talking Olympic Games Swimming Facilties (to the best of my knowledge).  I remember the change room facilities there.  There was an open change room (in the women's room at least) but there were also individual stalls.  What that meant was that you had the option of showering with your swimming trunks on (or not) and changing in the open change facilities (or not).  I remember as a young girl that sometimes 2 or 3 kids would choose to go into an 'individual stall' and change in there.  Maybe because they were actually sisters..  Or, whatever.  For whatever reason.  One could change in public or private.  </p>

                            <p>I guess I think that to my mind the option or availability of an individual stall (for whatever reason).  Male or female.  Or who knows who or why or for what reason..  It doesn't matter.  Privacy.</p>

                            <p>Sometimes people choose to stop playing sports because of the changing room environment.  I know of more than a couple male athltes who were brilliant..  Who quit playing sport because they personally identified as gay and they didn't want to deal with open male change rooms.  THey were afraid that if they looked away and kept to themsleves that males would be offended that they weren't looking at them (since they were gay that means they were required to get a hard on for every man)...  Or if they did look at them then they would get beaten up for looking.. They felt that it was an impossible situation for them to navigate as 14 or 15 or 16 year old boys..  So they simply quit playing sport...</p>

                            <p>The option of private change room facilities for whatever reason.  To take a piss or a dump in private.  Change your pad or your tampon.  Wash yourself without other people taking a look (to mock or bully or poke fun at for difference).  It is somewhat expensive to set up private change room facilities.. But the real resistence is typically political.  Bullying and abuse etc.</p>

                            <p>Here is the thing..  The gender aspect of it doesnt' matter.  I mean to say...  We can quote about the guy who says they don't want guys by stealth pretending to be women to get into the women's change rooms to impregnate the women once they have stealthed into them...</p>

                            <p>Look... THe issue knows no gender.  Now, NZ isn't any kind of alien or foreigner to women sexually abusing men.  Right?  Female teachers (for example) are often pulled up before the courts for sexually abusing or molesting their male students.  And the judges hauled or pulled out of retirement for the precise purpose of not being able to see any wrong.. Want to mock the idea.  Now, Dr Leeks boys had sexual responses to adult men because -- it was their fault.  We don't comprehend that a male erection can be non-voluntary.  Unless it is the judges or the judges pulled out of retirement, of course.  IN which case the dependent or person with no powr is to blame or at fault for the actions of their superior...</p>

                            <p>Look...  I mean to say that NZ has very high rates of female abusers.  So..  The situation really isn't one in which the solution involves appointing women prison guards of PE teachers or whatever to lord over the women in the women's change facilities (no gender reassigned women or whatever need apply).  The issue is usually about the politics that goes into ensuring that certain people do a needs assessment.  Then when they have figured out what the individual people want (seclusion or isoloation or communalism) to ensure that precisely the OPPOSITE is enforced!  Why?  Well.  Torture, I suppose.  Figure out what the people need for the purposes of enforcing the opposite!  Good job!  Well done!</p>

Oh they won't pay them!  They won't enrol them, they won't graduate them, they won't employ them!  They won't pay them!  They won't pay them!  They won't pay them!  There's nothing there!  Nobody graduated from the progamme.  Nobody enrolled!  There's nothing there!!!  ALLL OF The money for.. Uh.. Kim Sterelny.  Harlene Hayes.  Dr Leeks.  Dr Green.  Nobody else's appication acknowledged as recieved.  There's, uh, *NOTHING THERE.  NOBODY HOME*</p>

                            <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/132695097/nicotine-lozenges--the-hottest-currency-inside-the-countrys-prisons  The problem is that there never will be enough nicotine lozenges (cigarettes, money etc etc) for people to have genuine need met.  Never will be enough.  That's the basic principle of economics that you need to get into or get through your thick skull.  The foundation of economics is:  Deprivation.  It is about keeping some people deprived.  Keeping them poorly.  There never will be enough to go around.  Comprehend - aye?  Now we understand.  Things must be kept competitive.  Competition!  It has to be sooooo competitive!  It just has to be artifically constructed to be a competition.  Why?  Because we want there to be losers.  We want there to be slaves. We want there to be people kept in deprivation.  People kept poorly.  Why?  So they will do anything anything anything anything that their superiors say.  It's sooooo competitive.  What did you want from your studnets Dr Leeks?  What did you require from the ones you were willing to sign off on as having completed their training in psychiatry?  Did you sign off on any of them?  What are they doing now? Distinguishing themselves Uffindell-like to be real leaders.  Willing to do what the teachers or guards or whatever say when it comes to picking out picking on and bullying this one or that one...  Why?  To keep them in line.  Bullying and abuse.  Deprivation.  Fear.  Loathing.  HOstility.  Maybe you can break them.  Do a needs assessment.  See if they need company (therefore seculusion for them only isoloation) or if they need solitude (thereore must be kept with at least one bunk mate at all times).  For the purposes of bullying and abuse and...  Torture.  We will have things no other way.  It's quite motivating and inspiring -- isn't it?  Doesn't it make you want to join them for all the right reasons?  The right reasons being not being kept in those appalling conditions of torture yourself.  What better reason could there possibly be?  Motivating and inspiring.  That's apparently what they take themselves to be.</p>

                            <p>So the government is trying to blame the people for not being financially literate that the government doesn't pay the workers.  That the government records false levels of debt against people's names.  Keeping false enrolment records and false records about programmes of study etc etc.  The government is trying to teach the people to hand all the money over to the government.  Put money into long term savings plans with the governmnt (we all know the money won't be there when you retire -- the government will have spent it all on themselves well before then)...  Purchase insurance?  But the insurance companies won't pay out.  Only reason to purchase insurance is when it is a condition of your mortgage so you don't have any other options.  That's what NZ is -- right?  How low can we go?  For people with no other options.  People who were born here (through no fault of their own) or people (often criminals) who flee here from overseas.  Let kim.com market NZ to the world.  If you come here from the USA you will not be extradited to stand trial for your crimes.  No extradition to the USA to stand trial.  Well, then, let anybody fearing prosectution from the USA government come to NZL.  Where they can continue on their criminal activity without fear of prosecution since the 'universities' can't even won't even process applications to enrol, completions of training.  But even if they did they would never register lawyers.  Even if they did they would never pay them.  Not if they were actually capable of filing before a filing deadline etc etc.  Lowest rate of successful prosecution of corruption related offences in the world, wasn't it?  It's like they've had their eyes poked out.</p>

                            <p>Why doesn't NZ have radiology?  Radiology has a centralised IT thing.  All the images.  DEXA or similar.  There is a centralised platform.  Unlike pathology.  There is not a centralised platform for pathology.  Not sure how much pathology work involves electronic (software driven) microscopy / photography / video vs how much of pathology is kept offline.  I mean to say that are we really supposed to believe that international community is shutting radiologists out of access to the scanned images?  Not likely.  What is more likely is that we simply don't have any radiologists.  Radiologists are the ones who write the radiology reports.  How many scans are given to radiologists (in NZ) to be made available to patients, surgeons, GPS etc WITH RADIOLOGY REPORTS?  Do we have any radiologists?  Writing radiology reports?  Doing radiology...  Whether something appears as a tumor or normal variation.  What the density is consistent with?  Or do the surgeons just color the bits they want to chop out red and show the patient the red bits and say 'see!  I fix it!'  Who signs informed consent for things like x-rays, anyway.  Isn't the idea to x-ray people soooo many times that they develop cancer?  I thought the idea was to murder death kill.  Murder death kill.  I mean, they aren't processing applications to enrol or progressions through training...  Blackbirding for criminals from the USA to come here...  Maybe play Orthopedics for 10 days and dump your wife at Hillmorton?  Only cost you..  HOwever much visa processing fee.  Then places in quarantine (while NZ citizens were kept out so that 5 SOuth Africans could be expedited through for the princely sum of??  How much??)  What health system?</p>

                            <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/132778326/labour-promises-compulsory-financial-literacy-lessons-for-school-children-national-backs-the-idea  And when the Inland Revenue Department records students as having student loans -- for courses or programmes of study they never even applied to be enrolled in...  That's okay -- according to judges re-appointed from retirement for the occasion.  Is that what you are going to teach them in the schools?   </p>

                            <p>Who was the champion for the Waikato supposed to be?  Henry Bennett?  Where are the students that he trained and signed off on?  Nobody?  Nobody was good enough for him?  Payroll for him (into retirement) until the day that he died?  Where are all his former studnets?  Shane Reti?  He was Waikato?  Now he explains to his constituency (what ties does he have to or for them) why the Whangarei hospital has..  Nobody.  He's registered to pratice.  Right?  For 1 or was that 3 weeks per year (only when government is on holiday) what a f*cking farce of a f*cking joke.  What idiot population need me to point out state the f*cking obvious.  Come on.  Retard land indeed.  Nobody home land.  What democracy?/p>

                            <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/300951508/it-was-a-clusterf-1080-blackmailer-jeremy-kerr-speaks-about-infamous-baby-formula-hoax-for-first-time  Was this before, during, or after Melamine was being put in the Infant Formula?  NZ decided to spend hundreds of thousands (if not millions) on advertising the milk powder as being free of round-up (but not melamine) -- is that the basic idea?  There is no alternative to round-up.  Never was.  Never will be.  NZ is the control group on the 'round up maybe doesn't cause issues or problems' leg of the experiment.  Right?  Of course nobody would have got ethics approval to run that overseas. Ethics approval?  What is that?  Is that where you find some criminal to pay hundreds of thousand if not millions to to assert that it's like he's had his eyes poked out and he simply cannot see anything wrong? </p>

                            <p>Let's talk about Maaori and science.  Let's talk about how they aren't getting nuclear submarines for the next...  100?  500?  Years (at least).  They aren't getting satellites...  Let's talk about Maaori science.  About the state of Maaori science.  About what technologies Maaori are and are not allowed.  I mean to say, if the elite white Australians aren't allowed nuclear submarines for the next 15 years (at least) then how much slower are Maaori expected to be following...  However many years behind...</p>

                            <p>Oh me oh my it's sooooooooo competitive.  It's sooooooo competitive.  Better ship people from South Africa and England and so on to 'look after' all the Maaori babies etc.  It's sooooo competitive.  Oh me, oh my.  And look at the state of Maaori science.  Let the tribal leaders tell the world which of the kids they are required to train (in the name of equity) because no other kids from their tribe are to be given those opportunities.  The leaders have all been picked out.  To go awwwwwww there.  Feel  better.  There's nothing we can do.  Awwwwww.  Look at the state of Maaori science.  Best get Dawkins to come to NZ and tell everyone about how f*cking selfish he is.  Selfish, selfish, selfish.  Him and his selfish f*cking genes.  It's sooooooo competitive.  Selfish selfish selfish.</p>

                            <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/496132/otago-graduates-make-history-by-defending-at-home </p>

                            <p>They made history becuase they were the only University of Otago students to be acnowledged as having completed their PhD within 3 years?  I bet they weren't acknowledged as having completed within 3 years.  I bet Otago got at least 4 years of government funding to have them enrolled and reenrolled and re re re enrolled.  </p>

                            <p>You aren't supposed to defend your thesis to people who are supposed to be supporting you to complete it.  People who are supposed to be helping you and wanting you to succeed.  You don't defend your thesis against your biggest supporters...  What sense is there in that?</p>

                            <p>Is international community supposed to be hostile, then?  Um..  Well...  I remember reading a book or two... From people in Ausssie and so on.  People writing about how they approach externally examining PhD's.  I remember them saying that they really wanted to pass the thesis.  That the students had obviously and clearly worked hard at it.  Put in a lot of work.  That they felt their job was to suggest bits to make it a bit better and be there to watch the students succeed.  Witness.  Publicity.  Two people from overseas examined the thesis.  That means to say they were paid to read it and think about it and comment on it.  Publicity.  Acknowledgement.  Not only by local community but by international.</p>

                            <p>These Maaori students didn't get to present their research to Indigenous or non-indegenous communities overseas.  Nobody from overseas came to NZ for their thesis defence.  The thesis defence is the showcase.  The students get to say what they did..  Answer questions that they know the answer to.  Demonstrate their expertise.  Be seen to be experts.</p>

                            <p>The people employed out at Tamaki to do public health used to say that the tribal leaders send their kids to Tamaki so they can be picked to do Medical School so they can be sent back to the local communities as Doctor.  They aren't supposed to be going overseas.  They are the property of their local community.  But they didn't see why they would send them to University if they had already picked them to be leaders of their local tribe.  Just keep them in the local tribe, then.  WHy send them to University at all?</p>

                            <p>I don't think NZ students (or Australian students) have oral defences of their PhD's.  I never saw any studnets defend their thesis to external examiners my whole time I was at the ANU.  And the supervisors would choose to support some of their studnets and choose to destroy others.  Like how Kim Sterelny interrupted other staffs questioning of Brett and Ben for their 6 monthly review.  And then he wouldn't even come to fellows for a drink after my mid-term (as was customary) after being most hostile questioner for my mid-term.  Nobody seemed to have a problem with my mid-term.  Except for him.  It's soooooo hostile.  Except that Ben and Brett and Rachel and so on didn't ever actually defend their thesis against external examination -- did they?  I don't remember externals questioning them...  Did they actually get reports from international examiners?  Suggesting changes to their theses to make their theses better?  Or did the University just decide to hand them their qualificatios for unknown reasons, really, while refusing to acknowledge any of my work.  How many years did Carl slave before his work was acknowledged?  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                            <p>__</p>

                            <p>I just love this idea that Professor Glue (for example) is going to try and recruit psychiatrists and mental health nurses etc from overseas by telling them all about his work at conferences.  People are going to roll up to listen to him talk about how he gives ketamine to particularly young female clients or patients who have been deemed non-responsive to any other form of treatment.  Last resort for them, at such a young age.  Horse tranquiliser.  Then we can see how many people who didn't think that NZ was a place where they wanted to go to practice psychiatry or mental health nursing..  We can see how many of them are going to, after hearing his presentation at conference, pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for visa processing.  For airfares.  Pay and pay and pay and pay and pay because they want to continue on the good works of Professor Glue with his Glue Factory that he's got going on there.  It's a wonderful solution to how NZ is going to train the next generation of psychiatrists and mental health nurses.  See how many people from overseas will pay and pay and pay and pay and pay to get in on the action.</p>

                            <p>Our reputation will likely help us on the world stage, as well.  The ideal of being made  bachelor again.  Your wife being imprisoned in a literal prison or maybe a psychiatric institution like Hillmorton.  Look into that maybe, see if that is a place where you might like to work.  Get in there and do a little anything anything anything with immunity to any kinds of consequences.  Read up on the crimes committted by various people on payroll (supposedly or apparently) as 'doctor'.  The drink driving offences.  The involuntary organ harvest (wrong leg, sorry).  The cervical examinations performed on non-consenting patients.  Take all of this to international conferences and see how many foreigners are willing to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay to move to NZ on the promise of them getting to call themselves 'doctor' and do anything anything anything.</p>

                            <p>At least they don't have to worry about local 'competition' since the only local 'Universities' (Auckland and Otago) are unwilling and unable to process applications to enrol in Medicine.  But even if they manage to process an application to enrol they won't process a graduation.  But even if they did do that the registration people would never register the graduates.  But even if the registration people did register the graduates they would never actually be employed to do clinical work.  They would rather pay them to go overseas and blackbird for foreign criminals to come to NZ and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay in return for getting to do anything anything anything.  So long as it is continuing on the good works of Professor Green and Leeks and Glue..  They will not have things any other way.  Quite by design.</p>

                            <p>The Waikato Times has reported several occasions of the Waikato District Health Board having people on payroll for Psychiatry who never went to Medical School.  They were frauds.  Hoaxes.  It is disingenuous to suppose that they did not know this when they chose to employ them.  When they chose to throw everybody else's application away.  When they chose to allow the frauds to pay and pay and pay for visa etc.  Why?  I think because the DHB didn't pay them very much.  So they were relatively cheap workers.  One of the frauds they hired said he never wrote any prescriptions.  He would always get a second opinion or something and he just never signed his name on any prescription sripts for medication.  So I don't know, then, who was responsible for drugging those patients.  If they were given ketamine or LSD or horse tranquiliser.  If they were given clozapine or chlorpromazine.  If they were given ECT.  If they had their nasal polyps removed..  A swizzle stick to the frontal lobes..  On the instructions of..  Of, um.  Uh.  Er...  I don't know if the DHB simply paid a foreigner not very much to get in there and have a go... Or if maybe the DHB didn't pay the foreigner anything at all.  If it was simply a way of management or administration taking the money out by passing various people off as clinical workers when the people passing themselves off as clinical workers paid and paid and paid and paid and paid the 'University' of Auckland and the royal australasian college of psychiatrists..  Paid and paid and paid and paid and paid...  What health system?  There really doesn't seem to be anything there, at all.  Can't even wont' even process applications to enrol in Medical Training.  Refusing to graduate people who have met requirements for the degree.  Will not pay people to work clinical jobs.  What health system?  F*cking scummy hoax of a f*cking scummy scam. There isn't anything there.  Won't do it.  Going to send Professor f*cking glue to go blackbirding for slaves...</p>

                            <p>____________</p>

                            <p>Amnesty International seems to have vanished from it's office on Karangahape Road / Queen Street.  I went in to speak to them about NZ Universities keeping slaves - refusing to get graduate studnets work out for external examination so as to extort more and more and more and more fees from them.  More and more and more money for visa processing etc etc.  They videoed me complaining.  Pretty sure.  Took me into a room and video recorded my complaint.  I suppose, then, that the recordings will also show what response I received, when I complained.  Silly silly silly girl.  Amnesty International doesn't have a presence in Auckland to hear complaints about how people are treated in NZ.  Amnesty International had a presence in Auckland only to hear complaints about how NZers are being treated *overseas*.  We don't know how lucky we are!  To have migrant workers here, working in Amnesty International Offices!  Videoing people who complain about NZ keeping slaves.  Refusing to pay workers.  Holding hostages.  Refusing to acknowledge work that people have done.  It doesn't cost them anything to print a meaningless piece of paper acknowledging that one applied to be enrolled in a 1 year research project -- and here, then, is the research that was produced within 1 year.  That's what it is or means to do a 1 year research project.  To do the f*cking project.  While they pretend to be too f*cking stupid to acknowledge the work that's been done.  So that all these people over 65 can take and take and take and take and take all this money to keep whole harems of dependents.  Doing all of the work for no pay.  Going away camping and housesitting for their supervisors.  Buying their supervisors birthday presents.  Throwing them parties.  Drinking with them etc etc...  What University?  Not even pretending to be a developed nation, hey.  There's nothing there ffs.  </p>

                            <p> https://www.nzherald.co.nz/travel/go-back-to-australia-expat-told-after-offensive-us-flag-tiktok-post/NXOWDA4MLJCPNOYQ2O64HXLFUY/  You need to get out a bit more away from the typical tourist routes to see the conferacy flags being flown.  That's why you see so many US flags.  Becuase of the number of confederacy flags that are still being flown.  The United States is not very united.  It's a propaganda campaign.  Nationalism.  Trying to present a United front.  Having things like sport and so on.  It's supposed to bring together people within the US and have them feel like they are on the same team rather than them feeling like they are part of a nation that is divided.  It is supposed to remind them that if they pull together then the United States would be the greatest country in the world.  It's the propaganda aspirational ideology campaign.  But it doesn't really catch on when people see how their applications aren't being processed and the corruption and so on.  They see the thin facade for what it is...  Not even trying to be fair, at all...  </p>
                           
                            <p>There is an age of retirement for civil servants / government employees.  Many of them were expedited into their payrolled positions on the basis of who their parents were, more than anything else, and they've had 45+ years of government payroll so they could keep entire harems of dependents.  And now it's time for them to retire.  Only, they won't get out.  How old is Justice Toogood?  Since when did reappointing a Judge who was past the age of retirement constitute a Judge having been appointment by proper process?  We are really expected to believe that abosolutely nobody else could have worked that job.  We'll need to blackbird for some foreigner to work it.  Lure them here under false pretences.  Get them to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for visa processing and moving expenses.  Then simply not pay them and awwwww.  What are they going to do about it?  Them and whose army?  How many 'medical doctors' are over the age of 65.  Still on government payroll.  They won't train anybody else, they won't register anybody else.  Mostly they don't actually know anything.  They were hurried into postition when they were 17 or 18.  Quickly quickly quickly before the people realise they don't know anything and they simply aren't that bright.  Get in there!  Have a go!  Abortions.  Euthanasia.  Arficial insemination.  Knock-out babies.  Gene studies.  Fixing up the nasal polyps (labotomies).  Electric stimulation to the genitals.  The babies in the incubators.  Experiments on oxygen deprivation and setting them up for a lifetime of 'I'm soooo lucky I'm a gamma baby I don't have to work half as hard as Ashley Bloomfield'...  The only game in town.  Can't even / won't even process applications for enrolment.  Won't acknowledge progression through training.  Can't even / won't even get work to external examiners.  What University?  What Health System?  What Judiciary?  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  There's really nothing there, hey.  All these people over 65 years on payroll and however many of the next generation expected to just f*ck off and die, then, so that the likes of Justice Toogood can have yet another day in court.  He can't even / won't even see anything wrong...  Poor Dr Leeks.  Poor Dr Green.  What they were doing wasn't any different or any worse than anything that everybody else on payroll was or is doing.  Right?  Poor poor them.  Best give them more and more government handouts to enable them to move someplace new and continue on with their crimes.  </p>

                            <p>The NZ government cries and cries and cries about how it doesn't have enough money.  But it refuses to collect taxes that every other nation collects.  Will not do it.  Insists on being a tax haven for all the criminals of the world.  That is the function of NZ.  Right?  To be a prison camp detention facility.  That always was the function of Australasia.  To be a destination location that was attractive to all the criminals of the northern hemisphere.  Try and lure them here all voluntary-like.  All the criminals of the northern hemisphere.  NZ and Australia doesn't need to train doctors or lawyers or engineers.  We can take the incompetent ones struck off for malpractice from the Northern Hemisphere.  America and England can threaten their students with being shipped to the colonies having to mind the gamma babies arranging for their overexposure to lead and so on so that Des can't see anything wrong you simply can't prooove that there is an association between exposure to lead and brain damage.  It isn't brain damage, anyway, Williams Syndrome is endemic and it's culturally normal for no attachment to a paraticular or specific individual to form and...  The dumb and dumber show.  The problem of evil.  Indeed.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  More than 45 years of government payroll.  Get the f*ck out.  Payroll stops.  Why is that so f*cking hard to understand?  Nobody home.  Nothing there, hey.</p>

                            <p>See the people they choose to fund..  What it is that they value.</p>
