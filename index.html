                                   <p>What is that Sterelny?  You pay only peanuts so you expect for people to behave indistinguishably from monkeys only.  That way you can feel all smug and superior for being behaviourally modern.  It's soooo behaviourally modern to go on and on about how hostile and competitive everything is.  What education and training system?  There isn't anything there.  They won't get the studnets work out for external examination.  Not because they think the externals will fail the students but because they think they will pass them.  They are abusive  bullies.  That is what they are.  Not even trying to be fair at all.</p>

                                   <p>They cry cry cry about how they don't have any money to pay their workers.  But various people are over the age of 65 and they won't get out.  Sterelny isn't supposed to be payrolled anymore he's over the age of 65.  Various judges of the courts of NZ are not supposed to be having more and more and more days in court.  They have had more than 45 years of government payroll for themselves and it's time for them to retire.  The fact that they refused to educate and train the next generation is no excuse for them not to get out.  Get out.  If they won't stand down voluntarily...  They declared war on the younger generation who they will not pay.  They won't do it.  It's time for them to go.  Only over their dead bodies.  They would have things no other way.  They expect the likes of me to curl up and die now that it's time for them to pay me.  F*cking psychopaths.  There's nothing there.  Nobody home.  It got taken over by psychopaths.  That's what Sterelny would say.  It's soooo hostile and it's soooo competitive and everybody is bullied away.  Sterelny is the only game in town.  Who wants to go away camping with Sterelny?  It's soooo important for your career.  It's soooo important for your career to hand over your work to various people already on payroll so they can pass it off as their own.  F*cking psychopaths.  There's nothing there. </p>
