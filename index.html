                                <p>
                                The work that I had done in the Philosophy of Psychopathology was all  based on the assumption that we were trying to help people in ways they wanted to be helped rather than engaging in a process of harming people.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                So, for example, I was trying to extend work that had been done on delusions so as to help people with delusions not be delusional anymore.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                But if the aim or the point or the purpose is to unlawfully detain (in conditions of torture, even) as many people as you can...  Well, then, you can see a different function, entirely, for the diagnosing and 'treating' of delusions.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                New Zealand has been exposed to Psychiatry.  Dr Melphi (Sopranos).  Dr Katz.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                But New Zealand does not appear to have Psychiatry.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I presented to the ED of the Auckland City Hospital.  I had been walking extensively during lock-down and with previous disfiguration to my toes (clawing and hammering with some numbness) they ended up mechanically injured and I was concerned about hookworm from walking barefooted in the Domain.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I don't know if it was on the basis of my filenotes or on the basis of my being known from the University of Auckland having decided that I was not going to do Medicine (even if it meant they were not going to enter my GPA corrrectly and they were not going to accept my thesis submission of 2018).  But I do know that they accused me of being 'delusional' and held me in a room for 12 hours that could reasonably be expected to induce symptoms of sensory deprivation in most people.  They seemed to be doing everything they could to make me delusional, in other words.  So they could then record that they were justified in detaining me under the Mental Health Act.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                They would rather treat me like that than train me to do Medicine.  They would be correct that I'm not exactly Dr Leeks 2.0 material.  I never did find Dr Leeks motivating or inspiring.  I never wanted to be like that or be like him.  I never wanted to train under people like that or like him.  That is not Psychiatry.  This is not a Health System.  They don't see the people presenting as people.  Cattle or lambs to the slaughter.  They survive in spite of.  Not because of.
                                </p>
