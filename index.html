 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                            <p>
                            I was born in NZ.  I studied Philosophy and Psychology at the University of Waikato.  My first year of study I did 9 courses (4x4 and summer school) so more than 120 points.  I then had a rocky time for a couple years with family stuff.  My brother died <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/canyon-tragedy-trial-waste-of-time-says-victims-father/YVO43OPH7Z4G4KKHBCICRHALJU/">canyoning in switzerland.</a>  While I was on track for passing my courses I had a couple of rounds of compassionate withdrawals.  

                            <p>I then completed a part time year (2x2 and summer school).  I then completed another full time year with 4x4 and summer school.  I then completed an Honors Year, again with 4x4 and summer school.  So I completed a BA(hons), a 4 year Degree Programme in 3 full time and 1 part time year because of how I distributed my workload.  I was also tutoring and grading from my Honors Year.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I obtained a Summer Research Scholarsip to the Australian National University at the end of my Honors Year.  I worked with Professor Martin Davies on an Australian Research Council Funded Project that had been funded on delusions.  
                            </p>

                            <p>I asked Professor Davies to write me a reference for applications to the USA to study for my PhD.  I wanted to study a 5 year programme comprised of 2 years course-work (with breadth requirement) before writing a 3 year thesis.  It seemed to me that Philsophy was a very broad subject and there were still major areas of Philsosophy that I hadn't studied.  I believed it was important, also to go to graduate school someplace different from where you went to undergraduate school so as to have exposure to different topics and different people and different ideas.  Professor Davies told me that he would not write me a reference for USA PhD's 'ask the people back home, who will rave about you'.  He said he would put in a good word for me at the ANU if I applied to there, however.
                            </p>

                            <p>He said someting about 'oooh, you want to talk to me about fame and glory.'  I didn't really know what to say about that, so I didn't say anything.  I suppose I realise, now, he thought that I thought I was too good for the ANU.  That wasn't why I wanted to go to the USA, however.  If the ANU had have offered a 5 year PhD programme with 2 years of course-work and a selection of courses in the first two years then ANU would have been my first choice.  It wasn't about fame or glory.  It was about going someplace with a developed curriculum where I would be formally taught and I would learn and I would come out of that kind of a programme able to competently teach a greater breadth and depth of classes.  I applied to MIT and Cornell because I hadn't done enough Math for the GRE and they were the only 2 programmes in the top 100 (with developed PhD curriculums) who did not require the GRE.  It wasn't that I thought I was too good for Australasia.  It was that I genuinely wanted to help Australasia.  I don't see how everybody racing their way to the money is helping Australasia develop.  Well, then, I must be forced to live on disability for less tham minimum wage.  If I'm too stupid to understand about the money.
                            </p>

                            <p>Professor Davies told me not to apply to the USA and Australasia during the same year.  He said that due to the way funding rounds worked I would need to confirm or reject an offer from Australasia before I heard back from the USA.  If I accepted a funded offer from Australasia and then accepted a funded offer from the USA and informed Australasia I was declining the place after all, then the Australasian University would irrrevokably miss out on a student place and the funding associated with a student place for that funding year.  
                            </p>

            
                            <p>I therefore acted in good faith by holding off applying for PhD in Australasia for another year so as to apply to the USA.  Nobody helped me with applications to that.  I suppose, retrospecitively, that is strange, since my supervisor at Waikato was a former Princeton Graduate.  He didn't help me with applying, at all.  I guess he wanted to keep me at Waikato, really.  My applications to MIT and Cornell were unsuccessful.  The University of Waikato informed me that there was no problem, for them, if I were to take another year with them to write my Masters and I keep working with them, part time, tutoring and grading.  I therefore extended my MA enrolment so the 120 points were stretched over 2 academic years and 1 summer school period.  The MA was a 120 point research only MA that was completed after I had done an Honors Year in the very same subject.  120 points over 2 academic years and 1 summer school period = part time enrolment. 
                            </p>

                            <p>My MA does not contribute towards my full-time GPA.  It would not be fair to expect students to write something of that quality over only 1 year.  For the record, I was given (by Professor Gillett of the University of Otago) an A for the thesis.  He said that he could not give it an A+ because of typographical errors and misuse of the apostrophe rule.  I accept responsibility for the quality of my thesis but do think it is sad that my supervisor couldn't / wouldn't so much as help me with basic editing services.  I mean, what do they pay him for?
                            </p>

                             <p>I did not know that some people have (are encouraged to have) an attitude whereby the main aim or goal or purpose or point is to race your way to PhD or 'doctor' status before you turn 25.  I did not know that students would be more interested in, for example, enrolling in a 3 year PhD programme immediately after their honors year (if they had the gradest to do that -- which I certainly did).  I wanted to learn more.  I suppose I thought that I was investing in my future.  Not chasing the money.  Trying to learn more.  Longer term.  I do not know at what point people were just taking me for a fool.  Probably at the point when I applied to do a MA with the University of Waikato when I would have received funding to do a PhD had I applied to that programme.  They thought I was stupid for not realising I had the grades sufficient to do that and they thought I was stupid for not trying to race my way to PhD completion ASAP.  I think that's about when they thought I belonged on the rubbish heap. 
                            </p>

                            <p>I was offered Australian Post-Graduate Award funding to do a PhD at The Australian National University.  So I suppose that Professor Martin Davies supported my application, to there.  They were happy enough with the quality of the work that I had produced over the Summer Research Scholarship and with several writing samples I had extracted from my MA (typographical errors and all) for me to be funded to do my PhD with them.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Professor Martin Davies had left the ANU for Oxford before I started my PhD with the ANU in 2006. I have asked the ANU for my student records.  So I can see what they have recorded about my 6 monthly progress and my mid-term review.  I have posted my work I was doing over that time on the seminars and writing page of this site.  I was granted a VC travel scholarship so as to put my PhD enrolment on hold for 1 academic year.  I was able to use the funding to travel to the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill for 1 academic year as a visiting scholar.  In exhange for tutoring and grading 1 course per semester (what their graduate students are expected to do) they put me on the equivalent of a graduate student stipend.  That meant I could audit (attend for non-credit) PhD level courses at the UNC, Chapel Hill and neighbouring Duke University. I was very pleased to have the opportunity to take courses in areas of Philosophy I didn't really have the opportunity to study in Australasia and also to study Cognitive Neuroscience at PhD level at Duke with the people who wrote the text-book for that.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            On my return to ANU something happened around my mid-term review.  I wasn't allowed to give it before I left...  Anyway...  I ended up leaving the University without having submited a thesis for examination.  I left the University not wanting to do any more work in Philosophy.  I wasn't entirely sure what I was going to do.  I guess I thought I would go to Wellington and try and get an entry level Government Job as a Policy Advisor or Analyst, or something, on the back of my MA.  I tried to do that for around a year and nothing was coming through for me.  No work.  So I inquired into returning to University study.  Then I started looking into Medicine, particularly, and whether I could pursue entering into that programme.  Work and Income (Ministry of Social Development) seemed supportive about my doing that.  Student Loans were approved.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I then found myself being failed for First Year courses.  For example, being repeatedly failed for first year population health essays (so I was informed I was 'ineligible to even apply' to Medicine).  I asked about whether completing a 120 point MPhil from Waikato would be enough for me to be eligible to apply (my GPA would come from my  undergrad and honors full time years) and they agreed to that.  But then Waikato refused to enrol me in the course I applied to by the application deadline.  They enrolled me in courses I never applied to.  They informed me I could not complete the qualification in the normal time for a 120 point qualification.  They refused to get my work to external examiners.  They sent the under 50,000 word Masters thesis out to be examined for PhD (so it could only be found by externals to come up short).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I don't know how much it is a personal thing against me.  They knew I wanted to complete it in order to do Medicine.  I don't know how much they refused to allow me to complete it because they had something personal against me.  I think New Zealand Universities, generally, are not allowing students to complete graduate research qualifications, particularly, in the time they are supposed to be completed.  They are big about allowing people to have extensions and so on,  but the reality seems to be that they believe they are entitled to force people to take out extensions.  I think something dodgey in going on with them double-billing for students.  I think there is something like that going on. I also think there is something going on when they think the aim or the goal or the purpose or the point is to race to doctor status by the time you are 25.  Then you get a Government job (once you are on pay-roll they can't get rid of you unless you are really really gregariously terrible after many many warnings first -- and your payroll only goes up from there!  So then you get...  25 years of pay until you are 50.  35 years of pay until you are 60.  45 years of pay until you are 70.  Hell, work some desk-job and get yourself in to position where you collect up the money and don't so much as read anything for typography!  Living the dream!  If you don't play this game you must be stupid -- right?  No money for you, then.  You lose.  You lose the great game of life.  Let's pull Judges out of retirement to deal to your filings.  All of the money for them.  None of the money for you.  Just keep working Ms Roe, for no pay, just never stop paying the University, Ms Roe.  Just keep paying them while they don't progress your work.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I exhausted internal complaints resolution process and it seemed to me that the Universities were only obstructive.  They thought the purpose or point of the internal complaints resolution process was to bully the studnet into shutting up.  The VC of Waikato advised me to take them to court via judicial review of administrative action if I didn't think that how they treated my enrolment in 2018 and 2019 was lawful.  So I did that.  The Judges seem to think that the piont of legal process is to bully the applicant into shutting up, again.  I have posted some of my filings here because it seems to me that justice has not been done by the courts.  It is now 2022.  They say 'justice delayed is justice denied'.  The courts are denyign me justice.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I have recently asked the ANU for my student records so I can see what went wrong with my PhD and see if it is possible for them to get my work to externals (bundle it up, or something) and see if I've done enough for a PhD yet.  They should have records of my progress at the 6 monthly mark, the mid-term mark.  They should have records of my progress when they chose to give me a travel scholarship and support me in going to the USA.  Presumably they wouldn't have given me the award if they felt I was floundering or a weak studnet.  I want to see evidence of my supervision and I want to see what was said about my submission date.  I was granted 1 extra year of funding (for a total of 4 years living stipend).  So there was enough progress for them at the 3 year marks to approve another year of funding.  So, then, what happened?  I have uploaded a more than 100,000 word document that I supplied to Kim Sterelny before I left Australia.  I don't know why that wasn't given to externals.
                            </p>

                            <p>I thought...  My understanding was that it was reasonable to believe that a PhD from the ANU would make it likely that I would end up with post-docs and / or a tenured position as a philosophy acadaemic.  That seems to be what happens to most of their graduates.  Maybe not so much their New Zealand Graduates.  They used to be able to get Australian Government jobs, but then Australia stopped that.  Because NZ was complaining about the brain drain.  Australia taking all the grads.  So Australia stopped taking the grads into government.  So that NZ could hire them, then.  Only NZ won't hire them.  So...  So I guess there isn't any point Australia giving NZ students PhD's even.  Because NZ will never hire them.  But will complain about them having taken the student.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            When you have a job with a University usually you can take courses with the University without paying.  So, on the back of a job in a University I could have taken courses while earning a paycheck.  I thought...  I thought I was making an investment or sacrifice.  Instead of an employed position (with study as a hobby that I didn't have to pay for and with a paycheck as well) I was choosing to be a fairly poor studnet living fairly minimally for a few more years yet, in the hope that I would get to study Medicine.  I was working towards that.  Following their advice on how you earn entry to Medicine in NZ.  They wanted me to do a 120 point research project in Philosophy.  That should have been easy.  I had a reason to get the work in by the deadline.  I knew that supervisors in Australasia are not forthcoming about your deadline.  I mean, as an undergrad I was given deadlines on when my work was due.  And I submitted it on time and there never was any problem.  Then you get to graduate school and even if (as in this last time) you are upfront about asking when you need to get the thesis in by they just won't agree to anything.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            They say that the programme is 1 year.  So they say you need to labor for 12 months before submitting your work for a 3 month external examination.  They also say that in the case of MPhil or PhD examination the outcome of what they will call 'first examination' is that you have to re-enrol and keep working for another 6 months before submitting your thesis again.  Then there is another 3 months of external examination.  And now the most likely outcome depends a bit on the NZ University.  Waikato has up to 10 weeks for changes to the substance to be made.  So that's 1 year plus 6 months extra work plus 3x2=6 months external exam and another 2 1/2 months.  So that's more than 24 months of work for a 120 point qualification.  So that's forcing students (as a matter of course) to part-time status.  My evidence for this is here:
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications.  They define a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a> 
                            </p>

                        <p>It has  been since my legal proceedings that the law has  been changed to explicitly mention 2 things.  Firstly, that the University has fiduciary duty to students.  That is to say, the point of the University supervisor etc is not to fail the student.  It is not to stabotage or undermine or obstruct or prevent or prohibit.  It is to help the student complete the work.  The second is that the University does not get to force students to labor with only part time credit.  There are discrepancies in their billing and invoicing practices.  Around the fees that they are obtaining in forcing re-enrolments.  It seems to me that they are double-invoicing the government for having students.  It seems to me that the law change (particularly around not forcing students to work for part-time credit) has been a response to what happened with me.  But there has not been any justice for me.
                        </p>

                        <p>I completed a 120 point MPhil for Waikato in 2018.  I understand that various people do not like things that I said in my thesis.  They don't need to like it, however.  They needed to get the thesis and the sign off forms to the externals and ALLOW the externals to sign off on it being enough for 120 points credit.  And they just refused to do that.  Apparently all Degrees are Honorary Degrees.  To be given or withheld for reasons that New Zealand Universities are not accountable for.  Add to that fact the 'tall poppy syndrome' that NZ is notorious for.  The aim is to keep your head down and race to PhD as quick as you can.  The easiest way to do that is to get as close to your supervisor as you can and extract a thesis out of your supervisor as quickly as possible.  They will accept themselves, you see.  And people accepted them enough to put them on payroll.  So you can just be little them with plagarised stuff from them that they gave you.  Then you just need to find a supervisor who isn't suicidal about their own creations.  Someone who is visibly seen as being personally productive.  So they won't try and destroy your creations as they destroy their own (the problem I had with Justine). 
                        </p>


                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  You can judge for yourself whether I am bringing a case of public interest before the courts, and whether Otago should be held accountable for refusing to supply applications, refusing to process applications, and for removing applications from the applicant pool prior to merit-based selection.  They collect up information about disability prior to selection for the explicit purpose of excluding otherwise qualified candidates.  The courts refuse to rule that discrimination against people on the basis of disability is unlawful.

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings on grounds that it had already passed judgment on the filings and would not revisit the issue.  They did not think my filings sufficient to show there had been a grotesque injustice in how they handled my filings.  I post them here so that you can judge for yourself.

                            It seems to me that the Australian Constition explicitly mentions New Zealand as a State of the Federation of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  
                            It is interpreted by most people to be an invitation for NZ to join at some future point rather than a declaration that it is part of the Federation (even though it has not consented to be part of the Federation).
