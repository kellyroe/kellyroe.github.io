                            <article>

                                <p>New Zealand and Australia undermine themselves.  They won't get studnets work to external examiners so that it can be externally examined on it's academic merits.  They aren't processing applications to enrol, progressions through training, qualification completions properly.  THey aren't advertising jobs, selecting from applicants on the basis of skills and experience, paying them properly.  THey aren't doing anything properly.  They just redeploy people into position so they can ensure that the job for which they are paid is not actually performed by anybody at all.  There is nothing here.  </p>

                                <p>The leaders apparently choose (exerting their own soverignty) to run Australasia like a slave, prison, or detention camp.  THey aren't at all even trying to be fair.  No conception of fairness, even.  Lacking the cognitive capacity.  It's all sooooooo competitive.</p>

                                <p>Head of MFAT is now saying they aren't even trying to be rule  by law.  I think that's why they aren't allowed to make milk powder unsupervised.  After poisoning the 'one child' with melamine, not allowed to make milk powder unsupervised.  Can't fly planes into NZ, even, because they won't follow international laws on flight path approaches etc.  Can't do business with NZ, the courts don't function.  They won't schedule a hearing, but if they do they won't hear the case that was actually brought before the courts, but if they do they won't find in the interests of justice.    Nobody there.  Nothing home.  </p>

                                <p>Una Jagose asserts that her job, as head of Crown Law is to serve the interests of Crown Law.  Yes.  That's what Justice means, Una.  I see why you were specially chosen for that job.  Did you even supply them a CV or did they tell you that was simply a formality because they picked you out for that one because you exemplified all the qualities they value?  They wanted to do everything they could to completely and utterly undermine public confidence in law, in NZ.  No conception of justice, at all. </p>

                                <p>The leaders of NZ have never been known or regarded as intellectuals.  They have always been regarded as anti-intellectuals.  The least well educated civil service and government in the world.  They preferentially hired graduates after 3 or 4 years of university study (only) to the civil service.  Preferring them to be younger and less knowledgeable and less experienced.  The idea was that they needed the Ministers to be able to understnd the reports.  They couldn't rely on the reading age or comprehension of the ministers being much more than them being able to read the abstract or table of contents.  So the reports say the same thing over and over and over and over and over.  So the Ministers don't need to read the reports.  The reports can only say what the Ministers said already so that the Ministers can claim to understand the reports.   </p>

                                <p>This preference for the youngest and stupidist being the most desirable.  The most 'trainable'.  To make the senior people feel competent.  Great way to run a country..  Into the ground.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>People come back from overseas with knowledge and skills and the leaders from here refuse to acknowledge them or allow them to function or contribute.  Because the f*cking stupid is too f*cking stupid.  And they know it.  They never would have been appointed into position if they had have been anything else.  Intentionally deployed to ensure the prevention and prohibition of development in the slave colony prison camp detention facility lands.  Not even trying to develop.  Everything they can to prevent and prohibit it and follow as slowly behind dragging the heels every step of the way.  Retard-land.  People kept retarded.  There is nothing here.</p>

                                <p>There aren't any universities because they aren't processing the applications to enrol properly.  They aren't progressing people through their qualifications.  They aren't graduating all and only the people who did the work they were supposed to for the qualification.  They aren't paying the workers.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>What is a GP supposed to do, exactly?  Let's have a think about that, so we can understand why it is desirable to pick out teengers when they are 18 for that one.  Firstly, they say 'we will get an assistant to the nurses assistant to take a sample and send it to the labs' because you can't diagnose very many things without pathology reports.  Secondly, they say 'it is probably a virus therefore there is nothing we can do so no antibiotics for you go way' (that was a big one, prior to 2018).  Thirdly, they say 'hmm.  We better watch and wait and see what happens.  Come back to me again if things get worse'.  That way they get more money for repeat visits, at least.  Fourthly, they say 'go to the ED'.  Fifthly, they say 'that's outside my scope of practice so I'll put you on the waitlist to see a specialist'.  What else does a GP do, in NZ?  The assistant to the nurses assistant (likely the unpaid student doing their internship) does the blood pressure and so on.  So what are GPs for, exactly?  What is it that they do?  Aside from telling people that healthcare is not for them by delay delay delay delay until they die, of course.  Which is basically the same function as the judiciary.  And basically everything else in NZ.</p>

                                <p>Is someone really doing their PhD thesis on attachment and how people attach to cats, or similar?  Who is supervising that one?  I'm curious because I was interested in psychoanalytic / dynamic / attachment stuff for a while there and I didn't see any university academics in NZ doing any research along the lines of any of that.  It surprises me that there would be.  We are basically doing 'Brave New World' types of interventions trying to breed or raise a slave class of Gamma babies by design.  Raising them in Fisher and Paykal incubators.  After having induced premature delivery in the name of 'for their own good' so as to interrupt attachment.  Sort of raise them as Harry Harlow primate research laboratory babies.  Run this social engineering experiment out of New Zealand.  Of course.  So the graduates from Harvard can come visit and see how the Harry Harlow primates are doing and see Rheumatic Fever in the wild etc.  Are our leaders really too stupid to see any of this for what it is?  Too stupid by design?</p>
