                <p>The above was supplied to my supervisor and the table of contents (together with a chapter word count totaling more than 100,000 words) was supplied to the ANU administration at a point in time when they had me enrolled in the PhD programme.  </p>

                <p>University of Auckland employees who were payrolled to give studnets course advice advised me to complete a new qualification from a NZ University for purposes of `eligibility' for MBChB. To this end I applied to be enrolled in a 120 point 1 EFT MPhil with the Univesrity of Waikato starting 05 March 2018.  I supplied them with a under 50,000 words MPhil thesis document on 14 September, 2018.</p>

                <p>They never sent it out for external examination.  Never.  They say I voluntarily chose to withdraw my thesis submissions.  But they don't have any evidence that I asked them not to send it out.  They only have evidence tht I repeatedly asked them to send it out while they kept saying they did not have to because I posted it to them and I needed to give it to them in person or because I emailed and posted it to Professor Kay Weaver in her capacity as Dean of the Research School when I was supposed to have emailed or posted or handed it in in person to the Research School and not to Kay Weaver (whose office is in the Research School).  The calendar regulations say that her job (The Dean of the Research School) is to send it out to externals for external examination.  That was why I posted 3 spiral bound copies to her and emailed her.  So she couldn't claim that I didn't.  The courier says that the documents were signed as being received by the research school.  I had acknowledgement that they recieved my emailed documents.  The Dean did.  The Research School office.  No snipers from sniper towers required.  It was posted.  Physically.  And emailed.  They refused to send it out for external examination.  What University?  There isn't anything there. </p>

                <p>I supplied a thesis 05 October 2018 and they sent the under 50,00 word masters thesis out for external examination requesting external write `doctoral reports' of it.  They asked them to externally examine it for the wrong qualification.  Check their accounts whether they paid the externals to write doctoral reports or whether they paid them to examine a masters thesis.  The dollar amounts are different for those different activities.  My invoice says that the examination fee is `payable by doctoral examination fee waiver for domestic students'.  But I was not enrolled in the doctoral programme with Waikato so they had no right to claim doctoral examination fees when I never gave them a doctoral thesis to be examined.  They are refusing to examine people for qualifications they claim to have enrolled them in.  What education and training programme?  There doesn't seem to be anything there.  PRison.  Detention camp.  </p>

                <p>I supplied them a thesis 24 February 2019.  It had been substantively updated in response to the `doctoral reports' I received from examiners in December.  The Dean instructed me to write a commentary or something to accompany my changes.  So I'm supposed to write something about how I can't do all the changes the NZ examiner asks of me because I'm doing a masters thesis with a word length limit of under 50,000 words and I can't add another 50,000 words to the substance as they seem to be requiring of me in their recommendations of substantive changes (substance to be added) for it to be acceptable as a doctoral thesis.  
                    
                </p>

                <p>The `University' never sent the commentary and never sent the substantively updated thesis out to the externals so that they could sign off on the subtantive changes within 10 weeks.  The Uni calendar regulations say that when substantive changes are indicated to be required by the examiners then there are two different ways in which they are to be done.  Firstly, if the externals return the thesis to the candidate (which the externals did not) then the student is to be re-enrolled for 6 more months before another 3 month external exam.  So, repeat the year on a 120 point 1 EFT programme.  Do the whole thing over again.  Else, if they don't return the thesis to the canadidate (both of htem refused to return it to me even when the Uni asked them to do this) then the studnet has up to 10 weeks to make the changes the externals required.  I made the changes within 10 weeks as the externals indicated to me (by them not returnign the thesis to me) and the University refused to get the changes I made to externals to ALLOW externals to sign off on accepting the 120 point 1 EFT MPhil within 1 calendar year.  A University academic year is 34 weeks or 9 months including the external exam period.  So says the TEC which the Uni si required to listen to if they want to invoice studnet loans.  </p>

                <p>Prison camp.  There's nothign there.</p>

                <p>They re-enrol me for more fees for a programme I never applied to be enrolled in.  They kept me enrolled under `zero fee scheme' which was only for first year students.  Not for graduate students. </p>

                <p>Australasia does not have an education and training system.  STanford prison experiment.  Pick people arbitrarily or at random and assign or deploy them into position.  Ashley Bloomfield never applied to be enrolled in MD or PhD he has no research output he never wrote a thesis he is supposed to be professor, now?  Jacinda will write a book one day?  So she gets 3 fellowships she never applied for and she also never applied for PhD did not do the work for one and she never handed in a thesis and she has no research output.  What education and training system?  There's nothign there. </p>
