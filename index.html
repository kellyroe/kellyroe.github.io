                            <p> https://www.nzherald.co.nz/kahu/the-investment-into-maori-apprentices-has-turned-around-maori-unemployment-youre-hired/4NEY2WL5RNAQ5KJ2OSEYM7IZGE/  Do the apprentices get paid minimun wage for every week of their apprenticeship?  Or do the 'apprentices' have levels of debt recorded against their name, with the Inland Revenue Department, while the Government pays the 'training provider' to keep them on less than minimum wage?  How are they being kept as apprentices?  
                            </p>

                            <p>When do you think the Australian National University will get my academic work out for external examination?  I was disappointed to find that nobody was paid to supervise me.  No supervision meetings.  Nobody regularly gave me comments on my academic writing.  Nobody regularly gave me instructions to help me complete on time.  They were only interested in re re re re re enroling me.  Presumably for more and more money for the 'University'.  What 'University'?  Australia's premier research institution can't even / won't even get students work out for external examination.  Can't even / won't even employ people willing and or able to do their job and supervise their enrolled students.  Currently they say they refuse to accept that they didn't offer me supervison.  They say I have no evidence of that.  Not even trying to be a University, hey.   </p>

                            <p>I don't know if other studnets who were formally acknowledged as having done enough for PhD had their work sent out for external examination.  Firstly, I don't know if they ever recieved reports from external examiners or if the University just picked and chose and their work never went out at all.  I also think that Sterelny was likely taking work from some and crediting it to others.  He got sent a lot of work for publication in the Philosophy and Biology Journal.  It wouldn't surprise me if he was finding out who the studnets or people not on payroll were and delaying publication until they were  bullied into fleeing and then crediting other people with authorship of the work.  I wouldn't be surprised to learn that he wasn't the author of much of what he claims for himself in print.  I wouldn't be surprised to learn that his pets were given other studnets work.  I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the Australian National University was trying to pick out people most likely to go on to similarly staff prison camps around the world.  Not even trying to be a University.  Why would I want to go to University to have morning tea, afternoon tea.  Lunch.  Dinner.  Drinks.  WHERE IS MY SUPERVISION?  AT LEAST GET MY WORK OUT TO EXTERNALS IF YOU ARE TOO F*CKING STUPID OR PSYCHOPATHIC TO DO THE JOB FOR WHICH YOU ARE PAID.  There isn't anything there.</p>

                            <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/491068/lawyer-admitted-to-the-bar-despite-dishonesty-and-child-assault-convictions  Was he admitted to the bar 'despite' his offending, or was he admitted to the bar 'because of' his offending?  Was Dr Leeks employed by the government in spite of his offending, or because of his offending?  Was Kim Sterelny employed by the Australian National University because he got his studnets work out for external examination, or because he didn't?  How many doctoral theses did Carl Brusse have to write for the Australian National University to get credit for having done one?  How many times did he need to house-sit for Sterelny?  Go away with him on camping trips ffs.   </p>

                            <p>Don't worry Ministry of Education.  Using 'teachers' to grade studnets work can be unfair and discriminatory, too.  That's the point of them, isn't it?  To teach some studnets that the government expects them to take up positions as terrorist  bombers so that government leaders can go around the country passing and revoking laws under 'it's an emergency repeal the abortion laws post-haste' and people will look to leaders for comfort if only you can keep the people abused and deprived enough and turning on each other they will turn to you for comfort.  Right Jacinda?  Quite motivating and inspiring to see how the US people came together after the destruction of the twin towers.  If only there could be a arranged a more permanent state of overt war... The people would happily sit at home all day tuning into the Bloomfield show... </p>

                            <p>Australia seems to have changed the euthanasia laws.  At least, they have been advertising for people to do that as part of end life care.  I guess there were all those experiments about how people would simply follow instructions to kill someone else.  They can advertise the positions and see who will do them.  Who will be a surgeon for 'non-credit'.  Who will be a lawyer for non-credit?  See what opportunities present regarding who he can stick pins into and so on.  I wonder how the Nazi party advertised positions so that they had people happily working the death camps.  Apparently some of the employees were actually singing triumphant songs, and the like, while working those jobs.  They were having the time of their lives...  I guess you probably don't even need to pay them, then.  We could just call them apprentices, right Chris?  </p>

                            <p>It was genuinely surprising to me to learn the lengths that NZ would go to.  Refusing to process applications to enrol in Medicine.  Learning that the whole thing is a scummy scam, really.  They aren't graduating the studnets from those qualifications.  They aren't employing them to work those jobs.  What happened with that nurse..  When they got one applying for a job in New Zealand and they thought they could contact her employer overseas and have her fired or let go so that she'd have no other option but to be detained in NZ to 'work' for low to no pay...  The whole 'how low can we go' strategy or whatever you want to call it...</p>

                            <p>Is it because of cannibalism in the food chain?  Australia had this thing about the Fore people.  Observing the effects of the Australian Authorities forcing them to cannibalise each other.  They said they were doing it voluntarily, of course.  They weren't being forced to do it by the authorities.  Rather, it was culturally normal.  Kind of similar to the things Professor Glue wants to say about communal sleeping arrangements for Maaori.  We have got better, now, at being able to track Syphilis and the like.  Knowing which employees of the government passed it to who etc.  More formally documenting crimes...  So they can be most valued employees of the year.  I do wonder if it is the Kuru.  Plaques and tangles.  Neurodegenerative disease.  The leadership, I mean to say.  Those picked out to be paid and paid and paid and paid to keep prisoners or hostages or slaves or what have you.</p>

                            <p>They are making a better life for their children?  They think their children will have a glorious time being Lord of the death camps?  I don't really (I really don't) understand.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>
