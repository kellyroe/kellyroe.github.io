                            <article>

                            <p>
                            This website documents some of the academic work that I did for New Zealand, Australian, and American Universities.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I have requested the Australian National University supply me with the documentation they have on what supervision Kim Sterelny and the Philosophy Programme of the Research School of Social Sciences offered me and explain why it was that they gave me extensions and yet refused to progress me through the qualification and refused to grant me my PhD.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I have documented, here the work that I did for the University of Waikato, subsequent to that where I wrote for them a 120 point MPhil Masters Thesis and they went on to refuse to get it to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit them signing off on completion of that Degree.  They went on to get it out late requesting it be examined for the wrong qualification (doctoral rather than masters examination so it would be found to be 'too short').  They refused to allow the overseas based external examiner to sign me off and they refused to schedule an oral examination when he asked for that after seeing they refused to sign me off themselves.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I have also documeted a similar process occurring in the Courts of New Zealand.  They do not accept filings, they will not progress filings, they order case management conferences where the Judges instruct filings to be changed into things that are less likely to win and they refuse to progress cases through the courts.  

                            <p>
                            Here are my submissions to the Court of Appeal regarding the University of Otago:

                                <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>.  I post them here because the Courts say I am out of time because I did not pay them $7,060 by the deadline they set.  I post them here so you can judge for yourself whether the courts have or have not upheld justice.
                                </p>

                                <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings on grounds that it had already passed judgment on the filings and would not revisit the issue.  They did not think my filings sufficient to show there had been a grotesque injustice.  I post them so you can judge for yourself.  
                                </p> 

                                <p>
                                 Here is why I believe that New Zealand is a State of Australia (it is written into the Australian Constitution): <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  They do not progress my submissions.
                                </p>  

                                <p>
                                The Universities of Otago and Auckland are not being fair as to how they are choosing what students to enrol in Medicine.  I have documented how Otago unlawfully discriminates against applicants on the basis of disability (they are blatant about that being what they are doing) and I have documented how Auckland refuses to apply their published algorithm to applications.  That means that Dr Leeks wasn't the product of a fair algorithm.  He was hand-picked for displaying the qualities they have chosen to value.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The Universities and courts have broken the social contract.  The Courts have chosen to set precedent that it will cost upwards of $20,000 to take a case against the Univesrity to the High COurt and the High Court will not uphold Justice.  
                                </p>

                                <p>New Zealand keeps detention / slave camps.  New Zealand is a state of Australia.  Australia chooses to supply New Zealand Dollars to New Zealanders to prevent them travelling domestically and to disguise how low the wages are kept in New Zealand.  They will not pay the teachers, police, nurses, etc.  They do not value the lives of New Zealanders.  They keep slave / dention camps.  They do not allow qualification progression and completion.  They are not fair in their allocation of training places.  They are not fair in their process of advertising (if they even do) or appointing people for paid jobs.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Dishonest people live there.  They lie to prospective migrants and then they don't pay them.  They arrange for them to be abused.  They don't honor their part of the contract.  They don't progress the work they don't acknowledge the work.  They are not supportive or encouraging.  They don't acknowledge people's humanity.  They don't see people.
                                </p>
                        

                                <p> Here is a link to how he talks to me.  <a href="judicial-review/kim.pdf" target="_self"> Not supportive. </a>  I guess things are sooooooooo competitive now that an excess of an 8.0 GPA, several high quality writing samples including a high quality masters thesis, a publication with Oxford University Press is not enough to get an Australian Scholarship to so much as start a PhD!  
                                </p>  

                                <p>Apparently there are the people who do the work, and then there are the people who take all the money.  You can see it isn't about the research output at all.  I mean, it can't be that Sterelny thinks I'm incapable of producing research.  It has to be that it's soooooo competitive that by the time he's taken the money he thinks he's entitled to, there isn't any money left for the likes of me.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                They say if you get 1 million monkeys typing for 1 million years they will eventually produce the works of Shakespeare.  So, then, you need to start by making millions and millions and millions of monkeys...  It isn't good science.  Australia is not actually winning for how competitive it is supposed to be.  Design plans for submarines.  Design plans for vaccines.  Satellites.  What assistance was there for Tonga?  Covid infected marines...
