                            <p> https://www.nzherald.co.nz/kahu/the-investment-into-maori-apprentices-has-turned-around-maori-unemployment-youre-hired/4NEY2WL5RNAQ5KJ2OSEYM7IZGE/  Do the apprentices get paid minimun wage for every week of their apprenticeship?  Or do the 'apprentices' have levels of debt recorded against their name, with the Inland Revenue Department, while the Government pays the 'training provider' to keep them on less than minimum wage?  How are they being kept as apprentices?  
                            </p>

                            <p>When do you think the Australian National University will get my academic work out for external examination?  I was disappointed to find that nobody was paid to supervise me.  No supervision meetings.  Nobody regularly gave me comments on my academic writing.  Nobody regulrly gave me instructions to help me complete on time.  They were only interested in re re re re re enroling me.  Presumably for more and more money for the 'University'.  What 'University'?  Australia's premier research university can't even / won't even get studnets work out for external examination.  Can't even / won't even employ people willing and or able to do their job and supervise their enrolled students. </p>

                            <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/491068/lawyer-admitted-to-the-bar-despite-dishonesty-and-child-assault-convictions  Was he admitted to the bar 'despite' his offending, or was he admitted to the bar 'because of' his offending?  Was Dr Leeks employed by the government in spite of his offending, or because of his offending?  Was Kim Sterelny employed by the Australian National University because he got his studnets work out for external examination, or because he didn't?  How many doctoral theses did Carl Brusse have to write for the Australian National University to get credit for having done one?  How many times did he need to house-sit for Sterelny?  Go away with him on camping trips ffs.   </p>
