                                <p>When I get some time I will try and make light and dark themes my first Javascript project.  I think people have strong preferences either way on the color scheme thing, and I was looking for My First Javascript Project.  So, that might be a nice one.</p>

                                <p> Thanks for bearing with me while I am working through readability issues and figuring out color options. </p>
           
                                <p>You can contact me via the email address: email@kellyroe.org.
                                Yes, you probably read that correctly, 
                                my email address starts with the word "email".
                                I'll let you copy-paste that into whatever email programme you like.

                        <h2>Justice</h2>
                        
                            <div class="container">
                            <p>In 2018 I applied to the Public University of Waikato to be enrolled in a one year masters thesis.  I experienced a succession of problems with the University including (but not limited to) them not enrolling me in the programme I applied to; not getting theses I submitted for examination out to examiners in order to prevent and prohibit them signing off on my qualification completion; sending my masters thesis out to be examined for the wrong degree (requesting doctoral reports of the masters thesis); refusing to  base the outcome of examination on reports of external examiners; demanding re-enrolment and additional fees without grounds;  forcing me to work an additional period of labor without grounds; updating my transcript to record that I failed to meet the requirements of the Degree when I complained about the above as corrupt practice. </p>

                            <p>I have various cases of Judicial Review of Administrative Action (that you can follow over on the Judicial Review Tab) about, what I maintain are, corrupt practices, primarily within the Public Universities of New Zealand.  I have tried to get Government Prosecutors to prosecute, but they will not.  Police tell me that it is a civil matter.  Legal aid lawyers are not willing to take on a case for a civil applicant.  I have therefore been forced to slave for the courts (that is to say forced to labor without pay) as a self-represented civil applicant because New Zealand will not process applications for enrolment or employment; will not acknowledge completion of work with financial remuneration and / or qualification. </p>

                            <p>I have read a few High Court Judgments from the New Zealand Courts and mostly the judgments do not read to me like justice has been done yet.  I say that when the only thing I know about the High Court Judgment that I am reading is what is contained within the High Court Judgment itself.  I am not sure whether or if other people share that intuition with me, but that is the way that it often seems to me to be.  The court of appeal judgments read much better.  I am required to pay a bunch of money to the courts to have the cases heard on appeal, however, and it feels to me like the courts are trying to force me to abandon proceedings against what is, effectively, the executive branch of government.</p>  
                                
                            <p>In reading the High Court Judgments of the cases that I have brought before the courts the statements from the Justices seem to me to be more invitations for me to locate the piece of evidence that dis-proves that.  You might think 'well why, then, did you not supply that piece of evidence in the first place?'  The answer to that is that you don't really know what will turn out to be relevant in advance and sometimes it is in the bundle in fact but it is buried in the bundle such that even I (as a partial creator) have trouble locating it.  Bundles can become bloated with with things you thought might be relevant that turned out not to be even when you aren't trying to be unnecessarily complicated, at all.  Things have not been helped by the fact that I am self-represented (not by choice)</p>

                            <p>I see that things did not go well with the Supreme Court because they did not have pieces of evidence or the Courts had asserted things at an earlier stage in the proceedings and I did not properly respond to it.  Since I didn't properly respond to it they carried it forwards as accepted by everyone including me.  I need to copy-paste the Judgments of the Justices and the Decisions of the Registrars and go through more methodically.  It feels like I am saying the same thing over and over and I fall into a trap of thinking I need to explain it different because it isn't being accepted when I think often-times I really am just supposed to copy-paste.  That is to say trying to explain things differently isn't what I am supposed to be doing.  I am supposed to be copy-pasting because the content is being forwarded to another person to weigh in on, is all.  I don't need to try and explain it again to the same person.  I am not a lawyer so I'm not trained in how you are supposed to progress things through the courts.  I don't have templates of ideal filings for civil applicants for me to even try and emulate.
                            </p>

                            <p>It seems to me that the Supreme Court judgments are saying that decisions to require security for costs to be paid and filing fee to be paid and for permission to appeal judgment of costs be requested of the High Court were the judgments that were upheld.  That is to say, I need to do those things (pay monies and seek permissions) for the cases to proceed in the manner I have requested of the courts.  I have applied for the Ministry of Social Development to provide me with recoverable assistance for security for costs and filing fee to be paid.  Else it seems to me that the NZ Government would be denying me the essential item or need of Justice on the grounds that they have chosen to keep me poor-ly.  I document this for the world.  Hello world.  Would you like to do business with the New Zealand government?  Suppose the New Zealand government doesn't honor it's contract (that rule doesn't apply!  you are REQUIRED to follow the EXEMPTION which involves allowing things to run over-time for the extra billings / unpaid labour, paying the bribe or facilitation payment else things won't get done at all)...  What are you going to do about it?  Sue them?  In which court?  Can you possibly win costs in that court or only lose them?  Are you required to slave for that court because the New Zealand government did not give you a law degree?  Is that perhaps why you were chosen by the government to 'work' for that court? </p>
