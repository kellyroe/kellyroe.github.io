                            <p>I knooooow.  I'm too old to get a job.  Kim Sterelny at the ripe old age of 75+ won't get out, until..  Won't get out, until.  Payrolls won't stop until.  Death camp won't come until...</p>

                            <p>Apparently I'm 5 years post-graduation.  That means my qualification is no longer accepted (early onset dementia is ineviable. is the value of NZL qualifications) wereas their refusal to get out post 65 years is because of.... Nobody else could do it.  Everybody else's qualifcations expired because their qualifications go on into perpeptuity because garbage garbage nonsense no spik engleeesh they are too f*cking intellectually handicapped to see (while accusing everybody else thereof).  The dumb and dumber show..  Worse.  Worse... Where is Stuart McCutcheon?  Dawn Freshwater.  That sounds like a sensible name.  Like one your Mother would have given ya.  Not.  Not born in NZL.  Come here.  Nobody from NZL could possible work your job you f*cking retarded freak.  F*CK OFF.  Ooooh . I'm sorry.  That's not so polite.  Please F*ck off, mate, from the land from whence you come.  Go refuse to process aplciations on the basis of their acadaemic merits, back in England.  Only way you got into power -- right????</p>

                            <p>Don't get me wrong.  I respect my elders. Up until the point where I have accumulted evidence to show that THEY DO NOT RESPECT ME.  THEFOREFORE: :DIE>  YOU>  DIE>  F*CKING DIE.  ARE YOU F*CKING DEAD ALREADY>  WHAT THE F*CK IS WRONG WITH YOU YOU F*CKING FREAK YOU F*CKING RETARD???  HOw many hudnreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of salary for you each and every year you f*cking psychopath.  GET OUT!!! DIE!!! DIE!!! If that is what you require.  Then hurry up and f*cking well die, already.</p>

                            <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/fifa-womens-world-cup-2023/300938662/palmys-not-boring-mayor-invites-spanish-football-team-back-for-a-night-out WE JUST WANT TO PLAY SOCCER.  LOOK AT OUR GAME SCORES.  NO AMOUNT OF DRUGGING US TO ACCEPTANCE WILL HAVE US GIVE UP OUR DESIRE TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT GAME ALREADY FFS.  It really isn't that hard...  </p>

                            <p>I'm sorry..  National person got a leak (that they weren't supposed to have got and maybe it's not even true) but they broadcast it.  Which is what you do with a leak?  Um... I think the issue has not been introduced in a credible or responsible manner..  Something is amiss.  If they want to 'feel things out' then announcing a leak is not the appropriate manner or way in which to do so... WHY AM I EXPLAINING? :GET SOMEONE ON YOUR PAYROLL TO EXPLAIN THE BAIC SHIT TO YOU</p>

                            <p>Q for Sven...  I had a lot of fun in Temple of Elemental Evil.  One of the things I liked was that the dialogue options would tell you when you had them in virtue of a certain thing.  I mean, if you had dialogue options linked to having a certain number of skill points in a certain skill then they would tell you that.  Next to the dialogue option.  What that meant was that if you wanted to do a playthrough prioritising a particular thing, then you could see what dialogue options were there only because of it.  I don't really know what that would mean or how it would play out in or with cut-scenes.  But I mean to say that if one wants to have a 'dark urge' playthrough, for instance, will the 'dark urge' options be labelled as such?  Maybe it is obvious whether a dialogue option is only available because of dark urge..  But this might not be so obvious for some other dialogue options. For example.  Nature check?  Ranger?  Both?  I mean this so as to encourage?  Enable?  Allow?  Multiple playthroughs to experience the variety of different things that the game has to offer.  If you let people simply choose whatever they want they may fall back on their own personal stereotypes, or something.  Instead of them being able to commit to honoring their heritage..  Or something like that.  For out of character role playing...  That can be enjoyable.  And that encouage and support the development of a diversity of things.  Regardless of what the majority finds most natural.  Or easy.  Or similar.</p>
                            <p>__</p>

                            <p>http://ausconstitution.peo.gov.au/#covering-clauses  Hey, look, it's the Australian Constitution.  Check out: "6 Definitions".  See the part where it says 'The States shall mean such of the colonies of ...  New Zealand, as for the time being are part of the Commonwealth... </p>

                            <p>Whatever do you think it means?  </p>

                            <p>I think it means that we must remove literacy from the 'schools' post-haste.  Since it has already been provided that NZ is a State of the Federation of Australia on grounds of 'expediency'.  It was expedient to provide for the admission of NZ as a State of Australia on grounds of expediency.  </p>

                            <p>Where is my Australian Birth Certificate, then?  Where is my Australian Passport?  Where are my Australian Wages?  Not so expedient, now??</p>

                            <p>Ooooh.  It doesn't mean Australia HAS provided that, it means Australia might provide that.  Only if the people want it.  Where are the voting papers, then?  Where are the voting papers to  be supplied to the people born in NZ to see if they want to have Australian Birth Certificates and Passports and Wages and Medicines available via Medicare and HECS or HELP for Australian Universities?  Where are the voting papers to see whether the people want Aboriginal Voice to be entrenched?  Whether the people want Independence for New Zealand?  What democracy?  What rule by law?  What nuclear submarines?  Not in the next 15 years!!!  Nucleaer exclusion zone.  Not for you.  Can you imagine what would happen if the governments of NZ or Australia or both got their hands on nuclear weapons?  They really don't seem to care at all what the people think.  They don't even seem capable of reading their constitution.</p>

                            <p>----</p>

                            <p>Maybe Otago should explain to the NZ people why their Medical Degree, that is supposed to be 'competitive entry' on the basis of 'academic merits' is one where..  They say they didn't even calculate my GPA because 'other' or 'alternative' category accepts people who have never even studied at University level.  They are enrolling Australian Citizens into that programme.  Giving them NZ studnet loans.  Refusing ot allow NZ Citizens to get HELP or HECs loans to study in Australia.  Of course Australia is garbage, anyway.  Everybody knows you need to earn enough from you govt job to pay millions to Harvard so they can arrange for you to put on a ventillator when it's time to graduate you.  So that Dr Leeks and Dr Green..  The 10 day Orthopedic Hire for Canterbury..  Can be deployed into position.  For all the qualities it is that they value, one can only suppose.  Everything it is that they value.  Their values.  </p>

                            <p>___</p>


                            <p> <a href="writing/LAW 121B.pdf" target="_self">Law exam.</a>  </p>

                            <p>I wish I kept copies of the Population / Public Health essays that I wrote that were awarded 30 per cent only (I was failed for the entire course).  I personally don't think that they were appreciably worse than anything else I had done...  And I don't think that is coming from a position of bias.</p>

                            <p>Why did they fail me?  Because...  I didn't realise before-hand but the Population / Public Health pathway was a Maaori Pathway.  They had the people picked out who they wanted to do Medicine from that Pathway and they did not pick me.  Since I was passing Organic Chemistry etc they thought that the only way they could stop me taking what they believed they were entitled to was by failing me for the course -- so they could say that since I failed the course I was 'ineligible' to have applied.</p>

                            <p>At the end of the semester I dropped papers from the second semsester so I would end up with less than 120 points in that academic year.  That way I preserve my full time GPA.  That is how they define what full time and part time mean.  Your best 120 points per academic year.  If you haven't done 120 points then you don't have a full time GPA.  They think I am cheating that that is how they defined full time GPA and that was why I dropped back to part time.  But that was what they tried to do to me.  Ruin my GPA.  By failing me for Population / Public Health.  They forced me to flee the 'University'.  That is what University grades mean, according to them. They are discretionary things with no meaning.  Used to bully people around.  Arbitrary.  Not academic.  What University?  </p>

                            <p>How many other studnets are bullied into fleeing so that certain others are the only game in town?  The 'Universities' want to say people are leaving because of Covid.  But that doesn't seem plausible.  People (with capacity) are leaving because they are being bullied away.  Then the 'Universities' feel justified in simply not graduating the remainder.  They do the ethics tests and they enrol only those without ethics so they don't have to feel bad refusing to graduate them.  Why?  So the skilled labor jobs can be filled by Americans, I suppose.</p>

                            <p>In other words..  I suppose the only reason why I got first in class for the law exam was because I was enrolled in it as a general education paper (rather than as part of first year law) and they wanted to claim me.  They thought that I should pay and pay and pay and pay the 'University' so that they could...  Eventually...  Refuse to give me a law degree.  Else refuse to register me as a lawyer.  Else refuse to pay me as a lawyer.  You know how it goes.  You pay and you pay and you pay and you pay the 'University' until it is time for you to go away.  Because of all the 65 +++ year olds on payroll, still, and all the Americans who they see fit to give the NZ jobs to because there aren't any people here willing or able to be on payroll to do skilled jobs.</p>

                            <p>For example.  Brett Calcott married an American.  She was given employment by the University of Auckland so that she is paid to teach and research in Philosophy of Biology.  Why didn't they hire Brett (the NZ citizen) to work that job?  Or why didn't they hire Ben (the NZ citizen) to work that job?  Or why didn't they hire John Matthewson (the NZ citizen) to work that job?  Why did they choose to hire an American?  I thought we were only supposed to hire foreigners when there isn't anyone from NZ willing or able to work the job.  What was wrong with the NZers?  I'm pretty sure that any of them would have really really really wanted that job.  It would have given Brett financial independence...  Though, I don't know about Brett...  Is the idea that everybody sends their work to Kim Sterelny in his capacity as editor of the Philosophy of Biology journal..  Then he can delay publication until the people not already on payroll give up and go away or die or whatever.  Then he can reattribute authorship to people already on payroll. Or maybe reattribute authorship to the people he likes to party with, or something.  I mean to say, maybe Brett doesn't really have Phlosophy output.  Maybe he just does webpage stuff so that they can take take take the research outputs of some and reattribute them then to people who don't have the willingness or ability or whatever to have research output to record research output against their name.  I don't know.  It's soooo competitive, apparently.  Soooo competitive I should be run out of town!!</p>

                            <p>I suppose that now what happens is that Penn takes over the Philosophy of Biology Journal.  A former graduate of Penn gets employed by the University of Auckland.  The University of Auckland studnets work gets piped directly to Penn by way of Brett's wife ensuring that it all gets uploaded to Turnitin.  That's a great idea.  The USA can just take all the creative outputs and all the intellectual properly of the NZers.  Hand it to the particularly dim-witted Americans to pass off as their own.  Ingenious.</p>

                            <p>So, the 'University' of Auckland tells me that if I'm not going to apply on the basis of Health Science First Year (which I couldn't do since they said I failed the population health paper) I'd need to do an entire new qualification, instead.  I'm clearly not going to re-enrol in anything to do with Public Health.  Flee from Tamaki campus.  That's for sure.  Not a University, hey.  Not even trying to be.</p>

                            <p>So I apply to a 120 point 1 EFT MPhil with the University of Waikato.  I apply by the application deadline.  I get an auto response from the University acknowledging that they have received my application.  It is the day before the stated deadline by which applications must be received.  They then proceed to alter the time stamp and accuse me of being late.  They refuse to enrol me in the programme I applied to, by the application deadline.  Instead they offer me enrolment in a programme that I never applied to (with different enrolment dates).  What is the problem,  here?  How many other people applied to do a 120 point 1 EFT MPhil with the University of Waikatko in 2018?  I bet (I don't know, but I bet) the answer to that is:  0.  I bet...  That I was the ONLY person to have applied to that programme of study.  So, why won't they enrol me in the programme of study to which I had applied?  Are they afraid that I will fail?  They decided they were going to fail me before they even enrolled me.  What University?  There isn't anything there, at all. </p>

                            <p>Why do I think that nobody else applied to do a 120 point MPhil?  Becuase...  Now I'll tell you what the University Administration (the Vice Chancellor's etc) think about the 'University' education that is provided by their institution.  They think it is a bums on seats thing.  They think the students goal or aim or target is to be doctor by age of 25.  They think that their job (the job of the 'University') is to do everything they can to stop them.  Delay them.  Both of those.  Why?  Because until they are 25 they pay the University else they subsistence live.  But once they are doctors they will be rich.  Right?</p>

                            <p>So the studnets are all racing racing racing to grubby grub the little piece of paper qualification before they turn 25...  So to get there you have 18, 19, 20.  That is your 3 year under-grad degree.  21.  That's your honors year.  That's the equivalent of a 4 year college degree.  Now you are allowed to drink alcohol.  Congradulations.  22, 23, 24.  That's the 3 year PhD.  Will you actually get to graduate before you turn 25?</p>

                            <p>Masters degrees are for losers.  Haha.  Loooosers.  People who didn't have the honors grades to proceed directly to PhD.  Hahahahaha you aren't going to make doctor before you turn 25.  You loooose.  Looooooser.  I mean to say that nobody voluntarily chooses to enrol in a masters when they could enrol in a doctoral degree.  Masters degrees are what you enrol in when you don't get entry to doctoral programme.  </p>

                            <p>A little note here...  Your realising the above is supposed to have you go 'awwwwww.  I loose.  Awwww.  Better luck next generation.  Now I know what the game is, at least.  I can just marry my supervisor or someone else's and better luck next generation!  WHy don't I give up my life for someone else with the promise of part of me (the part that vicariously lives through my child) can have all of the things I want for myself.  I can force my child to do everything it is that I always wanted and the world will be a better place becuase of this ideology!)  Hahahahaha they fooled me into thinking that wasting my time with a masters was something to do and then hahahahaha I was too old for their tastes.  Best try and get the next generation in as very very special children.  The litle  boys off to Oxford at 7 for the men in the maths department, or music department, or similar.  Off to choir boys practice...</p>

                            <p>That is the thinking of the University administration.  So...  They refused to accept that I'd applied to do a masters degree.  Why?  Because I'd f*cking well done one already.  Also  because if they ranked me for doctoral or PhD I probably would have been their highest ranked applicant or candidate.  How do they rank their applicants or candidates?  On the basis of GPA?  My full time GPA for undergrad and honors year of my BA(hons) was 8.6.  I had a book chapter with OUP.  Published.  Already.  Before I applied to do a MPhil with Waikato.  How many of their doctoral applicants had publication, do you suppose?  They refused to accept that I applied to study a 1 EFT qualification only.</p>

                            <p>When I applied to Medicine with Auckland in 2019 they firstly tried to not offer me an interview.  I have to phone them up and yakkity yak yak yak yak about what the GPA cut off was and about how I exceeded that...  So interviews had already started before I get them to finally offer me an interview...  So I can book super expensive flights from Dunedin (where I was) to Auckland...  They didn't f*ck up my GPA by failing me for Population Health.  Turns out.  Took them a while to get there.  Not the brightest.  Hey. </p>

                            <p>Where is the research output of the people on payroll to do research?  Where is it?</p>

                            <p>The Australian National University kept Carl Brusse enrolled for more than 10 years.  Refusing to send the work that he had done out for external examination.  Getting more and more money from the government for keeping him enrolled.  Takign more and more work from him.</p>

                            <p>Nick Southwood said that the external examiners of his thesis did not request him to make a single change.  That seems suspicious to me.  Did he really get reports from external examiners?  I would have thought they would have thought that in order for them to be seen to be doing their job properly they would have suggested at least one change so they could feel that they added value by being external examiners.  I don't remember hearing anybody at the ANU defend their thesis to external examiners.  I don't think a single thesis defence was scheduled.  THey aren't allowing anybody to have their work externally examined by someone independent.  What education and training system?  There isn't anyting there.  It is sooooo competitive that there's simply nothing there, at all.</p>

                            <p>All these people over the age of 65 on payroll.  People who have had government payroll for more than 40  years.  They won't get out.  They want to say that nobody else could do what they do so we are forced to put up with their psychopathic selves.  However many generations need to die for their psychopathic selves. </p>

                            <p>They deserve the aged care systems etc that they invested in.  THey thought they were for other people.  But they should be the first to be signed up for the death camps that they made.  F*cking psychopaths.  There's nothing here.  Quite by design.  F*cking psychopaths, hey.  Not even trying to be fair.  Die so that other can have a life, for a change.  F*cking hurry up and die.  It isn't anything you didn't want for me.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                            <p>Can't even process an application to enrol.  *It's not supposed to be that hard*.</p>

                            <p>The Statutory Laws of NZ say that people are entitled to a free secondary education up until the age of 20 years.  But the Universities have chosen to market to teenagers to have ever increasing levels of debt recorded against their name.  They enrol them in programmes they never applied to and don't even grade their work properly, much of the time.  They feel justified in failing students who clearly have capacity because they are bullies.  It's soooo competitive and the teachers / graders want to eliminate the competition so they can be the only game in town.  It's sooooo compeititive!</p>

                            <p>Statutes are supposed to be for the protection of a group.  The Education and Training Act states that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible for enrolment in the programme they have applied to.  But the Universities like them young.  Preferentially enrolling teenagers.  Saying they are entitlted to enrol teenagers and throw away applications from domestic adults.  They say they managed to get soooo many applications from teenagers (after spending however many hundreds of thousands if not millions on advertising and propaganda) that they are entitled to preferentially enrol teenagers.  Or Australian Citizens.  They can just do anything anything anything they like. </p>

                            <p>And the courts say that Ms Roe did not complete an MPhil in 2018.  Becuase the Uni was entitled to refuse to get it to externals because 1 year is a 'truncated enrolment' that Ms Roe was not entitled to.  She was forced to spend how many years working on a doctoral qualification?  With no scholarship.  Indefinately detained in the name of 'disabiltiy'.  F*cking psychopaths.  There's really nothing in Australasia.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  Can't even parse their constitution.  But then I guess I wrote my thesis on disability and equity in Medicine and Public Health BEFORE the former studnets of Harvard and UNC, Chapel Hill took the Universities to court for race based admissions.  Correct?  And NZL and Australia must  be forced to follow however many decades or hundreds of years behind the US.  So they could send us all the ....  How is the obgyn for Invercargil working out?  I thought she was doing to be doing media con-munications.  How is she going with prescribing birth control for the victims of the government employed pedophiles to ensure no lasting evidence of their crimes (aside from the pathology STD or HPV transmission, of course).</p>

                            <p>It's just great that we get 'Dawkins selfish genes' yes.  Selfish, selfish, selfish.  You are sooooo selfish, that's right.  How old are you?  Still on payrolls?  Please, Dawkins, come to New Zealand and preach about your 'God Delusion' and how Maaori cultural beliefs are akin to God Delusions.  Maybe get Robert Nola to write a little something something (how old is he)?  Rosalind Hursthouse?  How old is she?  Who else is there in the Auckland department over 65?  How old is Kim Sterelny?  HOw about is wife?  Still on payroll.  I wonder where all the money goes...  Are we still payrolling their parents, too?  Wouldn't surprise me.  Their children, I'm sure.  Or maybe they like to keep their children and their children's children etc etc as slaves in their houses, still. Who knows the extent of their selfish.  Maybe get the Penn hire to write about the relationship between Maaori cultural beliefs and science.  Tell us how it is for the new generation.  Clearly nobody from New Zealand could work that job.  Certainly not..  Tahua.  Say.  How many years was he required to work on his doctoral thesis?  I know you claimed he was too depressed for you to acknowledge his work for a number of years.  ANd then he had cancer which meant you didn't acknowledge his work through that, either.  Which brings on more depression, I suppose.  Did you ever manage to find a payroll for him?  Or his wife, only.  Like how Brett is dependent on his US wife for the NZ payroll?  Is that the idea/l?  Is Ben Jeffares payrolled?  Or he has to live with Jo, really, whether he wants to or not.  FInd any more 'orphans' to claim at the airport?    </p>

                            <p>F*cking psychopaths.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                            <p>I understand why THEY don't want ME to be a doctor.  THEY think -- we would never help you.  We wouldn't even show you the most basic courtesy of professionalism.  So why would you help us?  Why wouldn't you treat us as badly as we have treated you?  In fact, why wouldn't you treat us worse - if you had opportunity.  Nothing that we wouldn't do to you if the positions are reversed.  Because they are psychopaths, you see.  </p>

                            <p>The thing they don't understand is that they aren't the only people in the f*cking world.  Other people are not as psychopathic as them.  And some other people could use a little help.  ANd I could help them.</p>

                            <p>But if I want to help people, the psychopaths think, then I am just begging them to help themselves to me.  </p>

                            <p>F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                            <p>I was always happy and pleased for them when things went well for them.  THe same could not be said for them with regards or respect to me.  They took delight in my being bullied out and away. It's soooooo competitive.  F*cking psychopaths.  Not room enough in the world for the both of us, they say.  So I'm forced to go away.  Did Rachel and Nick get reports from external examiners regarding their thesis?  How about Daniel Stoljar?  I am curious...  If there were reports they would have them.  So I suppose they know, themselves.  If they have reports from examiners then how come my work wasn't sent out for external examination.  Why didn't I get the same courtesy that they did?  You don't get to say that it didn't go out because it was garbage because by refusing to send it out you are effectively trying to fail me yourself.  But that wasn't for you to decide.  It was for external examiners who could assess it for it's academic merits irrespective of whether or not I'd slaved as long as Carl or brushed Sterelny's cats or math tutored his kid or...</p>

                            <p>Tim Dare and others used to say 'the present lot will have to die before there will be a job for you'.  Well.  If that is the game you choose to play -- hurry and up and die, then.  No.  I don't want to work in aged care.  That is on you.</p>

                            <p>Divide and conquer.  Everybody knows.  I didn't now or think that I was the best student.  I thought I was one of the studnets.  But let's all get together and throw rocks at Kelly - right, Sterelny.  It's soooooo competitive.  It's soooooo competitive!  It's such a f*cking hostile world and I'm a selfish prick.  Oh yes.  You are.  Hurry up and die you selfish prick.  How many years of payroll for you?  Time to get the f*ck out.</p>

                            <p>The US diplomat guy wants to say that US is all about upholding rule by law.  Really.  He can read the Australian Constitution, then?  He read the part about NZ being a State of Australia?  So why does the US greet Jacinda Ardern as Prime Minister of New Zealand rather than Premier of New Zealand?  Where is our supposedly democratically elected leader, anyway?  Presently on US terrain after having resigned all voluntarily-like after being offered a million dollars, or something, from Harvard.  Where is our democratically elected Mayor of Wellington?  Her dog has been issued a US swipe card for building access some government building in New York?  She's presently on US terrain, as well.  Where are the voting papers for people born in NZ, if you support rule by law and you've read the Australian Constitution.  WHy don't New Zealanders get to vote in the upcoming election to change the Australian COnstitution to provide a voice to aboriginal people?  Where are the voting papers for the people Australia regards to have New Zealand Citizenship?  Not even trying to be rule by law.  Not going to get nuclear submarines anytime in the next 15 years.  You know that the governments would only use things like that as a weapon against the people.  The governments don't want the people to have reading, writing, arithmetic.  Because they know full well they do not have the support of the people.  Because they are trying to f*cking well exterminate us all.  Makes the very very very very very best sense of pretty much everything it is that they choose to do.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                            <p>What do they think..  Maybe as much as 1/4 of the population of RI are people kept in detention camps in RI.  THat means there is likely to be more.  Undocumented people, or people who have had their documentation taken away.  Prisons.  Asylum camps.  Not federal psychiatric hospitals because there aren't supposed to be any federal psychiatric hospitals.  Quickly quickly reclassify them as neurology patients.  Fill up the aged care institutions.  Put the children in detention camps and keep them out of school.  Detention camps.  Prison camps.  *There's nothing there*.  Not the developed world at all.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>
