                            <p>
                            The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications.  They define a 120 point program of study (e.g., the 120 point MPhil program of study that I applied to be enrolled in) as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a>.  Despite this, New Zealand Universities do not allow graduate research students (particularly) to complete their graduate research in a timely fashion.  In order to prevent and prohibit timely completion they refuse to get work to external examiners and they also believe they have authority to fail studnets at their own discretion if students attempt to submit their work in time for timely completion. 
                            </p>


                            <p>  
                            The University of Otago believes they have discretion to throw away applications without considering them on their merits.  Reasons they have for throwing them away include whatever arbitrary reasons they want including information they have about disability or race:
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  The Justice for the High Court Proceedings was one who seems to have been pulled out of retirement in order to hear this case.  The government chooses to get judges out of retirement rather than appointing new judges. 
                            </p>


                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings on grounds that it had already passed judgment on the filings and would not revisit the issue.  They did not think my filings sufficient to show there had been a grotesque injustice in how they handled my filings.  I post them here so that you can judge for yourself.  
                                </p> 

                            <p>
                            The Australian Constition explicitly mentions New Zealand as a State of the Federation of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  
                            The constitution states that it is expedient to consider certain states to be part of the Federation despite them not having consented to be part of the Federation.  I understand the Government of New Zealand does not want to regard itself to be the Government of a State of the Federation of Australia.  But who cares what the Government wants.  The New Zealand Government doesn't seem to care that New Zealanders don't have access to Medicines that Australians get access to.  THe New Zealand Government seems very happy to sell out the health of the people of New Zealand.  The New Zealand Government seems happy that there is no Federal Funding towards the running of our public schools and hospitals etc.  I do not understand how it is lawful for Australia to require New Zealanders to have Visa to live and work in other States.  I do not understand how it is lawful for them to take back the Visa's and deport New Zealanders prohibiting them from travelling inter-state.  I do not see how it is lawful to print a New Zealand Dollar Currency.  It seems to me to be only a thin attempt to disguise or conceal just how low New Zealand Wages are kept.  I don't see how it is lawful to withhold voting papers from New Zealanders.  I don't see how it is lawful to withhold places in training programmes.  I don't see how it is lawful to withhold Australian Birth Certificates or Passports.  I don't see how it is lawful to exclude New Zealanders from standing for Federal Government or working for Federal Government or standing for Federal Election. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I don't understand.  Is it that New Zealand gets cheap deals on some Medicines etc in virtue of crying 'poor' on the world stage..  And then those Medicines can be shipped to Australia and used over there.  That seems likely.  Australia treats New Zealanders as second class citizens.  The idea seems to be to have New Zealanders believe they are forced to flee New Zealand and they can take up their place as second class Australians to work all the jobs that Australaians don't want.  It seems to me that there is a real race to the bottom.  That makes the best sense to me of why Dr Leeks was harbored in Melborne.  Why Harlene Hayes was hired in Western Australia.  Why Kim Sterelny was hired by the ANU.  The prevention and prohibition of the development of Australia.  The preference for keeping of slaves.  I guess I didn't realise just how 'white Australia' Australians were.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The Universities of Otago and Auckland are not being fair as to how they are choosing what students to enrol in Medicine.  It wasn't that Dr Leeks (Dr Green etc) happened to slip through a selection criterion or process objectively and fairly applied.  It was that he or they was or were hand-picked or specially chosen for demonstrating all the qualities it is that they value.  I suppose, then, Dr Leeks was transferred to Melborne because that is also what they value over there.  I don't see what else we are supposed to think about that when they harbor him they way they have chosen to.  They are not even trying to be fair.  They appear to be trying to select people who will use their position to bully and abuse and commit violent criminal acts.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The Universities and courts have broken the social contract.  The Courts have chosen to set precedent that it will cost upwards of $20,000 to take a case against the University to the High Court, and even then they work to delay and obstruct and prohibit and prevent justice.  The judiciary does not appear to function.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I started a PhD with the Australian National University.  They chose to offer me Australian Government Funding (APA) in order to do a PhD with the ANU.  They chose to do this after seeing how I worked at the ANU as a Summer Research Scholar.  They chose to give me a VC Award so I could travel to UNC, Chapel Hill for an academic year and do coursework and teaching in the USA.  But my Supervisor (Kim Sterelny) wrote a Slavery Manifesto during my time there ('The Evolved Apprentice') with a lovely cover of giving a monkey a peanut.  I was bullied into leaving the University without receiving a PhD.  Apparently there wasn't any point giving me a PhD because there never would be a job for me.  Apparently I would need to wait until the older generation died before there would be a job for me!  I post my PhD work on this site (on the writing and seminar page).  I applied to START a PhD with the ANU for 2022 and my application was declined.  Apparently I haven't even done enough work to START a Phd with the ANU!  I can't wait to see the CV of the new intake of students to their PhD programme!  The publications they must have, already!  Or maybe the ANU acts in bad faith in the way in which it treats at least some of their students.
                            </p>

                            <p> They are getting my student records together to get back to me.  Apparently they have them already, I don't know why they need so much more time before releasing them.  I guess that's their job.  The money goes around the way the money goes around and since the money is going around the way the money goes around their primary job is to waste everybody else's time.
                            </p>


                            <p>
                            Otago has recently claimed that a reason why graduation was cancelled and we didn't see any research students publically credited with having completed their research qualification was because they received threats of violence from a former student.  It does occur to me 'there is no excuse for threats of violence'.  But it also occurs to me that there is no excuse for how Otago has chosen to treat it's students.  I feel so sad for that girl who was failed by Otago 2 years in a row.   What options are there for students or employees or slaves or volunteers when people who have kept them working or studying do not honor terms and when the courts refuse to uphold the law?      
                               </p>

                               <p>
                                The Education and Training Act 2020 and the Education Acts prior to that all stated that domestic adults who had attained the age of 20 years were eligible to  be enrolled in the programme they applied to.  They stated that teenagers (under the age of 20 years) were able to be enrolled by the University only if the University was satisfied that they were able to complete the course.  So, when we hear of a Univerity being satisfied enough that a teenager could complete the course so as to enrol them and take their money and we then hear of the University failing them for their course not only once, but two years in a row, then it really looks like the University has some explaining to do as to how it was that they could not pass the student.  The High Court of Dunedin did not see it that way because the Judges don't seem willing or able to understand justice.

                                The New Zealand Government has chosen to create and impose incentive structures incentivising slavery.  Preventing and prohibiting the development of training systems and skilled labor.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgement_of_Solomon  This is what justice looks like.  I don't know that many people, within New Zealand, would even know what justice would look like.  The ruling of a wise judge.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                https://journal.nzma.org.nz/journal-articles/an-ethical-dilemma-informed-consent-balancing-patient-dignity-and-medical-student-participation-in-sensitive-examinations  I guess the situation is more likely to be like this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNedXZ3vHZQ  Nobody had to tell the Nazi doctors to sing while they marched people off to the death-camps.  They did their work with joy in their hearts.  You just can't teach these things.  The New Zealand Medical Students (some of them) hesitate.  That's how you can tell who won't be graduating with their Medical class.  Or, even if they do, they won't be selected for further training.  Or, even if they are, they won't be signed off from having completed it.  But even if they are, they won't be shoulder tapped for employment.  But even if they are, they won't pay them.  
                                </p>

                                  <p>
                                There is no 'ethical dilemma'  between 'educational opportunities' on the one hand, and upholding informed consent (treating the patient with dignity), on the other.  This is because you are not teaching students how to perform intimate examinations or surgeries when you are requiring the students perform sexual and physical assaults.  If you don't know the difference between an intimate exam and a physical or sexual assault then you need to stand down.  I didn't properly appreciate that abortion was criminal until 2020.  In practice, they just got someone signing off that the woman would suffer mental distress if she didn't get the abortion she wanted and in that way they were all approved on mental health grounds.   But they were delayed, first, of course, so the teenage boys could get to experience being renegade women's rights warriors or liberators not wanting the word to get out how many abortions they'd done in case their lives were endangered by the anti-abortionists.

                                I think it is incredibly tone deaf for Jacinda Ardern to have accepted an honorary PhD in Law from Harvard University.  I understand Harvard is a private University and they have the power to grant honorary Degrees.  But the public Universities of New Zealand are not being honest in their dealings with students.  Particularly, they are failing students out of the University even when the students have met requirements for qualification completions.  They are refusing to get studnets work to external examiners, for example, so as to prohibit the external examiners from signing off on qualification completions.  Very recently Otago claimed to have needed to cancel graduation because they recieved threats of terrorism.  It turned out that a former studnet had been failed by the University 2 years in a row and she didn't want her parents to know she wasn't going to be graduating.  The Courts refused to hold the University accountable for failing her for 2 years in a row.  The Education Act says that they are only to enrol studnets under the age of 20 if they believe they can meet the requirements of the qualification.  They enrolled her and took her money.  I assume she was under 20.  This is the context in which Jacinda believes it is appropriate for her to be receiving an honorary PhD Degree in Law from the USA.  A programme that, I believe, is a 5 year programme with 2 years of course work and a 3 year thesis.  NZ Universisties do not keep accurate records on how they refuse to allow students to complete graduate research qualifications.  They say there is no point signing them off because there never will be jobs for them.  But there are jobs advertised around the world for post-docs and so on.  It isn't about that, at all.  It is about holding people (preventing them leaving) in conditions of deprivation.  Refusing to pay them and also refusing to give them the qualifications so that someone else may pay them.  It is about keeping slaves.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I understand that it is the Universities of New Zealand who are refusing to follow the law.  I also understand that Crown Law refuses to prosecute them for refusing to follow the law.  E.g., Waikato kept false documents about me.  False transcripts.  Misuse of an official document with them refusing to examine my thesis.  Hoarding it in their basement and refusing to get it to externals.  Squawking that it was 'too early' and they had the power to declare me failed outright.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                International community needs to do something about the child trafficking.  That is what NZ's 'education system' amounts to, when it refuses to progress studnets through their qualifications and refuses to sign them off.  People need to be honestly informed that NZ is not honoring it's contracts in the Education Sector.  Students are (in some instances) being arranged to be raped and deported with no qualification at all.  They will not enrol students in a timely fashion, they will not progress studnets through their qualifications, they will not sign off on qualification completions.  They are not honest in their dealings, at all.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I have recorded on this website how the University of Waikato refused to progress me through the 120 point MPhil programme that I applied to in 2018.  They just refused to do it.  Bullied me every step of the way saying that I wasn't to do it.  They weren't going to let me do it.  I couldn't do it.  They wouldn't let me do it.  Just horrible awful hideous nasty...  This is not an education system.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Waikato seemed to think they were entitled becuase of how the ANU got me fleeing rather than granting me a PhD.  I don't have good documentation around my ANU PhD.  I have documentation of at least some of my work that I supply here.  I can see the amount of work starting strong in my first and second year (of a 3 year degree where examination likely takes around 1 year).  But then my work isn't being progressed, at all.  So...  What are you supposed to do?  Cry cry cry cry cry to your supervisor 'please do your job!  pretty pretty please with bribes on top?'  I don't understand how it is supposed to go.  Anyway...  At least some of the work that I did is here.  I don't really remember any supervision meetings.  I don't think I have in my first two years any concrete feedback on my writing or my thesis where my supervisor is actually helping me with concrete suggestions of what I need to do by what date to complete the PhD on time.  I don't know why they paid anybody from the ANU to supervise me.  The ANU got money from the Australian Government for having me.  Of course they did.  And I'm not threat to them applying for research funding grants or anything like that since I don't even have a PhD.  I must be quite stupid all the work I've done for low to no to slave wages.
                                </p>

                                <p>Kim Sterelny would joke about how NZ doesnt believe in bonding -- they believe in branding.  The idea being that you don't say 'work for us (for actual wages) for, say, 8 years to pay off the investment in your training'.  Rather, they believe in branding.  Label the student retarded so that nobody nobody nobody will want them or pay them anything at all.  
                                </p>

                                <p>Philosophy was something that I enjoyed when there were people doing it who were intellectually curious and putting time and effort into their work.  I enjoyed hearing about what people were working on and I enjoyed sharing with others what I had been working on.  But then some people got a lot of money to keep slaves, or some nonsense.  And it wasn't enjoyable for me anymore.  It was all about grubby grubby grubs grubby grubbing the money.

                                I wanted to do Medicine because apparently there is a shortage of Medical Doctors.  I wanted to learn the information so that I could make informed decisions about my own health etc.  Use that knowledge to help others  be informed and help others make decisions about their health, as well.  But turns out that it's soooooo competitive.  Because there's money in those hills, too.  For some people.  I thought I was making a personal sacrifice.  Giving up a paid career in Philosophy in exchange for more student years where I wouldn't have as much money as people who wanted a paid career more than learning Medicine.  But turns out that people think actually slavery will be a better life for me.  I can slave for less than minimum wage cry cry crying to the courts while they label me retarded and criminal and looney and...  Anything anything anything at all.  Just so long as the money keeps rolling their way.  It's all about the money.  The money the money the money the money the money the money the money.  And the keeping of slaves.

                                I don't think that the University of Waikato and also the Waikato District Health Board are being honest or fair in how the research funding goes around.  The money doesn't seem to be going from the Government to the Students.  I think that Waikato is keeping false records about their Graduate Student Enrolments.  I think they are getting government money for made-up students.  My evidence for this is in how they have chosen to keep records of my enrolment.  They recorded that I was enrolled in various things I never even applied to be enrolled in.  They say that 'privacy' means they can't tell me what data is data they are recording for me, specifically.  But it seems to me they are double-billing for me (at least).  They are supposed to offer Masters Scholarships (value of around $5,000) and the DHB also advertised a scholarship of about that value for a Masters student.  They did not give me any scholarship.  They were supposed to be academic merit based but they say that they thought the quality of my research proposal was (as judged by them) not good enough so they gave the scholarships to students with lower GPA.  I don't see any evidence or reason to believe that the money was awarded to any actual students, at all.  I don't know if the corruption is that the government doesn't get the money to the University (or the DHB).  Or if the corruption is that the University (or the DHB) don't get the money to the student.  They take the Masters, maybe, they take the research proposals, certainly.  Then they hoard them for themselves.  Maybe even supply the work to the government claiming they are the author.  After they have bullied the student away.  I think that is what is going on.  They are stealing the students work.  That's why they bully them away.  I don't know if my work (on the seminars and writing page) was given to other of Sterelny's students.  If that is why he seems really really really really determined to keep me bullied away.  I think I remember one of his studnets saying that it wasn't about who did the work -- it was about who got credit for the work that had been done.

                                I guess one indicator is the quality of the references.  Martin Davies would not write me a reference in support of PhD applications to the USA.  But he said he would put in a good word for me with the ANU and the ANU offered me a scholarship funded place.  In other words, I was good enough for them to want to keep me but they refused to write me a reference for me to be able to get away.  There is this thing about 'conversational implicature' in Philosophy.  Someone writes someone a reference and says they get their work done on time.  The implication is supposed to be that the work is garbage because all that was said was that the work was done on time.  The work must be done late late late late late late late.  The really really greats...  Well, they die poor.  Nobody acknowledges them until they are dead and buried.  Right?  Our very very very very best students.  The retarded criminal vagrants.  Can't even get their work acknowledged as done, on time!

                                New Zealand doesn't have Medical Doctors because Medicine is something that you pay the University to be enrolled in.  You never stop paying, you never stop paying, you never stop paying.  And for that, you get to say 'I am a Medical Student' or you get to say 'I am a Medical Doctor' and people go 'wow' and drop their panties (voluntariliy or not).  When it is time for you to stop paying the University it is time for you to go away.  You will be replaced by another student who will pay the University, will pay the University, will pay the University...  There isn't a training programme.  There is the keeping of slaves (kind of worse -- because the slaves not only labor for no pay but they actually pay their 'employers'.  That is the level of the psychological abuse.  Where you actually pay your employer.)  It is sort of an anti-economy. THe prevention and prohibintion of an economy.  Where you don't even pay the workers.  THey pay you.

                                What are we supposed to do?  Leave?  But we have to pry the money out of your cold dead fingers before we go?  I don't really understand...  I really don't like this game, at all,  that the people with the money and power insist that everybody play.

                                And, of course, that's what the courts are doing, now, too.  They say they don't accept my filings -- I need to re-file my filings.  There needs to be a case management conference with a yakkity-yak-yak with a Judge so they can change the issue into one that makes me look vexatious or frivilous.  I look at the quality of my earlier filings -- and the quality was quite good.  Then I look at the gaslighting documents that I get out of the courts instructing me to re-file my filings worse and worse and worse.  Degenerate filings.  Of a degenerate (me).  I guess it's part of the whole terrorist training or breeding programme that New Zealand has got going on.  It is like New Zealand is a primate research laboratory study in deprivation.  Harry Harlow research lab come to life.  The pit of despair, and so on.  Nobody likes baby monkeys, anyway, right?

                                <p>The Auckland District Health Board sends me these:  <<a href="judicial-review/adhb.pdf" target="_self">Bill for your involuntary detention</a>.  The courts chose to progress their application to have my proceedings against them (pertaining to unlawful detention) thrown out without a substantive hearing.  The Judge said that the evidence I supplied seemed to support my claim that they had unlawfully detained me.  So he did not throw the proceedings out.  He ordered the proceedings to be 'stayed', however, and instructed me to re-file my filings.  Never stop re-filing the re-filing of the re-filing of the filings, Ms Roe!  Never stop contributing to the increasing increase of the increase of the court costs to increase the workload of the courts so that judges need to be pulled out of retirement and put back on payroll to deal with your refiling of the refiling of the refiling of the refilings.  I have no idea why the ADHB is adding additional money now, that they think I owe.  Perhaps the idea is that the NZ Government (and the courts) seem to have decided that I'm sufficiently non-person for them to make up whatever documentation they like.  I wonder if next month they will send an invoice with $100,000 added to it?  Maybe another district health board will jump on the bandwagon of sending me bills?  Maybe the schools of New Zealand?  Maybe some University I've never been to will send an invoice to the Inland Revenue for even more to  be charged against my studnet loan?  What the hell, New Zealand.  What the f*ck.  Seriously.  The judge is supposed to judge the issue that was brought before him, in writing.  The courts think the judges get to change the issue from the one that was brought  before them to a different issue.  So then they can basically use the courts time to make up whatever stuff they like.

                                I guess NZ goes to California to cry cry cry for handouts.  So that we can use Microsoft Office to run a government and courts and health boards etc.  Exel.  Microsoft word.  Gmail.  Microsoft rooms.  THe documentation of what was actually filed and the works in progress of the judiciary.  New Zealadn does not appear to have a functioing administration.  But then, neither does Australia.

                                <p>SHORT STORY ~~~  There once was a Leader who found that the people loved her more (and more and more) the more she got to comfort the people ~~ in the wake of a terrorist attack.

                                New Zealand Universities are not upholding the law.  They contract for people to do various things...  What do they contract them to do?  Well...  There are 120 point Research Masters Programmes.  There are 240 point Research Masters Programmes.  There are 360 point PhD Programmes (that are exendible to 480 points).  That is to say, 1 year full time, 2 year full time, 3 year full time, 4 year full time research programmes.

                                <p>They need to be clear about the length of the programme.  When graduation is.  When the thesis is due  by.  If the supervisors job is to help the student.  Help make the work better.  Help fix up typos.  Help make sure the project is right-sized.  Help make sure there are enough references.  Help make sure the references are suitably balanced.  Help the student complete on time.

                                They need to be clear about the cost of tuition.  That's associated with the length of the programme.  They need to be clear about the amount of living costs (and how that is funded) which comes down to the length of the programme, again.
                                </p>

                                <p>A centre for excellence in terrorism..  Offering $15,000 masters degrees.  The cost of tuition is how much?  How much in living costs are associated with the length of the programme?  Is it a 1 year Masters with a $15,000 tuition fee?  So the students need to bring money to live, where..  Live in the supervisors house?  Do their cooking and cleaning?  For how many years?

                                She could have chosen to say 'I accept your invitation to speak at commencement...  But, I need to wear my Univeristy of Waikato Gown for the Communications Degree that I earned from that Institution.  It is important to New Zealand.  And I am a cultural ambassador for New Zealand'.  Instead she chose to sh*t all over New Zealand Tertiary Education.  Is the class of '22 PhD law programme from Harvard supposed to sue her for loss of value to their education?  Did she attend a single course?  Did she hand in a single assignment?  Where is her thesis?  What the hell...
