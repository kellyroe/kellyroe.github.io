 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->

                            <article>

                                <p> My understanding is that the courts did not consider the question of whether the infant needs surgery (what options there may be and what risks may be involved with the different options).  The parents and courts all assumed that there was 'my way or the highway' with respect to what the surgeon / surgical team / hospital staff were saying and the highway involved the likely death in the near future for the infant.  The only optionw was open heart surgery apparently (not a balloon catheter) and the open heart surgery was likely to require blood products.  Nobody questioned those things.  Nobody questioned how or why the baby had a defective valve in the first place. Or whether the baby in fact had a defective valve at all.  That is important with respect to competency of the party that the courts wanted to grant custody to.  For example, if it turns out that they didn't even have a radiology report on the state of the heart and whether that kind of condition rights itself as the kid grows or not...  If they didn't even have secure imaging to show that there was the problem that they say that there is...  If they don't even have accurate records about the child.  If the condition was caused by (for example) giving the mother steroids to induce premature delivery so they could keep it in a Fisher and Paykal incubator in conditions that has a tendancy to result in enlarged heart size and various problems..  Then the competency of the surgical team / hospital staff would be in question.  It would be good to hear some expert witness or testimony from clinically trained people from overseas about best practice in circumstances such as these.  About whether the open heart surgery is the only option, whether blood products are even needed, whether there is reason to believe the kid has stenosis, whether there is reason to believe that operations are needed.  And, of course, a good review of precisely what it is that they are doing to the kid when the kid is institutionalised into their custody.  The decisions they are making on behalf of the parents about various aspects of care that tehy believe they are entitled to make following on from the court order.  Whether they are keeping the parents properly informed of the reasons why they are choosing to do things their way (what other liberties they are taking), I mean to say...  </p>

                                <p>I was a firm believer in vaccinations.  I would have personally chosen to take my vaccinations when they were available to me.  But then I saw how the NZ Government bullied people into complying with Government directive.  How our Government was so quick to grant exemption from liability to the manufacturers of the vaccinations saying that the Government would accept personal liability for harms arising.  Seeing how the Government refuses to pay out the victims of abuses in state care.  That is or means to say the most plalusible reason why it was the Government waived manufacturers liability for harms arising for the people of New Zealand was because they were selling out the health of the New Zealand people.  They waived the manufacturers liabiltiy because of why?  Why?  So they could get cheaper vaccines?  But why not simply allow people who didn't want one to not have one, then, and that way you wouldn't need to have so many of them...  It just doesn't make any sense...  They were hoping that we would get sent the defective ones?  The ones that were more radiclly experimental than everywhere else?  Begging for the ones most likely to result in most harm?  It just doesn't make any sense why the NZ Government was so very very quick to do something that seemed only to be to sell out the health of the people.  </p>

                                <p>If they won't uphold 'no' then there is no power to say 'yes'.  We don't have informed consent in New Zealand.  People are not supplied with information so they can make informed decisions.  The courts weren't supplied with the information that they needed to make an informed decision about what was in the best interests of the child.  They did not hear from diverse experts.  'My way or the highway  because mine is the only expert opinion that will be acknowledged as expert opinion by the Government and the only opinion I am allowed to express if I want to stay on Government payroll as expert' is not enough for anybody to make an informed decision on the basis of that information.  Dissentors aren't allowed in New Zealand.  Anybody who says anything different or critical is duly exterminated.  Not funded.  Disabled incapacitated handicapped bullied to death by the New Zealand Government.  The reason why I did not have a second vaccination is not because I doubt the science behind vaccination.  It is because I doubt the honesty and integrity of the New Zealand Government.  They won't process my applicaiton to enrol in Medicine according to the algorithn that they published for the purposes of accountability.  They are choosing whoever they want for whatever arbitrary reasons they want.  That is the process by which they arbitrarily chose Dr Leeks and various other colleageues..  Ones who did not choose me.  I'm not taking it personally...  But I do find that much of their research is dubious, at best.  Maybe I am wrong about my concerns.  Well, then, they should be big enough and ugly enough to answer my concerns, then.  I am very willing to admit that I was wrong and sometimes I do in fact turn out to be.  But it's just not plausible that in a country of this size with this many people being vaccinated, we haven't had any cases of any harms arising from vaccines.  Other countries, with apparently worse or lower vaccination rates than us, have, however.  So, how can that be?  It just doesn't make any sense.  It defies credibility.  There is no baseline signal coming out of New Zealand.  The honesty and integrity is sorely lacking.   </p>

                                <p>I think there likely are many legitimately serious concerns that we should have about quite a lot of or quite a few of the, particularly major, research projects that various people are up to, within New Zealand.  Many of them are in fact parts of international or world health studies or investigations.  It seems that New Zealand has signed up for or been signed up for being the control group (no treatment) or getting the wrong end of the stick (so to speak) on what treatments are offered (e.g., the ones likely to result in harms, most notably) and that there is no informed consent because individuals have been signed up for experimental conditions or observational conditions that they are required to be kept in for the duration of the experiment, study, or trial.  The health professionals and the governmetn is supposed to stand up for the people of New Zealand, however.  And they won't do it.  I can't tell if that is ignorance or stupidity or maliciousnes or malevolence or hopelessness much of the time.  I don't know...  But this country only appears to be going backwards...  </p>


                                <p>The most plausible reason that I can think of as to why the NZ Government agreed to waive manufacturers liabilty for harm arising is becuase the manufacturers were likely concerned that NZ did not have a health workforce willing and or able to follow the manufacturers instuctions as to how the vaccine was to be transported, stored, and administered.  There were specific and particular instructions provided by the engineers or designers or manufacturers or researchers, you see.  That were based on conditions that they researched.  So, how many doses were to be taken from each vial.  What the expiration dates or hours were for each of the vials or each of the doses reconstituted from the contents of the vials.  Instructions as to how they were to be reconsituted.  The manufacturers liabiltiy extends to what?  To the vaccine being administered and administrated by people with a certian degree or competence and training and so on and so forth.  Teh abiltiy to follow basic instructions.  Instead of 'let's get together and have a yakkity yak yak yak about how we want to do things in our unique socio-cultural environment of New Zealand'.  When more doses were taken from the vials (when we did not have low dead space syringes, even) without our even checking in with the manufacturers first about the possibility.  And so on.  Most of the harms arising were, the manufacturers plausibly thought, ones arising from the local environment.  Ones they couldnt' control..  NOt without sending in an army of Harvard Grads, or similar...</p>

                                <p>So...  This was the kind of information that featured or factored into my decision to say no to second and subseqent vaccination.  Also my recognition that I couldn't say 'no' becuase I couldnt' say 'yes'.  There isn't informed consent in our health system because of the whole bully compliance thing...  The people kept held detained as hostages in our health system.  My recent unlwful detention . NO accurate heath records were kept.  I was given a dose of antibotics in the ED under emergency authorisation from a nurse..  But then no medication charts were available for the remainder of my stay.  So was I allowed to complete the full course of anti-biotics?  Or are they doing everything they can to breed anti-biotic resistent infections in the hospital?  This country makes no sense at all...  I'd think it was incompetence or ignornce.  But the refusal to process my application to Medicine according to the algorithm that was published for the purposes of their accountability makes it considerably more likely that there is genuine maliciousness and ill intent.</p>

                                <p>I wonder if, this weekend, some other kid dies (where the parents were crying out for help from the hospital system) only there wasn't a bed for their kid becuase the hosptial people were too busy being all up in this other kids business. We can't help you becuase there never will be enough to go around. Going out of their way to do everything everything everything for this other kid (bill the government for everything they could get for having him) and getting on on telling the parents that they had control to do anything anything anything they wanted to their kid for the weekend.  Before, you know, handing it back.  The worst of the helecopter science.  Brought to you by New Zealand...  Culture of  bullies in fact.</p>
