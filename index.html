                             <p>
                              <a href="./writing/ks.png">Here is an example of an email from Kim Sterelny (who will not write me a reference).</a> 

                              I collated the 'few small chunks' as he refers to them, here:
                              </p> 

                                <p><a href="./publish/2013-rep.pdf">Roe, (2013).  A few small chunks for 2013.</a>
                                </p>

                                <p>So, one of the perks of being a full time employee of a University is that you can take courses for free.  Without paying.  Who does that?  Seriously...  Who does that?  Do you see Professors enrolled in first year or second year or third year courses?  Of course you don't. 

                                </p>

                                <p>Course are for `the Other'.  There is no way they would volutnarily attend each others courses.  They aren't intellectually or acadmeically curious..  But even if they were..  They wouldn't feel that any of that was satied if they were to attend each others courses.  Would they now?  Why don't they subject themselves to the grading process that is employed by them (or studnets they barely pay) to teach their courses?  How do you think the various academic proefessors would do (what grades would they get) if the 2nd or 3rd or 4th year students were to grade their efforts the way tehy grade their students?</p>

                                <p>

                                 Do you see them doing much in the way of any research, either?  Why would they.  They take all of the money.  THey won't retire once they get to 65.  Why would they retire?  They can tell the kiddies that it's soooo competitive they are required to do anything and everything they say.  Else they won't get their work out for external examination.  They won't write them references.  They can behave as badly as they want and nobody will do anything about it at all.  Who wouldn't want to be Professor.  Right Jacinda?  It's not like you have to spend your time actually squirreled away from the world actually writing a book.  Actually reading and writing.  They'll find you something and cross out the authors name and put yours on it.  Right?  And you can spend all your time flying about the place putting on your party frock being a wing-man for the new Epstein or whatever.  Who wouldn't want to pay and pay and pay to send their kiddies to Harvard so they can party party party with the likes of Jacinda all day?  What University?  How does Jacinda get a Visa to be Professor in the US?  It just doesn't make any sense at all.</p>

                                <p>None of the ANU doctoral candidates had reports from external examiners so far as I could see.  Occasionally people would say that they were told by the ANU that the externals said to accept it without any changes at all.  I don't find it plausible that an external wouldn't find just one more book to be read and referenced.  They couldn't find so much as a single sentence to rearrange.  THere were no oral examinations or publically held oral defences. Were there graduations?  I didn't see any of the doctoral students graduate.  I didn't see any photos of graduation ceremonies.  I didn't see any framed degree certificates  hanging on anybodies wall. The whole thing was just a f*cking hoax -- right?  </p>

                                <p>Of course various people are payrolled in fact.  I suppose Sterelny wrote references for other people.  He just wouldn't write one for me.  I suppose Martin Davies wrote references for other people.  He just wouldn't write one for me.  Good enough to keep re re re re enrolled I was.  They took and they took and they took and they took and they took many many years of writing from me.  Did htey reattribute authorship to others?  I suppose that makes the very best sense of why they are so f*cking  horrible to me now.  Won't acknowledge anything from me at all. F*cking psychopaths.  They weren't hired by any kind of fair process at all.  THey weren't considering applications on their academic merits.  They were throwing the applications away to expedite selection for people who...  Like to party party party with the likes of Epstein, no doubt.  Best do anything anything anything everything everything everything the likes of Sterelny etc etc says.  They can do anything anything anything anything.  F*cking psychopaths.  It's sooooo hostile.  Sooooo competitive.  It' ssoooo f*cking competitive there's actually nothing there, at all.  What University?</p>

                                <p>The University of Waikato doesn't have any research outputs.  Where are all the new theses accepted into their library every year?  All the new books suplied by the researchers employed by the University?  What University?  ffs.  There's nothing there.  Just a f*ckign garbage dump quite by design.  Won't get work out for external examination.</p>

                                <p>All these people on payroll apparently or supposedly with the function of being `academic support staff' to help high quality research be done in a timely fashion.  Who offers to check the work for typographical errors?  Anybody?  What's that?  Their actual function is to prevent and prohibit and bully bully bully.  Waikato told me I needed to get them a hardbound thesis no later than 27 November 2005.  So that's what I did.  I never missed a deadline as an undergrad.  I don't know why they thought I needed to take 2 academic years and 1 summer school to do 1 year's worth of work.  But that's what they advised me to do.  They didn't advise me to apply for doctoral programme and submit for doctoral exam after that amount of time.  That's the quality of their f*cking advise.  Their f*cking supervision.  What supervision?  Here comes D D D D D D D D David Lumsden.  With his extensive research portfolio of..  How many words in 1 year?  FFs.  Why so slow?  Why so f*cking slow?  They pay you by the hour or something?  He did get out once he hit 65.  Didn't need to be prclaimed dead of a heart attack like Alistar Gunn, at least.  With the whole pedophiles in the schools programme.  Party party party out at Alistar's party house anybody???  See why he's head of medical ethics.  Why Waikato wants a medical school.  yeah, right.  There's nothing there.  What University?  Where's your f*cking research output you f*cking idiots?  What University?  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>And of course the ANU isn't any better.  And Harvard just hired Jacinda, alledgedly.  3 fellowships for the book she's going ot have attributed to her.  How did she get a visa to the US?  How is she qualified to be professor?  Where is your research output Jacinda?  For how many years were you working at doctoral level?  What a f*cking joke.</p>

                                <p>There isn't any medicine or any health system or any educaiton system etc etc...  Because nobody actually wants anybody else to live etc.  There's nothing there.  It's just  been taken over by psychopathic bullies and abusers.  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>Go to University to eat lunch with your friends?  To go away on camping trips?  To go skinny dipping with the teenagers expedited quickly quickly domestic adults need not apply.  What Univesrity?  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>What a f*cking joke of a farce of a hoax of a f*cking scummy scummy scam.</p>

                                <p>Of course I know that masses of undergrads are allowed to dress up for graduation and graduate every year.  Mostly only the ones who are staying on being re re re re re enrolled in other qualifications though.  Right?  They aren't graduating people from PhD.  They won't employ anybody with a PhD.  They won't employ anybody who has done the work for one.  Why?  Why do that when you can take the likes of Ashley Bloomfield who, apparently, never applied to do PhD, did not do the work for one.  He has no research output.  Well, then, call him Professor and pay him hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to tell the kiddies that he can do anything anything anything he likes.  The judged reappointed from retirement back onto payroll over the age of 65 won't see anything wrong.  What University?  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>Jacinda apparently read teleprompts to some  graduates of Harvard to tell them they could come to NZ and breed bolt-holes full of knock out gamma babies.  Probably get funding from the NZL governmetn to call it a state care institution.  All the knock out baby gene research to make happy little sex puppets or whatever the f*ck they want.  Right?  Why the hell else do you suppose it's soooooo competitive to get to to medicien.  It's sooooo comeptitive.  Oh my!!! It's sooooo competitive!!  Nobody need actually apply.  That's how f*cking competitive it is.  There's  nothing there.</p>

                                <p>Appraently Sah is a model medical student.  She teaches Les Mills Classes around Auckland, sometimes 2 or 3 classes per day at different gyms.  She's also apparently doing her clinical placements as a medical studnet!  Wow!  She's superman!  I see why they chose her!  She can commute around Auckland like the entire city just revolves around her!  Get herself to gym classes and then out at various hospitals from Middlemore to NorthShore!  Then back to spin!  Is there anything superman can't do!</p>

                                <p>Apparently Amy is a model ED doctor.  She teaches Les Mills classes, too.  Is there anything Amy can't do!  She's so full of beans after an ED shift, one can only suppose, that she's up for teaching spin!  Yeah, right!  Everything revolves around her.  Commmute times etc.  Yeah, f*cking right.</p>

                                <p>That's what it meeeeeeans to study Medicine.  To spend all day up there on the stage.  That's what it meeeeeans.  That's what it meeeeeans to be an ED doc.  Yeah, right.  It's sooooo comeptitive there's nothing there!!! What a f*cking farce of a hoax of a f*cking scummy scam.  They have time to do a little filming for Shortland Street, as well?  Teach the international community how to pass themsleves off as a doctor or nurse or whatever in NZL?  That's tthe education and training progarmme.  Right?  Only one the government would fund.  NZ on air.  Full of f*cking hot air, that's for sure.  THey couldn't find garduates of sport and exercise science progammes..  People actuallky qualified to teach group fitness?  What educaiton and training system?  What a f*cking joke.  If Ashley can't be re-deployed into position without no difference in quality then it can't be done.  Not in NZ.  There's nothign there.  </p>

                                <p>The turnover is not because people are leaving.  It's becuase they won't pay the workers.  It's just a f*cking scam is what it is.  THey won't pay them.  I've had friends trying to work in hospitality in NZL and they get phoned up expected to donate their time in the name of being trialled.  THey turn up and find someone called in sick and they are treating applicants for positions as a roster to cover regulars.  They aren't paying them.  They just say thanks for the trial and they'll let them know.  I guess they do the same for nursing and teaching and medical shifts as well.  Tell people to be on call for no pay.  Just triallling them.  See how they go.  F*cking psychopaths.  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>I don't see any different.  Where's my f*cking payroll? For all the work I f*cking did?  Have to hire various peple from overseas they won't payroll anybody from here.  How did Rachel Brown and Nick Southwood and Holly and Ben and various other people get paid.  Why the hell do they get paid while I'm not?  What did the other ANU students do that I did not?  I did everything Kim sterelny said.  What did  he say?  F*cking not really anything at all.  F*cking psychopath.  Oh he said it's soooo comeptiive and soooo hostile and he's a f*cking psychopath and f*cked the dog, c*nt and you have eto go away on camping trips it's important for your career.  F*cking psychopath.  Is it dead yet?  F*cking hurry up.</p>

                                <p>I mean conference is sooooo worthwhile.  Various people not attending anybody else's talks, too busy hiding away in their hotel room writing their own.  Didn't bother to finish it before booking for conference.  Else the people off sightseeing.  All the tourist activities.  Too busy to attend the conference.  Just a thinly veiled excuse for a holiday.  Then you have the people who only turn up to `in group' friends talks in order to take up all the question time and make sure nobody independent or external can get a question in.  Right Sterelny?  Make sure nobody questions your boys.  You can have a group where everybody goes to everybody else's talks (only) -- no matter how many times they've heard it before.  So they can all throw rocks at anybody not deemed sufficiently 'in'.  F*cking animals.  That's why we sign up for philosophy conference.  Clearly.  To sit with our friends.  Sooo motivating and inspiring!  Don't you want to join them!!!  No?  You don't?  Awwwww.  But they're soooo popular and coool.  Don't you want to do anything anything to have dinner with Sterelny?  Ffs.  What a f*cking farce.</p>

                                <p>When it's time to pay people (to give them a share, to let them have a life, too) then it's time for them to go away.  To be put away.  To be decommissioned.  To be retired.  Extermainated. So all of the over 65's can say they simply have to say on payroll because nobody else could possibly do any of the things that they do.  They exterminated everybody else.  Sterely was the only game in town.   Him and his wife.  How's their daughter doing?  She been quickly quickly quickly expedited into place?  She probably doesn't need a payroll of her own.  She could arrange for him to be detained in a basement or hospital or aged care institution somewhere and simply take her parents salary for herself.  It's more than she's likely to ever get to earn independently.  Right, Sterelny?  Takes the whole tribes resources to raise your child.  Right?</p>

                                <p>So Jacinda's part of the whole terrorist breeding programme.  They want to get people blowing up graduation ceremonies full of graduates.  When it's time to pay them it's time for them to go away.  So the over 65's can keep taking everything they beleive they are entitled to.  Them and only them.  There isn't anybody else.  Nobody else applied.  All the other applications were thrown away.</p>

                                <p>So the way to try and train a bunch of people to want to blow up graduation is to teach them that you don't get to graduate if you've done the work.  Rather, you get to sit at home and watch Jacinda be given honorary degrees, from your tv or your youtube.  See others who didn't do any of the work get given all the honors and awards.  A great pretence.  Tee hee.  Ha ha.  Trying to provoke people to blow up an entire cohort of graduates.  That's ideal.  Right?  Right when it's time for them to have payroll's of their own.  Time for them to be marched off to the death camps. What's that Jacinda...  Try and use social media to bully and exclude and so on.  Identify the vulnerable targets.  Train them to be in the position where everything can be blamed on them, then.  Jacinda's great idea is that we can follow someone so closely (anybody who asks for help or asistance is a natural target -- they have a forced confession, practically, right?) We'll arrangen for them to be tailed so closely..  Do evreything we can to get them to go postal.  A little non-prescription LSD..  Everything everything everything we can to get them to take the blame for exterminating people when it's time for us to pay them.  Alllll the honors and awards for Jacinda!!  So she can adopt an element of cultural dress and have everybody listen to her in rapt attention and awe.  All coming together in face of tragedy to celebrate her!! All heil Jacinda!!</p>

                                <p>So what's the career-plan to get to be a graduate of Harvard, then?  Work hard in school, everybody?  No?  That's not it??  Read the teleprompts.  That's the level of reading.  There was a hesitancy when it came to announcing the new abortion laws for NZL.  That would  be fixed by a lower reading age.  Or maybe a little nasal polyp surgery, or similar.</p>

                                <p>What a f*cking farce of a f*ckign hoax of a f*cking joke of a f*cking scummy scam.  How much work is it for a PhD?  HOw many years of work?  Where's the f*cking work of these people you expedite into position on payroll, then?  Either to never output any research ever again (unlikely they wrote what was even attributed to them) else to steal their studnets work and pass that off as their own.  There's nothing there.  F*cking garbage hoax of a f*cking scummy scam.  There's nothing there.  F*cking psychopaths.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                                <p>The aged care they deserve.  Nobody will remember you in 5 years anyway, right Sterelny?  YOu can't / won't talk about any of 'your work' (yeah right) you did before then.  There's nothing there.  F*cking psychopaths.  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>There is no education and training system.  Sah's a model medical student.  When does she have time to study?  She can't even make the commute times to all her work placements.  It's not plalusible at all.  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>Ashley Bloomfield is Professor, now?  He never applied to do PhD or MD.  He did not do the work for one.  Who wrote him a reference for that job?  Nobody will write me a reference from the ANU.  Right Kim Sterelny?  Where's my reference for all of the work that I did while you were my named supervisor?  F*cking psychopath.  Get the f*ck out.  Is it dead yet?  Please hurry up and f*cking well die so that othe rpeople can f*cking well live, for a f*cking change.  Is it f*ckign well dead yet?  Did it get out it's paper and pen?  Is it ready to start doing the supervision job?  Is Chris Whelan doing his job yet?  Processing the complaints of wrongdoing?  How old is Justice Toogood?  What's the retirement age on Judges?  How old is the Ombudsman?  GET OUT.  F*CKING PSYCHOPTHS.  GET OUT.</p>

                                <p>Do you honestly think that Ashley Bloomfield could write a first year essay that would be passed for population health?  What education and training system?  Prison.  Slave.  Death camps.  They are f*cking death camps.</p>

                                <p>All the people they payroll who don't do the job for which they are paid.  THey won't do it.  That's precisely why they are payrolled.  The job will not be done.  Not by them.  Not by anyone.  Their mission is to seek and destroy anybody with the capacity to do the job in the vicinity.  So they can say they are the only game in town.  There was no alternative.  THey destroy every alternative.  F*cking psychopaths.  There's notihng of any value tehre.</p>

Do you show it to the kiddies so they can be all motivated and inspired about the kinds and sorts of things they can do, too?  All the nasal polyp surgeries.  All the date rape drugs.  All the unauthorised cervical exams.  All the non-consented examinations.  There's nothing there.  F*cking psychopaths.  There's nothing there.</p>
