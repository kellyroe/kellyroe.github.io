 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>The worst thing about the Australian National University (and the Univeristy of Waikato's aspirational ideal to be a second rate imitator) isn't how they treated me, at the time.  Refusing to acknowledge my work.  Refusing to get it to externals so as to prevent and prohibit timely completion of graduate research.  The worst of it is how they choose to treat me now.  Today.</p>

                                <p>They refuse to accept that I have laid a complaint with them.  They just refuse to accept it.  The Australian National University says 'in order for you to lodge a complaint you need to do x and y and z'.  They just make up stuff.  And then, when you do what they tell you to do, they deny that you have done it.  Revise and resubmit your complaint, Ms Roe.  We don't accept your complaint Ms Roe.  Revise and resubmit your complaint Ms Roe.  How many complaints do they receive?  Let me guess, sinc Chris Whelan's job (as CE of the NZVCC) is obviously and clearly to ensure that New Zealand Universities are second rate imitators of Australian Universities and since Chris Whelan refuses to acknowledge that he has received any complaints (when his statutory function is to progress complaints) they probably say they have never ever ever ever ever received a single complaint from a student about the University's refusal to process or misprocessing of research.  </p>

                                <p>The Vice Chancellor of the Australian National University was informed.  He kept telling me that I needed to complain to x or y or z person.  I mean to say the buck stops with him.  It wasn't that he intentionally employed underlings incapable of doing their job and he is ignorant of the complaints they have recieved.  He received my complaint and he chose to blow me off.  </p>

                                <p>What is the problem?  The problem is that they are not properly handling (1) enrolments (2) progressions (3) completions of graduate research (also likely undergraduate) qualifications.  THey will not do their job of supervising grduate research students (helping them get their thesis done in a timely fashion).  They think their job is to stabotage and undermine and so on.  Then they don't get the studnets research out for external examiantion.  They bully the studnet into doing a lot of work in excess of the requirements for the qualification.  I thought it was limited to heavy handed bullying.  But my experience with the Univesrity of Waikato shows everyone the lengths they will go to if you don't do what they are trying to bully you into doing.  I meant to say, they went to far as to deny that I had shipped them a thesis I have track and trace signed delivery evidence of them having received, and to refuse to get the theis they had been shipped out for external examiantion.  To this day, they never sent the thesis of 14 September 2018 out to external examiners for it to be externally examined so as to prevent any possibility of the examiners signing that it was to be accepted which would have meant I would have completed the 120 point qualification without re-enrolment being required.</p>

                                <p>During the relatively early years of lockdown (Maybe it was 2019 or 2020) the students in England (who were preparing to sit their Cambridge Exams) were told that they likely wouldn't get to sit the exams. The studnets were distraught.  Their selection into University was dependent on their examination performance, they had been led to believe.  That was why they were paying however much money they were paying to sit the examinations.  That was why some of them were workign so hard on learning curriculum contents.  Oh, don't worry, the University people said.  We already know who is going to be sent offers and that is quite indepndent from examination scores.  We don't need the examination scores to know which students we prefer.  It doesn't upset anything at all that the kids can't sit their Cambridge Exams this year.  In fact, we can simply allocate high Cambridge Exam scores to the people we have already selected for this and that University, and lower ones to the people we have selected for this other University, and you don't need to sit your exams at all!</p>

                                <p>Who wants to pay money to sit Cambridge Exams?  Now, that appears to be a system with integrity.  In upside down and back to front land.  Wouldn't you say? </p>

                                <p>So you can understand that when the University of Auckland and Otago say you haven't been selected to Medicine because you rank order score was not high enough..  What they mean to say was that they did not choose you therefore they bumped you down the rank order score.  Or, if they couldn't bump you down the rank order score enough (because they don't have enoguh control over the rank order scores with their control over the interview which apparently gives them the power of 'definite no' or 'definite yes' according to Peter Crampton and friends in print) then they can simply throw away your application and say you were declared 'ineligible' (that's what in fact Peter Crampton and friends were doing with them).  Else they can simply refuse to supply you with an application.  Get Andrea Howard to refuse to supply one.  Tell the IT people to lock certain candidates out of being able to submit an application to ensure that they do not get selected.  I can't see why they would need to remove applications if they were not...  Afraid?  That the applicant was a genuine contender.  That doesn't really make any sense now, does it?</p>

                                <p>The University of Auckland told me I was not accepted to study Medicine in 2019 because my rank order score was not high enough for me to be selected.  That is what they chose to tell me.  With a little note that they suggest I get support for my mental health since it must be very upsetting to me to learn I wasnt' academically strong enough.  When I asked them to check their math because I believe they made a mistake they supplied information to me as to how they had calculated my GPA.  I informed them that the way they calculated it was different from how they had published that they were going to calcualate GPA's.  In particular, they had used 'worst 120 points of study' in a year when they promised to use the 'best 120 points of study' if you did more than 120 points in a year (including summer school papers above stage one) and they used a part time year instead of the most recent full time year.  I mean to say, if you record that a 120 point Masters thesis took 2 academic years and 1 summer school period of enrolment, then you have in fact forced the student into less than 120 points credit over the first year in order for there to be any points remaining to distribute over the summer school and second academic year enrolment period.  They eventually agreed that they way tehy calculated it was not in accordance with their algorithm.  I supplied them with a calculation that was in accordance with their algorithm and they said that it didn't matter because they declared me 'ineligible to have applied'</p>

                                <p>I mean to say that the University of Auckland is not making decisions about who to enrol (and who not to enrol) in MBChB on academic grounds, at all.  They are not at all being fair.  They are refusing to calculte GPA's in accordance with their published algorithm at all.  They are not even trying to be fair.  What is worse is that they refused to sort this out in house.  They had plenty of time and opportunity to correct their wrong and offer me enrolment.  But they refused to do that, instead sending offers to other candidates.  They then refused to do things properly again in 2020 and decided to spend a bunch of money hiring a law firm to defend their inability or unwillingness to follow their published selection criterion for the purposes of their accountability with the courts after their in house counsel missed a filing deadline and I requested judgment proceed in their absence.  The courts chose to grant them extensions so they could get an external firm to do their filings properly.  So far the courts have delivered the judgment that the University of Auckland can do whatever it wants with complete and utter immunity.  They aren't responsble for anything or accountable for anything.  Justice Fitzgerald found that Auckland does not have the power to deem applicants 'ineligible' since the Statute says that domestic adults are 'eligible'.  But she provided no consequences for them having deemed me 'ineligible' when tehy did not have authority to do that.  And she failed to order them to calculate my GPA in accordance with the algorithm and enrol me in teh progamme (or not) on the basis of my correctly calculted rank order score.  She refused to award costs against them and some kind of damages to me for the University's blatant refusal to do it's f*cking job.</p>

                                <p>I guess this is so we understand the lengths that the Universities and Courts go to to ensure that Dr Leeks and the like will be the only game in town in New Zealand hospitals.  Before Harlene Hays set off on her mission to go ruin the University of Western Australia now, she refused to graduate more than 1/3rd the Medical Class.  Right?  Said that she did not accept the evidence that they supplied of being signed off as having completed their internships.  She simply refused dto accept tht.  The students were told that the Junior Doctor positons they were supposed to be taking up at the DHB's up and down NZ the following year were still there for them.  But they were going to be kept enrolled in the University and they were going to be kept paying fees to the University for continued re-enrolment and they were going to be passing themselves off as Junior Doctors in the hospitals but the University was going to refuse to acknowledge that they had completed the MBChB.  Welcome to the slave camp detention facility refusal to have an education and training programme land.  What's supposed to happen?  Well, there are various people (Justice Toogood, say) who has had lucrative governmetn payroll for 40++ years who think that the next generation or two should simply be marched off to death camps or serve as slaves or whatever so that he can never retire.  All of the money for them to refuse to train a new generation.  All of the money for htem to refuse to do any of the things that is in tehir actual job description.  What research outputs?  Where are all the theses?</p>

                                <p>The University of Waikato acknowledges that I compeleted a MA thesis with them.  Where is it?  It is not in the department repository.  My former supervisor sent it to me saying he thought I shuold have it.  Why?  I wrote it.  It was supposed to be lodged in the department thesis repository for the information of future students.  The University of Waikato is refusing to acknowledge research that is being done within teh University.  The people on payroll to research output..  What?  5,000 words of research every 2 years?  Every 5 years?  I understand, now, that academia itself takes research from some slaves and reattributes authorship of that research to other people.  You wouldn't expect the likes of Princeton to traffick in stealing research from Australaia, say, and passing it off as their own students work or ever the work of their Professors, right?  But that appears to be how low they go with the hiring decisions they choose to make.  Who wants to teach?  You can take your students work and pass it off as your own.  Then fail the students out so they won't find out what you have done.  Tell them they are too garbage.  Who wants to be an editor of a journal?  Take the submissions and reattribute them once the studnets have been bullied into fleeing the Univesrity with no credit.  It's just a scummy scummy scam is what it is.  It wouldnt' matter quite so much if you didin't need a degree to do something like law or medicine or engineering.  Oh, what's that?  They will never pay you to do any of those things if you have qualifications in the field.  Silly silly girl.  Didn't you know our hospitals, particularly, are 'staffed' by people who pay teh governmetn anything anything anything to play doctors and nurses for 10 days or whatever it is.  The likes of Dr Leeks.  The Glue Factory they have going on down in Dunedin.  The reason they won't process my application because I would stand up to the likes of Professor Glue.  Dr Leeks 2.0.</p>

                                <p>Dr Leeks!  All heil.  When will the monument in his honor be built? The monument so that he can reflect on how he had such an impactful life.  His victims will never forget.  Right?  That's the goal the purpose the aim the point.  Many of the kids he were sent had clear and obvious capacity and potential.  That's the truth of it.  And his job was to take them out.  Eliminte them.  So that certain other people's children were the only game in town.  The only candidate.  Because it's soooooo competitive.  The aim of Medicine being to kill and maim and harm and destroy.  Of course.  Clearly.  It's soooo cmoeptitive how could things be any other way?  The courts can get off their arses to order child uplifts before the evidnce is even in.  Before expert testimony for the other side can be heard (for a change).  In New Zealand 'Medical expert testimony' only ever means 'my way or the highway' by peple who were most emphaticlly NOT selected in virtue of their place on a rank order score list.  Corruption.  It's like they've had their eyes gouged out.</p>
