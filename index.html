                                There is a link to my CV that I have presently under consideration for various things.

                             <p>I will try not to do  anything to break the links.</p>

                             <p>I am file re-formatting my work.  Into tables and columns.  And also organising it into yearly increments.  E.g., </p>

                              I collated the 'few small chunks' as he refers to them, here:

                              <p>I'd suggest sending the military in *with* the international inspectors.  The international inspectors of how many people are being unlawfully detained in rooms off the side of the ED or various other places around the hospital. You know, for maximum billings for the hospital.  Keeping as many hostages as they can.  how many people held in seclusion rooms without paperwork having been filled out.  How many people have been given psychoactive substances by people on health system payroll -- without them having kept proper records of what they have given them.  How many unauthorised and non-consented procedures and so on have been performed.  Maybe open the supply cupboards and see what's going on there.  Why there aren't medical suppplies.  I guess they know where the supplies go becuase it wouldn't be that hard to microchip them.  That's how they figured out where the HIV medications were been diverted and where they were diverted to etc.  Right?  And so on.  Immunisations.  Where they ended up.  When.  And why.</p>

                              <p>How many SMO's were they?  No...  How many are there, really?  Is Amy Liu a SMO?  Moonlighting as a spin instructor?  I don't know where she finds the energy.  How she can make the commute times.  Maybe she cycles to spin.  That must be it.  Flies.  Or something.</p>

                              <p>The security situation will likely turn into an arms race.  Of the literal variety.  Is that the plan?  The government employees will win becuase they government employees are the ones with the biggest guns?  Please send the UN inspectors in, first, to see whether arming the hospital is in the public's interests, or not.  How do you tell when a hospital has been taken over by militants?  The staff I mean.  The `staff',</p>

                              <p>Would you describe Dr Leeks as a `militant leader'?  Would you?  How about Dr Green?  How about Harry Harlow?  (Check him out on Wiki).  Most revered leaders for everything it is that we value.  Sorry.  You lose.  Consider all the procedures and so on that are performed on non-consenting involuntary patients every year.  For whatever reason.  Oops. Or because they got a court order.  Custody for the day to do a little anything anything to someone else's kid -- before giving it back.  Because they don't have enough people wanting help with various things.  They are too busy helping themselves to various people.  What health system?  Can't even / won't even process graduations.  Won't allow external examinations.  Won't process applications to enrol.  There's nothing there.  Been taken over  by militants.  What does it *mean* to have been taken over by militants?  What?  Are we waiting for them to wear hajib, or something?  That's the only way we know who the militant terrorist's are -- wouldn't you say?  No other indicators...  All the people being kept in seclusion isolations being unlawfully drugged around the hospital.  What hospital?  What university?  Can't even won't even process graduations or applications to enrol. </p>
