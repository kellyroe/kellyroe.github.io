 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->

                            <article>

                                <p>The Tertiary Education Commission defines a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  
                            <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a>.  The writing tab shows that the University acknowledged having received my application to enrol in a 120 point MPhil with 05 March 2018 start date by their prescribed deadline.  The TEC approved the qualification as being 'right sized'.  They have the statutory function of approving qualifications and checking that the enrolment period (34 weeks) matches the FTE EFTS (1) also the points value (120).  But the University of Waikato is keeping records showing that they are not billing students in this manner, at all.  They have had every opportunity to correct their records and they refuse.  They instructed me to take them to court if I had a problem with their practices.  The courts have, thus far, refused to uphold justice.  International and domestic community need to be warned that they are lacking in honesty and integrity.  They are interested in closing ranks around their wrongs.  New Zealand isn't lacking skilled workforce or labor, at all.  New Zealand is a nasty little despot where the people with power refuse to allow other people to function.  Hostages.
                            </p>

                            <p>The University of Waikato believes they are entitled to require studnets to work for at least 12 months on their 120 point 1 EFT thesis before undergoing an external examination period of up to 3 months.  Since you are required to be enrolled at the end of the external examination period that means that if the examination period takes 3 months then you are required to be enrolled in and pay fees for an enrolment period of 12 months plus 3 months for a total of 15 months.  They took more than 3 months to examine my MA.  I think they only did examine it because I had already left the country.  But it doesn't stop there.  They believe that if the external examiners say anything about changes needing to be made to the substance (e.g., a reference to be added, a section to be moved around) then they are entitled to require the studnet to re-enrol for an additional 6 months and also undergo another external examination period of up to 3 months.  That means another 9 months added.  Basically forcing the student to repeat the f*cking year.  They say that the outcome of what they like to call 'first examination' is always that the student is required to pay fees for another 9 months.  This is fairly inevitable.  That is to say, they offer the 120 point qualification with the expectation that students will end up working for at least 12 months plus 3 months plus 6 months plus 3 months for a total of 24 months (2 years).  What happens then depends a  bit on the university.  Waikato has this 'option' for the university administration whereby the studnet takes another 2 1/2 months to make minor changes.  Find another reference.  Move a comma.  Etc.  The University administration believe they have discretion to force this -- else they can say the student failed to meet their requirements and the qualification is withheld.  
                            </p>

                            <p>Here is how much the Inland Revenue now says I owe the New Zealand Government for my 'Education' and 'Training' that are not acknowledged because New Zealand qualifications apparently expire 5 years post-graduation (well, not the Judges law degrees, apparently, but my qualifications have expired): 
                            <a href="judicial-review/ird-shot.pdf" target="_self"> $104,663.</a>  You can see, then, that New Zealand does not appear to have functioning Universities, they appear to have detention or forced labor camps.  They won't progress or process academic work (particularly research).  They refuse to get official documents (theses submitted for examination) to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit external examiners signing off on qualification completions.  There is no skilled labor workforce, in New Zealand, because New Zealand has a series or system of forced labor detention camps only.  You pay the University you pay the University you pay the University you pay the University.  Maybe they put you to work as an actor playing the part of a skilled professional.  Then, when you are done paying them, your qualifications are withheld.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            It is not plausible that people fake their way into University laboratories and lectures without being provided with University Identification Cards and Student Identification Numbers.  It is not plausible that people fake their way into hospitals and operating theatres and clinical treatment rooms without being provided with District Health Board Identification Cards and so on.  It is not plausible that people get employment positions without being provided with references by people in the field.  There is clear evidence, on the other hand, of the Universities refusing to progress students work and refusing to confer qualifiations of studnets who have done the work that was required for qualification completion.  The Universities think that they can decide who they give and withhold qualifications from on arbitrary grounds.  They seem to want a army of people to do what they are told.  Then look at what they are told to do.  Doctors, lawyers, engineers, nobody can function in New Zealand.  A system of slave or detention camps.  The prevention and prohibition of social development, the prevention and prohibition of education, the prevention and prohibition of justice.

                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  They aren't progressing the filings. They are refusing to supply applications, refusing to process applications on their academic merits.  Apparently it isn't a matter of public interest how they pick and choose people to pass themsleves off as 'doctors' in our hospitals.
                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  Demanding me to pay more and more and more money to the courts else they force all my cases aborted, or abandoned.  <a href="judicial-review/sc-eyes.pdf" target="_self"> Here is the Judgement of the Supreme Court that I am attempting to appeal on the grounds that it is manifestly grotesquely unjust. </a>  It is like they have their eyes poked out.  Our highest court does not seem to have the conception of justice, at all.  It was the courts decision to delay Roe v University of Waikato proceedings until AFTER Roe v NZVCC and also until AFTER Roe v University of Auckland.  The Judge for Roe v NZVCC made all kinds of pronouncement in his judgment on the matter of Roe v University of Waikato.  That is to say instead of judging the issue he was supposed to be judging (the inaction of Chris Whelan in his capacity as CE of the NZVCC) he thought he would weigh in on whether or not I had done enough for completion of the MPhil Degree.  Clearly that is a matter of the Judge of a different case to decide!  
                            </p> 

                            <p>
                             <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  The Australian Constitution clearly names New Zealand as a state of Australia.  They say that they don't have to honor the constitution because New Zealand officials did not turn up to various things and they did not consent.  I don't know why Australia would care about consent in that instance.  Did they care about the consent of the Aboriginal people of Australia?  Did they care about consent of people to be immunised or subject to medical treatments or experimentation?  If they want to change the constitution then there is a process for it to be changed.  I think it involves a vote.  But New Zealanders don't get to vote so the Australian Government clearly does not care whether or not the people of New Zealand consent.  New Zealand functions as a detention camp of Australia.  But then, Australia still seems to govern like it is a detention camp of the Northern Hemisphere, so...
                            </p>

                            <p>Here are  <a href="judicial-review/sup-court-waikato.pdf" target="_self"> My Filings </a>to the Supreme Court regarding the University of Waikato    
                            </p>

                            <p>Una Jagose doesn't seem to have the job of instructing Crown Law to prosecute corruption within New Zealand Universities, or within the Judiciary (where judges refuse to accept evidence and where the supreme court punishes people for bringing injustices before the courts).  I suppose that is why they pay her more than half a million dollars to do that job.  They pay her to ensure the job is not done by anyone.  Not by her and not by anybody else.  The fact she is in the job prevents and prohibits the job being filled  by anyone with the willingness and ability to do the job.  It seems there is no evidence that they will accept that would attest to corruption.  None of the invoicing information that I provided (e.g., 0.5 EFTS = 120 points = 60 points = indefinate enrolment).  New Zealand does not appear to have a functioning judiciary.    <p> <a href="judicial-review/crown-law.pdf" target="_self"> Blow off response. </a>  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            <a href="judicial-review/adhbinterlocutory.pdf" target="_self"> My request for permission from the High Court to appeal their decision to award costs against me with respect to the ADHB having chosen to file motion to have my proceedings struck out rather than the ADHB having chosen to stop with involuntarily detaining people in conditions likey amounting to torture. </a>  That sounds confusing.  It all starts to sound confusing, doesn't it.  The gaslighting garbage output nonsense nonsene nonsense from the courts.  Denying the evidence.  Refusing to acknowledge the half of the laws that speak to the duties and responsiblities and actual job descriptions of the various government departments (e.g, the NZVCC and various of the Universities).

                            The lengths the government goes to to ensure that the people of New Zealand live as short nasty and bruitish little lives as the government can get away with.  Bickering and squabbling and sqawking and in-fighting and moaning and complaining and the complete lack of meaningful work.  There is nothing here.  New Zealand is renowned for the 'tall poppy syndrome' whereby anything of merit is culled.  The costly fitness trap.  That's what Sterelny wanted the world to be.  There isn't any difference between 'ought' and 'is'.  Science and philosophy.  No meaning no knowledge no truth no justice no health no education nothing.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  Why would I help you?  You just take everything you could possibly ever want from me and everybody else, too.  Why oh why oh why would anybody anybody anybody at all help you?  I mean, generally.  Homo sapiens. It is indeed quite the question or problem.  Everything has been hijacked into the service of the problem.  Why would anybody help anybody at all?  How could there possibly be things like health and justice and education.  Answer:  Why, there isn't.  There isn't anything.  Just a bunch of hostages.  Slaves, really.  Living their nasty bruitish and short little lives.  Slaving slaving slaving then it's time for them to die.  Nobody would help anybody at all.  Nobody would teach anybody or  help anybody.  Nobody would  help the sick or the weak or the disabled.  The vultures would swarm in and take every advantage they could.  That's the world that they made.  There isn't any medicine or health or education or anything.  It's all soooooooooo competitive.  Theres  nothing to see.  Nothing at all.  No science. No technology.  No innnovation.  No ethics (take what you can for as long as you get away with it only).  No partnership or group work (only working to undermine and stabotage).  The rowdy sqawk that is this part of the world.  There really isn't anything here.  Just sit around singing the praises of the Minsisters of Everything while they busy themselves with their nasty little despot.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            They don't actually want the people to live, you see.  You can't make sense of healthcare or a health system or whatever when the main aim or goal or purpose or point is to incapacitate and eliminate.  Apparently New Zealand Government managed to source euthanasia 'medication' from somewhere.  We know how well they train their workforce to respect the informed consent of their patients.  We know the inegrity of various things from listing 'melamine' as an ingredient on milk powder (for infant formula) and so on.  Nobody was held to account for the kinds of war crimes that happened around the time of WWII, in New Zealand.  Because the Government of New Zealand never stopped.  Never thought that there was anything at all wrong with any of the things that happened.  With herding the people up and eliminating them.  The Maaori who are left, in New Zealand, look fairly white compared to the indigenous people of other countries.  If you look at some older paintings and even earlier photographs you see much darker Maaori.  There is a distinctive look that you don't see much in people anymore.  I guess because they are either kept locked up and away else they have been genocided already.  We have this thing that I like to call 'esporanto Maaori' that is Maaori -- as brought to you by the New Zealand Government.  It is what happens when the New Zealand Government say that certain native Maaori speakers don't have the ability or capacity to understand or communicate in or teach Maaori to anybody.  Rather, the New Zealand Government choose what sorts of kinds of phrases or expressions count as Maaori and try and take control of the language in that way.  Maaori should never have been written down phonetically.  It is clear from the language (what remains) that it should have been iconographic.  I don't know enough about languages like Chinese or Egyptian to know how those languages work.  But clearly there would have been icons for rivers and mountains and so on.  
                             </p>

                             <p>
                            In some sense, it wouldn't be so bad if the New Zealand Government actually provided things to it's people.  I mean to say, sometimes it is hard or difficult to know what to do about a group of people or whatever when interests etc conflict.  But what is happening in New Zealand isn't anything about that.  I mean, it isn't like the Government needs to imprison or institutionalise..   How many people in New Zealand?  For what length of time?  For why?  I mean..  What do the people of New Zealand get for the imprisonment etc?  As a society.  I mean...  I don't understand what they get for it.  Do they get money for people coming here and treating this place like their own Westworld (to wrongful deathbring and rape and so on)?  Is that the idea?  The New Zealadn Government doesn't seem to want to do anything it is supposed to do...  Squabbling and bickering inhouse.  It is like the tower of babel - except there never was coordinated productive effort towards anything so far as I can see.  I don't see any academic journals or conferences or...  Apparently they undermine the arts because they value the sciences.  But take a look at how they value the sciences.  Take a look at the ouputs over there.  They seem more interested in undermining and stabotaging the sciences than anything else.  Undermining and stabotaging everything.  Party party party.  Right?  That seems to be the idea/l.  Just party party party party party.  Have a party.  Having fun in your nasty bruitish and short little lives?  Party party.  Why would anybody help you?  Right.  That's right.  They wouldn't.  Don't get sick.  Yeah.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Apparently we are forced into the 'information age' or something.  New Zealand Government doesn't have control over any of the information at all.  Doesn't make information based decisions.  Isn't interested in making information based decisions.  Doesn't want to utilise rationality or maths or reasoning or anything anything anything at all in the service of truth seeking in the service of development or fairness or anything like that.  Just interested in hijacking those things.  Partially applying them (misapplying them) for deviant ends or agenda.  Only do the half of the statistical tests that support your view.  Just made up bullsh*t.  Waste your life engaging.  Nobody would engage.  Not voluntarily.  Walk away, then.  Time to die.  If you aren't working for the prevention and prohibition of developmetn programme trying to keep life expectancy as low as possible then what are you doing?  It's sooooooooo competitive.  They need to withhold the Medical qualifications from the people who aren't quite so very effective in wrongful deathbringing to the masses.  That's the real point or purpose of the prevention of health services.  Right?  And education is all about the prevention and prohibition of reading and writing and arithmetic.  How is it possible that there are any people at all?  Oh yeah, there aren't.  There aren't any people at all.  It was all soooooooooooo competitive.  The race to destroy everything as quickly as possible.  The most efficient final solution of all.  We aren't there yet.  Because we are still here.  Don't worry, the people in this part of the world are all working really really hard (collecting up all the money and all the qualifications) for being the very very very very best at being the very very very very worst.  Upside down and back to front land.  Where we can't even (will not, won't do it) perform any of the statutory functions.  Resolutely determined not to be rule by law at all.  It's the customary way in this part of the world, apparently.  No means yes and up means down and stay means go and yes means no and certain people do anything anything anything everything they can get away with for just as long as they can get away with it.  And that's life.  The meaning of life, right there.  You can do anything anything anything you want.  There is nothing here.  Everything.  All of the things for you.  Just take them.  Anythign you can't take there isnt' anything of any of that.  There isn't anything you can't have.  That's efficiency right there.  See?  No reason or point or purpose for anything anything anything at all.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            How long could it possibly take to confer a 120 point 1 year qualification when the requirements have been met?  How hard is it supposed to be to get a 120 point 1 EFT research masters degree?  I am starting to think that we know that people are frauds and hoaxes if they claim to have graduated from 'high value' degrees.  Because nobody graduates from 'high value degrees'.  The qualifications were all withheld.  Apparently 'because of Covid' the Medical Students from Brown were given 2 options:  (1) instead of completing their workplace internship requirement and graduating on schedule with their cohort they could graduate early (without having met the requirements for the Degree).  Else (2) they could delay graduation indefinately.  Those are the options, generally, the world over.  Right?  There isn't anything there.  Good to know.  So hopefully I save other people from having their time wasted.  Don't bother even trying to do the work for anything anything anything at all.  No point.  It's soooooooooo competitive, you see.  You need to spend your time figuring how to stab people in the back and cut them off at the knees.  That's what it is that we most value.  Clearly.  Hence the melamine in the infant formula.  Hey, what doesn't kill them makes them stronger -- right?  More meat on 'em later.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            How long can it possibly take for the courts to uphold justice?  How long can it possibly take for judges to be fairly appointed. I guess they need to carefully select only for whoever is most rapey at law camp etc.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            What makes the best sense?  That's the issue.  What makes the very very best sense of the University's refusal to follow their own regulations.  Apparently they are teaching me a little lesson in what it is that they value or something.  This is the world that they made.  This is how they want things to be.  It's what they are working for.  Look at the outputs of the University.  Look at the journals.  Look at the graduates.  Look at the curriculum, even.  Look at how they take the literature out to be replaced with espanto Maaori and so on.  Esparanto English and Philosophy etc.  Take a look at how you aren't allowed to teach the classics or originals.  Take a look at how you aren't allowed to assume that the University students are literate.  Take a look at how they aren't allowed to be literate.  Take a look at how they won't give them Degrees if they are literate.  Take a look at how they aren't Universities at all.  Where are the journals?  What is the quality of the debate?  What is the quality of the things that get government funding?  The problem isn't that there aren't any people with the ability to do things.  The problem is that those who grubby grub grubbed their way to the top of some local hierarchy keep everybody around them down in a local fitness trap.  That's the idea/l -- right Sterelny?  The plan to ensure that Australasia doesn't have any science or arts or anything anything anything at all.  Nothing to see here, people.  Nothing of any meaning or value.  For how little they were willing to sell out the health and education and welfare and so on of their people.  Nasty bruitish and short.

                            Medicine isn't that hard.  There isn't much maths in it.  The issue is the volume of information.  It is learning a language of terms.  It is having the time to process the information and come to an understanding.  Of course they don't want people to come to an understanding.  They aren't interested in informed consent.  They don't want people to understand and choose.  They want people to comply.  They want Medical Doctors who will not order tests when the Government thinks it cheaper or something to refuse to treat people, effectively.  They don't want to prevent people from dying.  They want to hasten their demise.  Often.  They want to send people to mix vaccines with expired anasthetic solution.  The only people they will sign off on -- right?  They write those people glowing references.

                            Power and control.  And I guess the thing is that you have these leaders who have suffered deprivation in their life so they have pathology that is unresolved that they choose to express.  That's what we are supposed to think.  So that lends credibility to the whole inter-generatationally conferred legitimacy thing.  It's all mafia mob boss it's in the family.  So the lacking in merit thing is the way to go.  Chris Hipkins needs to be minister of all the things because of who his father was, or similar.  So there isn't any work for anybody else -- unless it is to be part of his subordinate army.  Riiiiiiight.  The prevention and prohibition of development programme.  I guess that's how the US military gets a base on NZ soil (rocket lab).  It's not a NZ company at all.  New Zealanders aren't allowed to do physics any more than they are allowed to do epidemiology.  Nothing to see here, people.  Nobody home.  The great extinction programme or plan.

                            <p>The response to things -- The Cartwright inquiry, Marc Hauser being held to account for how he ran his research lab -- has been that a few individuals have been unfairly singled out.  The response has  been that it was unlucky or unfortunate for those few individuals who were singled out.  The response has been that they were not doing anything that many many other people are not doing.  They were not even the worst of the offenders.  It was unfortunate that an example be made of them.  And what was the example that was made of them?  THe example that was supposedly made of them is that it is pointless or fruitless to complain or raise issues about these kinds or sorts of things.  The practices are still widespread and ongoing and the practices are the norm.  The reality and also the norm.  It must always be costly to punish (we must always persecute people who speak out) in order to uphold the norms and what it is that we most value.  The prevention and prohibition of quality research and humane working conditions and the prevention and prohibition of informed consent in healthcare.  The response to these things is that that is precisely why people want to (and why people are promoted in) research and medicine and the like.  I guess the idea is that the only reason they were prosecuted or held to account was because...  It was time to pay them, I suppose.  I would suppose that would have been it.
