    <p>https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2022/11/expert-explains-why-sick-baby-can-t-just-be-given-blood-from-unvaccinated-people.html  It is good Professor Turner got to talk through some of her fears.  Let's see...  One person can't have x because if one person had it then 100 other people would have to have it and then 200 people would have to have it and then everybody would have to have it because we must all be forced to be all the same and not everybody can have it therefore one person can't have it.  Nobody can have it.  
    </p>

    <p>They do autologous (self) transfusion blood doping for sports (e.g., cycling).  Probably you can't with infants because you can only take so much at a time and there wouldn't be enough time to collect enough before the surgery.  And units don't last very long even when frozen.  Something something about iron toxicity in the context of old blood units where the cells burst or lyse...  Not sure about the surgery...  Stenosis was narrowing but the baby's heart and valves should still be growing...  I thought they don't get too upset about murmers in children (unless they are seeming oxygen deprived in the periphery) because the valves are still growing and they often sort themselves out over time..  Maybe there is scaring and scars won't grow.  ?  In which case things will only get worse as the unscarred parts do grow...  I thought they didn't like to replace valves in children because the replacements won't grow so they will need to be replaced again as the child grows...  I don't know... I wonder what went wrong.  If it was auto-immune...  If the surgery needs to happen or if it's just a...  Convenient test case for the courts.  To make some kind of a point, or something...  I don't know...</p>

    <p>I don't know much about blood transfusions / donations in NZ.  I know that they turn away quite a few people.  Saying that a person can't donate because they are a man who has had sex with a man and things like that.  I don't really understand why they won't let people donate on the grounds that they are apparently higher risk of having blood that might be infected with something.  I mean, they test the blood.  Right?  And it's unprotected sex that puts people at risk of HIV rather than who it is they had sex with.  I thought that was what the science was saying.  That condoms prevented HIV transmission.  It seemed more to do with politics and moral disgust at homosexuality than science.  Like the idea that anybody protesting outside the courthouse would have unclean blood.  Most people who got HIV in developed western nations got it from...  Blood transfusions.  But apparently they screen the blood now so that doesn't unintentionally happen anymore.  Unintentional.  It was.  Apparently.  Maybe the pool the blood before they batch screen or test it.  So they try and reduce the risk before pooling it and batch testing since they would have to throw away the whole batch if the batch tested positive (or pool it with a larger vat so the test didn't detect it anymore).  I think NZ blood is processed in Melbourne.</p>


    <p>I don't know the reasons why the parents want to be more particular about the blood.  If it is based on misunderstanding of science, or what.  Science tells us fairly unequivocally that autologous (self) donation is best.  But it is not so easy to roll it out to the masses.  The prohibitions are political, in other words.  And most people in the US don't have their own personal repository of organs (or a clone someplace else to be harvested in an emergency) or freezer full of their own blood (unless they are blood doping for sports) or storage facilities for people to freeze things like umbilical cord blood or eggs or whatever for their own personal use down the track (perhaps, as a form of insurance)...  And we have to follow however many years  behind...  And Australia stopped sending blood overseas for processing (to the US) but NZ has to follow however many years behind...  They will ship back whatever blood products are deemed by them to be suitable for our unique socio-cultural slave-colony environment, one can only suppose. It is pretty crap that when people feel very strongly about an issue..  The health system doesn't even try and be accommodating.  It's always this snap quick judgment (and once made done done cannot be undone) that it can't happen.  It won't happen.  They are committed to it not happening.  And that's an end to it.  Remembering the stuff around vaccination.  To start with people who wanted a vaccination couldn't have one because they were too busy trying to force people who didn't want one to have one.  THe problem was that everybody wanted one therefore not everyone therefore noone could have one.  NO, that wasn't the problem.  The problem was that everybody had to have one because otherwise nobody would have one.  No..  That's not the problem.  The problem is small minds can only comprehend that what one does everybody must do.  Everybody must be entirely the same expendible replaceable units.  You can't do x because if you got to do x then everybody would have to be forced to do x and that's not sustainable.  Therefore no to you.  My way or the highway.  No, my way or the Government will force the Governments will upon the people, anyway.  Look at the fruits of their labors.  Most under-valued people in the world.  Kept by them.  By design.   </p>  

    <p>They ask for family donors for some people to have organ transplants.  In New Zealand.  I remember hearing about one lady who had 3 kidney transplants.  I remember thinking it was strange since some people never get a kidney transplant.  Maybe she had a 'lucky' type so it was easy for them to take a kidney from someone who they found...  I don't think the courts delivered much in the way of sanction to disincentivise them taking organs against the wishes of the family...  There was one case of that...  Where he said 'no, I don't want you to take the organs' and they took them anyway.  The courts established that... The third donated one was from her brother.  Donated specifically for or to her.  Not part of a central system where people are matched according to need or whatever.  Given to her.  I don't know if the public health system does organ transplants or if they are done in the private hospitals now.  I guess the private hospitals use the blood.  But they aren't taking blood from most people so...  Who knows.  Who knows how everything fails to function.  I don't know why her brother didn't donate the first one...  But she eventually rejected the first two and her brother donated the third one in the hope that she wouldn't reject it so quickly.  They allowed her brother to donate her a kidney.  But I guess all our blood gets shipped to Australia and they decide what blood (if any) is appropriate for our unique socio-cultural environment and we take what we are given (lucky to get anything at all).  Take it or leave it.  Or, do what the government says when they say because they say or they will take your baby away.  Do something to it (to try and make it less acceptable to the Mother down the line) and so on...  The reasons they have about the cleanliness of blood are strange...  Not scientific I mean to say.  Politics etc.  Saying that men who have had sex with men cannot donate blood.  Instead of saying that it was about unprotected sex, for example.  It isn't science.  It is politics. </p> 

    <p>I guess Shane Reti or Ashley Bloomfield or Ayesha or the Hamilton West guy can put their MBChB's to good use and weigh in on the Medical I mean political reasons why everybody must be forced to...  Only treat the involuntary.  Only 'treat'...  I'm surprised they haven't imprisoned the parents in the name of psychiatry and given the baby the blood and operation already...  I guess the answer to that lies in all the money all the money all the money all the money all the money for the courts...</p>
