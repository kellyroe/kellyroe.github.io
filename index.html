            <p>Have I done enough for paid employment yet?  What do the external examiners have to say?  Oh, you haven't gotten around to sending my work out yet.  Yeah, right.  What education and training system?  They pay Sterelny (past the age of 65) to be sooooo hostile and soooo competitive.  Sooooo comeptitive to undermine it all.  There isn't anything there.  Why did they even pay him?  He didn't do any teaching at all.  It had one job to do in fact (it takes the thesis and it gets it out to external examiners).  I mean, it could help make the thesis better since it's being paid to supervise.  But the most f*cking minimal thing that it could possibly do is to take the work and get it to externals.  There isn't anything there.</p>

            <p>They won't process complaints of wrongdoing.  There isn't anything there.  What education and training system?  What health system?  Detention prison camps and f*cking slavers.  Stanford Prison Camp Experiment.  The social construction of the prevention and prohibition of social development.  There's nothing there.</p>

            <p>They tell me (employees paid to advise prospective medical students) that I have to complete a new qualification from a NZ University to be eligible for enrolment in MBChB.  </p>

            <p>They tell them that they take PhD graduates and enrol them in Australian Universities to study medicine.  But not New Zealanders.  We aren't eligible for their HEX scam.  New Zealand Univeristies will enrol Australians claiming debt against their name while they put them to playschool passing themselves off as doctors in our hospitals while they pay and pay and pay and pay the `university'.</p>

            <p>They refuse to follow the laws.  The laws say that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible to be enrolled in qualifications they have applied to.  But they won't enrol them in qualifications they have applied to.  WOrse -- they enrol them in qualifications they have not applied to.  I did not apply to study anything at all with University of Waikato in 2019 but they have recorded levels of debt against my name for more fees when I never even applied to be enrolled with that institution.</p>

            <p>The laws say that NZ citizens are entitled to a free secondary education until they turn 20.  So they enrol them in tertiary institutions and record levels of debt against their name from when they are...  AUT was saying they had a 14 year old finance studnet from Vietnam enrolled with their institution.  What education and training system?  There isn't anything there.</p>

            <p>They put the `students' to unpaid labor doing all of the work while they don't even pay them.  They record more and more and more debt against their  name only.  Forcing them to live in student slum accommodation or Professors houses.  The first year students output more research (each one of them individually) than people who are paid to be Professors.  They won't get their studnets work out for external examination.  They hand it over to Professors from the northern hemisphere to pass of as research outputs of their own or their own studnets.  THey don't have oral defences because of all these doctoral qualifications they handed out to people who didn't even do the research they attribute to them.  They can't even explain it.  You can tell in a conversation with them.  Which is why they won't discuss academics.  Party party party it's compulsory it's important for your education to go away on camping trips!  What education and training system.  There isn't anything there.</p>

            <p>Prison detention camps.  Have I done enough for paid employment yet?</p>

            <p>The Office of the Ombudsman and the Privacy Commission are supposed to be NGO's.  THey are supposed to employ the most qualified person for the postion.  They advertise positions of all levels from most senior to most junior.  From permanent positions (where people can actually plan for a future) and it's only temporary positions for 3 or 2 or only 1 year.  I'm not qualified enough for any of that to even be offered an interview.  Yeah, right.</p>

            <p>There is nothing there.  Prison death camps.  CHristopher Whelan has not processed a single complaint of wrongdoing against the `universities' of NZ since he was appointed into his position of office in 2014.  We are supposed to believe that nobody is willing or able to process a complaint of wrongdoing so that they need to pay him quarter of a million dollars per  year.  Nobody else could possibly work that job.  It's too f*cking hard for  them to say `supply me with the evidence of wrongdoing so I can forward it to the police.  It is then up to that whether and when the government prosecutes the wrongdoing within the education and training system.</p>

            <p>They are keeping hostages.  Detention camps.  Prison camps.  A PhD is supposed to take 3-4 years only with 2 years minimum and up to 1 year of external examination.  THey won't get the work out to externals.  They won't do it.  There is not an education and training system there.  So, then, who do they payroll?  People who had their own theses go out for external examination?  They had publically scheduled oral defences?  When?  How come I have NEVER SEEN A SINGLE ONE.  All the seminars and talks that I've been to over however many years and I HAVE  NEVER SEEN A SINGLE PUBLICALLY SCHEDULED ORAL DEFENCE OF A DOCTORAL CANDIDATE.  There arent any doctors.  It is where the `best and the brightest' go off to die.  There is f*cking nothing there.</p>

            <p>They are dissolving or disestablishing the schools, now.  Start by merging the secondary schools with the primary schools and then make everybody apply for their old jobs with the restructure.  Then get people enrolled in primary school teachign qualifications only to do all of the teaching work while they pay and pay and pay and pay the university for their training scam.  Dissolve the polytech's and get the people who were previously on payroll to teach at tech to be re re re re re enrolled with the `university' so they can pay and pay and pay and pay and pay to be put to work passing themselves off as employees of the medical training programme.  Then get studnets (preferably from overseas) to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay to be enrolled in medical school so they can pay and pay and pay and pay to pass themselves off as doctors or nurses or healthcare assistants.  Maybe cleaners.  They will need to have a several decades long qualification in that and a decade at least long internship programme where they do all of the work while increasing levels of debt are recorded against their name only.</p>

            <p>There isn't anything there.</p>

            <p>Everybody knows the only reason they are forced to go to school is to hand their lunch money over to the bullies.  There isn't anything there.</p>

            <p>They are saying now they want pre pre pre pre pre testing on the pre tests for the pre testing of pre tests.  The various people on payroll would never pass the pre tests for the pre testing they would never pass the test to have their work be externally examined for NCEA or anything else.  Pay and pay and pay and pay the Cambridge Curriculum people.   Yeah, right.  If every kid gave $80 USD to Harvard as part of an application fee just think of how many libraries etc etc they could build.  How many people (sorry, `people') to be payrolled to be soooooo hostile and soooooo competitive.  To be abusive psychopaths to undermine the whole thing.  What education and training system?  People are supposed to pay and pay and pay money to Harvard to be taught by Jacinda, now?  Did she apply to do a doctorate then?  SHe did the work for that then?  Oh, she's thinking about writing a book one day.  Well, good for her.  Maybe write a book every f*ckign year for 7 years plus and then...  Well, when it's time to pay you it's time for you to die.  Right?  There isn't anything there.  F*cking death camps.</p>

            <p>They keep false IRD records saying that I owe them money for being enrolled with the University of Waikato in 2019.  But I never applied to be enrolled with that University in 2019.  There isn't a University.  They won't get the work out to externals.  They send it out to be externally examined for the wrong qualification.  When the only external examiner based outside NZ requests an oral defence be scheduled they keep false transcripts recording that the student failed to complete the qualification (because they wouldn't get the work out, they wouldn't get the work out for the qualification teh student applied to, because they wouldn't schedule an oral defence,  because they wouldn't get the updated thesis back to the external with sign off papers).  What University?  They don't have any graduates.  I mean, they will graduate people at the end of hteir third year and fourth year to make up numbers.  But where are all the PhD graduates?  Oh, they must have a different ceremony on another day.  The ANU doesn't have doctoral graduation ceremonies so far as I could see.  I never saw anybod in an ANU doctoral gown.  I never saw anybody give an oral defence.  What University? Prison slave detention camp.  Sterelny is sooooo hostile and soooo competitive.  There's nothing there.</p>

            <p>So, how are all these people on payroll, then?  How is Nick Southwood and Rachel Brown on ANU payroll as lecturers and researchers for the ANU when neither of them have reports from external examiners insofar as I know anything about it at all.  Neither of them had publically scheduled oral defences of their PhD where the external examiners asked them questions etc.  How is it that they are regarded to be graduates of the PhD Programme?  How are they on payroll?  What University?  HOw is it that they didnt' wear teh fancy gowns around University House?  How is it that I don't know of any PhD or doctoral functions or celebrations being held at University House?  All the time that I was there...  So many years in excess of what is required for them to get my work out to externals and they won't do it.  Ooooooh have I don't enough!  I'm sooooo worried that I haven't done enough!  Maybe I should cry and cry and cry for more and more and more extensions.  Sterelny is worried that I haven't done enough for PhD.  See what he regards to be a `few small chunks'.  F*cking psychopaths.  There isn't anything there. </p>

            <p>Macquarie University won't acknoweldge receipt of my applications to them.  I applied for a Post-Doctoral Fellowship when I was enrolled with the doctoral programme at the ANU and when it was time for Australia to pay me.  And they wouldn't even acknowledge receipt of my application.  They subcontract lecturing work to me so that Jeanette can spend her ARC fellowship grant on herself, presumably.  Instead of paying a post-doc to do research she subcontracts teaching to people who they won't get their work out to external examiners.  There isn't a University there.  They won't pay anybody to do the work.  Psychopaths on payroll. Bullying and abusive. </p>

            <p>How many years was Dave Wall kept re re re re enrolled in doctoral qualification before he was sent to hospital to nearly be killed by administering thimene before dextrose sending him into a coma.  How many years did he work  before his thesis went out for external examination?  HOw many years does he get to be tortured by Daniel Stoljar `I'm just going to have to stop you right there.  What do you meeeeeeeean by first key word of sentance one?  I just don't understand what you meeeeeeeeean.  No, you can't give a talk.  I don't have anything to say.  I'm not giving a talk.  You can't have anything to say.'</p>

            <p>How many decades was Carl Brusse kept re re re re re enrolled.  What happened to the first lot of thesis work that he wrote?  Did they give it to people from Princeton to pass off as their own?  Maybe someone soooo f*cking stupid that they were incapable of writing a thesis of their own.  Maybe someone on payroll already passed it off as their own.  Like how Fiona MacPhearson just took my work on delusions (that she heard in conferences when she took handouts of the work that I'd done in conferences) and then wrote it up and passed it off as her own.  F*cking psychopaths.  There's nothing there.  DOn't you want to join them?  Well, you would have to pay me.  No f*cking kidding.  You don't do it to associate with the best and brightest that's for sure.  They were all killed off years ago so that Sterelny could be the only game in town.  It's soooo hostile.  It's sooooo comeptitive.  It's sooo hostile and sooo competitive there's actually nothing there.  WE make it to slavery yet?  The f*cking death camps.</p>

            <p>Cry cry cry for nuclear submarines.  Cry cry cry for stallites.  We will need to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the people because they need a few more decades or generations yet to make a vaccine.  Nobody else need apply.  Nobody else was capable of workign that job.  Yeah, right.  What educationa nd training system?  What health system?  Murder.  Death.  Extermination camps.  THey won't get the work to externals.  They won't pay the workers.  THey don't want an educated population.  ANything that is done is done in spite of and despite them.  Certainly not because of them.  They aren't helpful at all they are soooooo f*cking hostile.  Sooooo competitive.  There's nothing there, at all.</p>
