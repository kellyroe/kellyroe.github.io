                             <p>I will try not to do  anything to break the links.</p>

                             <p>I am file re-formatting my work and organising it into yearly increments.  E.g., </p>

                              <a href="./writing/ks.png">Here is an example of an email from Kim Sterelny (who will not write me a reference) so you can see how he chooses to speak to me.</a> 

                              I collated the 'few small chunks' as he refers to them, here:
                              </p>

                                </p>

                                <p>2018 I wrote a 120 point MPhil for Waikato (because Auckland told me that they'd consider me for MBChB if I completed a new qualification from a NZ University).  I know it was a 120 point 1 EFT qualification --  because that's what I applied to be enrolled in only.  That was what I authorised to be charged to student loan only.  But the University ('university') of Waikato doesn't see it that way.  Quigley thinks he has unlimited power to charge whatever he likes to people's IRD.  He can record them being enrolled in programmes of study they never applied to!  Justice Toogood (over 65, pulled out from retirement for the occasion) doesn't see anything wrong with the 'university' of Waikato keeping false enrolment records.  </p>

                                <p>They refused to send 14 September 2018 thesis out to externals.  Refused to do it.  THey send a 05 October 2018 thesis out with instructions for externals to write `doctoral reports' of the under 50,000 words 120 point thesis only.  Of course they had to say that in order for it to be acceptable more words would need to be added (substantive changes).  But they sent it out to be externally examined for the wrong qualification!  I substantively updated it (and provided a commentary as to how I couldn't do everything the NZ examiner asked of me within the under 50,000 word length limit for the MPhil.  They refused to get the 24 February 2019 substantively updated thesis back to externals.  Never sent it out.  Never sent the commentary out.  30 June 2019 they send it out this time requesting MPhil examination only.  The external examiner doesn't know what year it is.  They wrote external examiners reports in 2019 signing the date as 2012.  FFS.  They request oral defence here:</p>

                                <p> <a href="./writing/OSex2019.pdf">Overseas Examiner's report of 2019 (he seems to think it's 2012)</a>  He asked for an oral defence.  So when is the oral defence?  Waikato updated my transcript to record F that I failed a qualification that I never even applied to be enrolled in.  Now Jacinda apparently gets 3 fellowships from Harvard (I don't know who would have written her a reference for a thing like that when I can't get references from Martin Davies or Kim Sterelny) because she's going to write a  book.  Really.  Really?  Or are they just going to take a book from someone else and cross out their name and write her name on it?  All honorary-like?  What University?  There's nothing there.  </p>
