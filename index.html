 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>Alright, so here's the story.  I am waiting on two things: </p> 

                                <p>(1)  The Australian National University.  They are locating my student records and saying something about why I left the ANU without recieving credit for a PhD.  I found this <a href="judicial-review/anu-enrolment.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Records </a>.  Hmm.  I didn't know that they were going to enrol me with part-time status.  They told me I was taking 1 full time year off to do course-work and teach in North Carolina.  Perhaps they thought they were being clever in conning or trickign me into being enrolled part-time so they could say I failed to complete the Degree in the minimum normal or standard time.  So, then, I can't do Medicine.  Because you need to be as young as possible for that.  They like them young.  TO know as little as possible.  To have as little life experience as possible.  I guess because there isn't anything there.  There isn't a health system, I mean.  There's just this program where you pay the University and they put you to work and then they don't give you your qualification.  You just keep paying them and they keep putting you to work.  And then, eventually, you die.  Yay.  What a wonderful life.
                                </p> 

                                

                                <p>(2)  The social security tribunal of New Zealand.  The New Zealand government chooses to keep me on less than minimum wage.  My applications for work are not progressed (positions will remain vacant and readvertised rather than employing me), I am not shoulder-tapped for work (as is customary).  My applications, work submitted for examination, course completions are not handled properly by New Zealand Tertiary Providers.  The courts won't progress my filings after justice was repeatedly denied to me in the High Court.  The social security tribunal of New Zealand believes that New Zealanders kept on welfare cannot have advance benefit payment to pay security for costs that the Supreme Court requires people kept on welfare to pay to have cases heard in the court of appeal when justice was denied to them in the High Court.  Hey, that's a good life.  You pay the courts, you pay the courts, you pay the courts, you pay the courts.  And then you die.  That's a wonderful life.  I'll add up all the money the courts say I owe the courts and the government for their failure to follow the laws that they wrote.  I guess I'll also put up evidence of the more than $80,000 that I owe the Ministry of Social Development for 'essential costs' including accommodation.  The costs were deemed 'essential' so I'm now required to pay the government that debt.  I have no debt -- except to the Government.  The Government loan sharks the people forcing them into debt in order to survive.  They don't even pay me enough to pay my rent, now.  I guess because I'm supposed to live in my supervisors house.  Giving him my work so he can publish that as his own.  Giving it to Jacinda to give to the UN?  Yay.  What a wonderful life. Present for healthcare and be detained in conditions of torture.  Count yourself...  Lucky??  You escaped with your life??
                                </p>

                                <p>I am aware that they think they can get free labor / free 'work' out of the things that I post to the internet so that stops.  Who profits?  Do the people in the USA like it when I spend my life documenting the crimes of the NZ government?  That's a good slave job for Kelly!!!!!  Document their crimes.  Document their crimes.  Document their crimes.  Shame we can't have health and education.  Document their crimes.  Document their crimes.  Document their crimes. The people don't have healthcare because they won't enrol, progress, graduate people, publically advertise jobs, employ people, pay people.  Just won't do it.  Nope.  Nothing to see here, people.  Sorry..  All your work was for nothing.  Pay ya later. 
                                </p>

                            <p>
                            The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications.  They define a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  
                            <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a> 
                            </p>

                            <p>Here is how much the Inland Revenue says I owe the New Zealand Government for my 'Education' and 'Training': 
  
                            <a href="judicial-review/ird-shot.pdf" target="_self"> $104,663.</a>

                            They have not provided a break-down of what courses they recorded me as having been enrolled in, in what year.  I have transcripts for some years that I will upload.  They acknowledge that I have completed BA(hons) and an MA (I can't tell whether they invoiced 1 year or 2 years or more of fees total for the MA - it looks to me from my transcript that they may have double-billed).  They refuse to acknowledge that I have completed anything since then.  They keep invoicing my student loan -- for courses that I never applied to be enrolled in (changing enrolment dates for more billings for them which make me look like I'm slow).  They take my research work, particularly, and give it to third parties without crediting me (or paying me).  They can't hire anybody to write anything on the UNDRIP in a timely fashion.  Nobody with that capacity lives or works, here.  The Governmetn won't allow anybody to work that job.  If it isn't worked by a slave...  There's some work free men won't do...  Well then.  Lie flat.  Play dead.  Die.   
                            </p>

                            <p>This is particularly clear with the 'Disability and Equity for Medicine and Public Health' thesis that I wrote.  I only wrote it because they said that writing it would be enough for them to consider my application on it's merits (GPA, interview score, UMAT/UCAT score) for Medicine with Auckland.  They took my thesis and used it for their own ends and they refuse to acknowledge that I wrote it.  And they refuse to progress my application to Medicine.  We don't have a health system.  We don't have an education and training system.  There's nothing here.  It's a detention camp is all.  There's nothing here.  The courts don't / won't / can't function.  There's nothing here.
                            </p>

                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  They aren't progressing the filings. 
                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  
                                </p> 

                            <p>
                            It seems to me that the Australian Constition explicitly states that New Zealand is regarded, by them, to be a State of the Federation of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  Australia refuses to honor it's own Constitution.  New Zealand seems to function as a detention camp of Australia only. 
                            </p>

                            <p>Here are  <a href="judicial-review/sup-court-waikato.pdf" target="_self"> My Filings </a>to the Supreme Court regarding the University of Waikato    
                            </p>

                            <p>The Social Security Appeal Authority  <a href="judicial-review/ssaa.pdf" target="_self"> Intention to schedule a phone call sometime after July 4. </a></p>

                          <p>You don't need to wonder why I have spent so much of my life wondering why I had to have been born.  Wishing I never had  been.  You can see how I'm valued.  Really valued.  Valued in the negative direction.  The government put a little mark or a brand beside my name at some point and recorded me as intellectually handicapped or something.  They treat me like I am intellectually handicapped or something.  That is how they treat people who they believe to be intellectually handicapped.  'Help' doesn't make sense.  It's sooooooooo competitive.  Didn't you know?  Why would anybody help you?  Help themselves to you.  Sure.  Why would anybody help you?  Why would anybody want to do Medicine?  I mean...  You can watch Shortland Street and know how you are meant to act in the hospital.  As a Doctor or a Nurse.  So...  Get to it then.  And pay the University.  Pay the University.  Never stop paying the University.  You could live in the hospital.  You could be live-in at Hillmorton.  On call 24/7.  Never stop paying the University...
                        </p>

                        <p>What's that?  Your qualification expires after 5 years?  Well, then, I guess you will have to star paying the University, all over again!  What's that?  Your test score on the test that cost you more than $1,000 to sit needs to be sat again?  Never stop paying the Registration people! Never stop paying!  Hey, you should pay for your ongoing training.  Never stop paying!   Never stop paying!  Never stop accumulating debt for your training!  Never stop getting deeper and deeper and deeper into debt for all the work that you do.  It's so valued.  You are such a valuable student!  Just keep paying!  Just keep paying!  Just keep paying!  Thanks so much for playing.  Hahahahhaahha.  Ooooh.  Pick me! Pick me!  Pick me!  I've always wanted to be a slaver.  Taking credit for other peoples work.  What I really really want is to have a bunch of slaves live in my house doing all my cooking and cleaning and washing my clothes and all of that kind of stuff.  I always wanted to manage or administrate the funds and order and boss everyone else around.  It's such a wonderful life!  Thanks for playing!  Pay ya later!
                        </p>

                        <p>Yeeeeeeeeeeeees Andrew Little.  It's a problem of 'perverse incentive'.  It's not the 'Problem of Evil' at all.  It isn't like..  There was not reason to believe in evil..  Until you saw the behavior of the people who were incentivised to maximise 'perverse outcomes', at all.  Sure.  Yeah.  Right.  Happy Human Perversity!!!!! Long Live!!! Heil...  Whoever believe in that, and all!!!!! YAy..  So Glad I was born to Such a Developed Nation!!!  Long live the reign of what it chose to invest in!!!! Happy Human Perversity!!!!  'N all!!!'
                        </p>

                        <p>I used to love going to conference!!!  Know why???  Because I worked really really hard on my paper.  Before conference.  And then I got to present my own research, at conference.  And hear what people thought (in real time) in response to my presentation.  Conference gave people time to think about what they had heard, at conference.  They could digest what they were presented.  Have a few drinks...  Have snacks...  Be able to ask shy questions 'I'm not sure that I understood what you were saying...  But if I did...  Then these were the sort of objections that occured to me...'  They were valuable because of the environment.  But then they got taken over.  They got taken over by people who wanted to go to conference in..  The most exotic luxury holiday environment all expenses paid by whomever...  And those people, then, also saw fit to not attend (or think about) the presentations of anybody else..  They would arrive at conference..  Hide away for several days (non attendance) writing their own mediocre (only took them couple days to write) proceedings.  Present that...  Then treat themselves to luxury dinners the students couldn't afford to go to (couldn't then quiz them on their proceedings)...  The degradation and devaluation of the conference.  Not worth going to.  Not worth paying anyone to go to.  I guess you just don't graduate me and then I can't speak to the quality (or not) of your conference proceedings anymore.  Some people get paid really rather a lot to ensure...  The lack of quality of the conference. Congrats.  Yay you.  You made it in life!!! You ruined it for everyone!!!  You win!!! Yay!!!!   Yay!!! Let's sing the praises of the victorious winners of the problem of evil!!! Wooot!!! Wooot!!!! Please drink some water so we can clap clap clap for the ...  Yeah..  Yay!!!!!!
