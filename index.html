                            <p>
                                <a href="https://kellyroe.github.io/writing/realmecv.pdf">Chronological CV</a>
                                There is a link to my CV that I have presently under consideration for various things.
                             </p>

                             <p>I will try not to do  anything to break the links while I update contents.  I am in the process of file re-formatting and reorganising my work. </p>

                             <p><a href="./publish/2010-rep.pdf">Roe, (2010).  Lecture notes for Philosophy and Cognitive Science.</a></p>

                            <p>I am moving the contents of the course I developed (available from the teaching tab) into a single link (book) format.</p>

                            <p>I think about all the courses that I chose to enrol in (took out debt to enrol in) because I was genuinely interested to study the readings.  Go along to the lectures.  Engage with the material.  Dialogue with other learners.  Various other people were on payroll.  They could have enrolled in those same courses (if they were actually intellectually interested) without payment of fees.  Even when they were payrolled and could have afforded to pay the fees.  But they weren't interested.  I suppose that was why they were payrolled.  Because they weren't academically or intellectually curious at all.  I think of all the seminars that I went to.  Listened politely.  Engaged.  Politely.  Asking questions.  In the seminar.  Or asking questions after the seminar.  Engaging with the speaker.  Trying to.  Trying to show a genuine interest.  Tell me, then, when did the speakers reciprocate that with me?  When did they show me that same courtesy?  How about the other ANU graduate students?  When did they show me the same courtesy that I showed them?  They said they weren't only my professional colleages.  They were my friends.  But they wouldn't work with me.  They wouldn't give me the same courtesy that I gave them.  With friends like these who needs enemies.  What are they payrolled now?  Please enlighten me.  And what is the total of their payroll over how many years, now?  What Universities?</p>

                            <p>Sterelny would say it's hostile and competitive.  Not  behaviourally modern, at all.  They've been taken over by psychopaths.  Indeed.  What Universities?  It's pretty clear why there will not be a functioning health system.  It's really very simple.  We don't want the people to live.  It's hostile.  It's competitive.  Why would we want to help people?  Help ourselves to people, more like.  There's really nothing there.</p>
