 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->

                            <article>

                                <p>
                                I did not have power of attorney so I did not push things.  I stated my concerns clearly.  I expect people to be able to assess the merits of what I have to say on it's merits.  That is to say it doesn't freaking matter where the message comes from when it comes to the quality of the message and the quality of the information. 
                                </p>

                                <p> 
                                I expressed concern that one hematology consultant had said "there is nothing more I can do" without telling her that she had the right to a second opinion and without providing her with a list of people she could seek out for a second opinion. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                On the other hand, when the Waikato Hospital was hacked it was in the news that people who were undergoing radiation treatment or thinking about starting radiation treatment could obtain a consulation from Tauranga or Auckland or possibly Australia while their file notes were temporarily inaccessible.  I offered to go with her to an appointment and strongly advised her to get an opinion so she could make a better decision as to what options there were and what it was that she wanted with her care.  She decided she did not want to (she was too tired to attend) a consultation in Tauranga or Auckland or Australia and she decided that she was happy with whatever the Waikato Hospital was going to offer her.  
                                </p> 


                                <p>I was concerned that they did not arrange a surgical consultation.  Apparently they didn't need to do this because they already knew what the surgeons would say.  That is not the same thing as a surgical consulation.  They did not not consider a stem cell transplant at all.  Apparently imaging (that I haven't seen) indicated masses on her spine (and inflammation) were causing paralysis.  I was concerned about that because the paralysis seemed to be consistent with a complete transection of the spinal cord.  I would think that a mass presenting on one side would have some a-symmetry.  I did wonder / worry that they were inducing the paralysis.  I also wondered if that sounded (or was) a bit paranoid.  I was having trouble making anatomical sense of her paralysis.  They would not show me the MRI.  They did radiation treatment to her masses around her spine causing paralysis, apparently -- but the magic marker locations were on her esophagus and her jaw.  They did not do follow up imaging to assess the effect of the radiation treatment even when she showed some signs of regaining a little movement and sensation.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                They said someone from her radiation oncology team would phone me and discuss with me the radiation treatment.  Whether there were possibilities for more radiation treatment and whether it might make more of a viable surgical target while she took a  break from meds for a bit due to toxicity.  They were adamant that paralysis was not a sign of toxicity from Ibrutinib.  Rather, a nurse phoned me to say I could stay with her in the hospital and they would help me care for her.  I said I booked an 11am bus back from Auckland since I needed to return overnight to collect a few things.  Then they arranged for her to be transferred to hospice before my bus arrived at the hospital around 2pm.</p>

                                <p>
                                I will get her file notes so I can understand the situation better.  It is possible she was worse (things were more advanced) from earlier on than she wanted to admit to me and perhaps to anyone at all.  I know she was fearful that decisions were being made about her, without her.  She was concerned that people may suggest painful radical procedures that were unlikely to help and she would be forced to take those treatments.  On the other hand, that's something to threaten people with so they accept whatever decisions have already been made.  She was a "good patient".  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I suppose the thing is, really, that I need to accept that I offered to go with her to a second opinion, and I strongly advised one.  The hacking made it very much possible for her to obtain one (I think it was the case that if she said she wanted one at that point in time that it would have happened relatively quickly).  But she, herself, in full charge of her cognitive faculties, decided that she did not want a second opinion and she was happy with her current consultant.  Then she would say that she didn't really understand what he was saying and that she wasn't really able to meet with him very much because of Covid restrictions.  But she was taking control of the situation in a way that was best for her.  So.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I suppose that is the thing of it, really.  People feel so powerless when it comes to death.  To dying.  To sickness and injury and disease.  And you take control in ways you can so that everything seems or feels that little bit more manageable.  It is hard to respect someones autonomy when you, yourself, are feeling powerless about the situation and are wanting to assert some kind of control in whatever limited way you can.  I think she did make decisions for herself that were well thought out (or not) as she saw fit.  She did not want me to weigh in significantly because she did not want me taking over.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I do want to learn from what happened.  For my own peace of mind / understanding.  I am glad I got to spend some high quality time with her near the end.  I am grateful that I tend to remember the good things and the best of her.  I do feel so very sad that she's gone.  It is a strange thing.  I suppose I thought that she was eternal in some way.  I suppose because she has always been there.  She was there before me and I suppose I thought she would be there after me, too.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I suppose she realised there was no point in her appointing me since the health system (also legal system) refuses to listen to or acknowledge anything that it is that I have to say.  
                                </p>
