 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>I started this website so that I could self-publish some of the writing that I have done, over the years.</p>
                                
                                <p>
                                Mostly in the context of other people refusing to sign off on my higher research work - while also refusing to get my higher research work to external examiners, so as to prevent them signing off on my work, too.  Not encouraging me or supporting me or helping me in getting my work to journals, etc. 
                                </p> 

                                <p>I put various pieces of writing here so that it they are less likely to turn up in someone else's work.  Or, if that happens, it may be more readily identified as plagarism.  That is to say I put things up here to make it less likely that people delay me (to eventually fail me out) in order to expediate my work through - via someone else.  Also to make it less likely that people will think that by failing me they will silence me.</p>

                                <p>I also started this website in order to document what is happening with me in the courts of New Zealand.  The University's of New Zealand instructed me to take them to Court if I did not like how they were treating me.  I put the cases up here so that the international community can see how New Zealand Universities treat their Graduate Research Students.  Also their first and second year studnets when it comes to entry to 'competitive' degree programmes where people are very invested in giving those places to their own children at the expense of everyone else.</p>

                                <p>If you have to work on a 1 EFT qualification for 12 months before submitting for external examination, external examination takes at least 3 months, you have to be enrolled when you submit your thesis in fulfilment of regualtions for the Degree, than a 1 EFT 12 months qualification will take at least 15 months to complete.  That is 3 months of unpaid labour, then?  How much unpaid labour, then at the end of a 3 EFT PhD?  Or is that a 4 year PhD?  Is that 4 years before the 'first examination'?  If you don't comply with University demands to 'keep working' and pay additional fees (or allow them to keep billing the government for additional funds for holding you hostage) then you are supposed to do what?  Leave without your qualification?  Take them to court?</p>

                                <p>Then for how many years do you work for the courts?  Without pay?  Or you do need to pay a lawyer else you can never win costs?  Is there any precedent for self-represented applicants to win costs?  How about compensation for their time?  Are they to be kept as slaves to the courts, then?</p>

                                <p>Would you like to do business with New Zealand?  We have very high rates of child abuse, here.  We have very high rates of suicide.  We don't know what 'informed consent' means.  I don't mean we temporarily lost the plot of it during Covid Times.  I mean we lost the plot of it before Covid Times.</p>

                                <p>I wrote my MPhil Thesis in 2018.  Before Covid.  I talked about how Medicine (as in being a Physician) doesn't make sense in a competitive environment.  It doesn't make sense to think that Psychiatrists are helping people with mental illness in a place where people are diagnosed with mental illness as a means or method to discredit them, socially ostracise them, and perhaps to attempt to justify involuntary detention and forced medication of them.  It doesn't make sense to think of helping the disabled or incapacitated or sick or vulnerable or infirm when the very point of competition is to disable, incapacitate, sicken, weaken etc.  I am not sure that there is sense to be made of health, education, justice, in New Zealand.  I'm still waiting.</p>
