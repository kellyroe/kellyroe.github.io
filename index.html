                            </p>

                            <p>I have provided clickable links to how I calculated my GPA.  The only reason I go on about my GPA is because they say that entry to Medicine is `highly selective' or `competitive' -- on the basis of GPA, primarily.  But they do not seem to be selecting candidates on the basis of their GPA when they proritise entry for teenagers (who haven't even completed 1 year of University study) or they prioritise adults (who have attained the age of 20 years) who, again, haven't even completed 1 year of University study.</p>

                            <p>In more recent years they have basically stopped grading things properly.  They won't get work out for external examination.  They think that they can decide who gets what grades in a manner or way that is independent from the academic merits of the work the student has done.  They think they get to judge the academic merits on the basis of really important things like the studnets photograph, who their daddy is etc etc.  What education and training system?</p>

                            <p>I am fairly sure that my work was given to other people so they could re-skin it and claim it for themselves.  Fiona McPhearson took my work on delusions.  I think John Matthewson took my work on functions.  I don't know how many PhD's worth Carl Brusse wrote before he was credited as author of 1.  Who claimed credit for the first one he wrote?  Someone from Princeton?  What education and training system?  Sterelny is so hostile and so selfish and nobody actually works together.  He's over the age of 65 and it's time for him to be declared retired.  Not on payroll anymore.  Get out.  </p>

                            <p>They aren't doing informed consents.  The things they do in the name of `medical science research'.  The atrocities.  The entire point of an `education and training system' is the prevention and prohibition of social mobility.  Didn't you know?  Off to the death camps with ya, now!  What education and training system?  They won't even get the work out for external examination.  But even if they did, they got it out for the wrong qualification.  But even if they did, they wouldn't get the substantively updated work back out to externals.  But even if they did, they wouldn't allow the externals to sign off.  But even if they did they wouldn't allow an oral examination or defence.  Then the external examiner doesn't even know what date it is!  Can't even tell the year!  It's now 2012 all of a sudden!  No education and training system here!</p>

                            <p>Well quickly now, quickly quickly!  Let's pull Justice Toogood out of his retirement so that he can't see anything wrong with the untimely deaths of Mason Pendrous or Olivia Podmore in their state care institutions.  He can't see anything wrong with the `University' not getting the work out for external examination.  He's past the compulsory age of retirement for Judges and he simply cannot see anything wrong!  He's paid and he's paid and he's paid and he's paid because he simply cannot see anything wrong!  Removal from office would be one solution -- but that's an archaic law and none of the judges past the compulsory age of retirement can see anything wrong with them needing to be killed before they will get out.  All voluntary-like.  Off to the aged care institutions for them, I suppose.  They would have things no other way.  I see now why they need to select the Medical Students that they do.  To manage the immunisations, sorry, euthanasias, sorry, the `you have been consented you have been volunteered these are the shots for you'.  They would have things no other way.  </p>

                            <p>Half my working life there hasn't been employment for me.  They'll get people in from overseas rather than payrolling me.  They'll keep various people over the age of 65 on payroll rather than payrolling me.  There isn't anything here.  Land of abusive bullies.  We see what is valued here.  The prison detention camp of the world.  The leaders of here would have things no other way.</p>
