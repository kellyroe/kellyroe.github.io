 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->

                            <article>
<p>This website documents how Australasia decided to stop having Universities in favor of having unlawful detention camps where they have people working as forced volunteers or slaves or whatever you want to call it.  It documents how they (1) refuse to enrol students (particularly domestic adults) in programmes of the students choosing because they believe they know  better than the student what qualification is right for them.  They make these decisions on non-academic grounds.  For example, making decisions about certain students needing to be enrolled in what they consider 'low value qualifications' because they have decided on the basis of information they have collected (e.g., race, decile or socio-economic status rating of the students parents, socio-economic status rating of the students high school).  
</p>

<p>The website documents how they refuse to get graduate research to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit the work being examined by international community where independent examiners who don't know anything about the students socio-economic status or race or age or for how many decades the student has been forced to keep slaving for the university because the university refuses to get their work out to external examiners for examination because they have decided to traffick in slaves, only.</p>

<p>From supervisors simply refusing to do the job for which they are paid (refusing to supervise the student) to supervisors only playing a prevention and prohibition and stabotage role (instructing the student to make changes that were different from those required by external examiners that were likely to make the thesis less likely to be acceptable to international community) to the university simply refusing to get work to externals.  To the University keeping false enrolment records (recording enrolment in courses the student never applied to be enrolled in) to keeping false transcripts (recording false enrolment details and recording that a student was forced to '...' continue the programme under re-enrolment else 'F' was failed by the university for the programme -- because the university refused to get the students work out to external examiners.</p>

<p>This webiste documents how both the Australian National University and The University of Waikato refuse to get my research work out to externls.  ANU refused to supervise (apparently they don't have anybody employed in the philosophy programme to supervise graduate research) and Waikato did not really supervise ('I'm off on my holiday now see ya!!') and then instructed me to make changed different from the ones the externals required.  E.g., externals required changes to the substance within 10 weeks and the univeristy refused to get the thesis that I supplied within 10 weeks out to externals. They recorded I re-enrolled for six additional months before they would get the thesis out to externls.  Then when the external examiner (the only examiner outside the southern hemisphere) stated they wanted an oral examination (to see why the university was failing me) they recorded on my transcript that I failed.</p>

<p>The Australian Natioanl University would not accept my complaint to them.  They asked me to revise and resubmit my complaint 3 times and then they instructed me to rewrite my complaint clearer because they hadn't accepted that they received a complaint from me.</p>

<p>They have all had every opportunity to put things right internally and they refuse.  Australiasia does not have tertiary education.  They have a system of slavery and detention camps only.
    </p>

<p>If you look at how this part of the world advertises jobs and fails to fill them with people willing and able to do the job (in favor of people who will keep some segment of society in conditions of deprivation and abuse, effectively) then you can see the race to the bottom that is Australasia.  They don't appear to have any kind of self-preservation instict or desire at all.</p>

<p>The Judiciary also fails to function.  You can see over on the Judicial Review page that they do not appear to be willing and / or able to output a sensible judgment.  The one or two that I received from the courts early on were over-turned.  I was informed that the landlord (who intentionally wired a house to be a fire hazard) has subsequently moved to Queensland so he can continue on his good works over there.</p>

<p>There is nothing in Australasia.  Or, there is nothing for me in Australasia.  They like to exterminate people when it comes time to pay them.  Trying to be like the USA around the time when the endentured servants arrived and happened to die of maleria (shall we say) when it was time for them to be paid for the work that they had done.  It is in the Australian Constitution that NZ is a sate of australia but NZ and Australia both refuse to accept that.  Australia will not supply voting papers to NZ and they try and keep NZ as a detention camp for Australia where the idea seems to be that by treating people as badly as they can they will somehow motivate and inspire people to want to move to Australia.  That seems to be the reward granted to people who have exterminated enough New Zealanders.  For example, Kim Sterelny, after all the work he did undermining the Victoria University of Wellington (I would imagine it's about double or triple billing for keeping students enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and asisgnign credit for some peoples work to other people and so on) he got appointed to roll out the same dis-establishment campaign for the ANU.  So that now the administration says they don't have the willingness or ability to supervise gaduate research in teh philosophy programme.  For example, Harlene Hayes.  All the work she did culminating in her refusing to sign off on completion of qualification for 1/3rd the medical cohort in Otago (refusing to acknowledge that they'd been signed off as having completed their internships at the places the univesrity arranged and approved for them to do their internships in).  Her reward for undermining Medicine at Otago (such that a bunch of non-graduates are not-paid they pay the university they pay the university they pay the university to 'work' in our hospitals) is that she now gets to go roll out the same stabotage and undermining plan for the University of Western Australia.
</p>

<p>Apparently they don't need to sign me off becuase there never will be a job for me.  But lots of people they have signed off, there aren't jobs for them.  I mean, New Zealand never really acknowledged ANU graduates.  And also never really graduated it's own people.  Never really acknowledged it's own graduates.  But now the idea/l is that people from NZ who have already been picked to lead on personal (e.g., political) grounds can simply be given (or simply buy) honorary degrees from Harvard, for example.  That will be acknowledged only insofar as they were paid for or brought or purchased for all the wrong (non-academic) reasons.  That appears to be the value of a qualification.  That is to say, there is no value to the qualification.  Except that the people picked for all the wrong reasons feel less threatened, now, that they have the fancy titles.  That they are the only ones with the fancy titles.  And then everyone will catch on that the fancy titles don't mean anything...  And then maybe there can be such a thing as academics gain once the people who didn't want to do it anyway all piss off and go do whatever it is that they value.</p>
