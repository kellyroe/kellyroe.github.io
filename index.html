 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>Forget about Harry Potter.  Seriously...  Play Hogwarts Legacy, not because it is anything at all to do with Harry Potter.  Play it simply because it is AAA gaming at its very very best.  It is an incredible game.  Best in class in so many ways.  Room to improve, of course.  But it advances so many aspects.</p>

                                <p>For example, it is very well engineered.  I mean to say the UI is wonderful.  I am interested to know whether people playing on computer are using a console controller (which 'system' of controller they prefer (Nintendo, Playstation, X-Box key binding) or whether they are using keyboard and mouse...  </p>

                                <p>It is a difficult game to play in many respects.  Mostly because of the complicated or complex key bindings.  Or use of the controller.  But it is so well engineered.  I mean to say, the number of actual things is kept...  Manageable.  The number of different enemy types, the number of potion types, the number of forigables.  Everything is kept manageable.  And so that means that everything gets it's proper use.  I mean to say, it feels like something that could be mastered, if that makes sense.  A lot of old school RPGs were a bit too complicated.  So you don't end up using potions or scrolls, say.  But a lot of new school console RPGs are a bit too simple...  This one, IMHO, feels nice to play.  It is simple in so many ways.  It isn't trying to be complicated.  But it does get complicated all  by itself.</p>

                                <p>I do not know what is going on with the broom control and the camera rotation.  Something feels off, but I don't know what it is.  The camera doesn't budge and then it swings wildly.  There are settings you can play with.  So many settings that you can play with...</p>

                                <p>I really like the way the game is broken down into main quest, exploration, etc.  That way you can aim to play a balanced game, if that makes sense.  Decide how to spend your time.  It is perhaps a bit of a shame it doesn't have the world that levels with you like Elder Scrolls.  I mostly feel over-leveled and I haven't done much exploration...  But it's common to play on higher difficulties if you are not just mainlining the main quest line, I suppose.  I do not claim to be any good.  The dualing prompts are nice, too.  And the fact that there aren't too many spells.  It's a bit of a feat getting used to the key bindings / controller, though, yeah.</p>

                                <p>I think I have a bit more trouble than most  because of playing different games (e.g., different games put jump on different keys.  Then also remembering where the keys live on the different controllers (thanks Nintendo).  But then you are changing what keys are on your slots so it's about being flexible, I guess.  Yeah.  Learning to get good with the controller.  I remember that was the trouble with second life.  They thought the learning curve was too steep on naviating the environment.  Let's see how the kids and older people alike find playing a game like Hogwarts. </p>

                                <p>They do make use of a pointer at various points.  So that is a bit slow.  Not having a mouse.  Shame they aren't using track-pad functionality that is built into the playstation controller for that?  I don't know...  I would be interested to play it with keyboard and mouse to compare...  But that would involve a PC or...  A SteamDeck, of course.  That allows you to purchase games for portable and docking and use a keyboard and mouse rather than having to purchase a console port of the game which restricts your use of controller...  Hrm...</p>

                                <p>I mean, it is like they are turning (trying to turn) the wizarding world into a RPG.  I mean to say, that is basically what they are doing with the game.  It is a RPG set in the wizarding world.  And they take care to develop the world to nod to other schools in other countries and so on so that there is a sense of the world getting bigger rather than closing in around Hogwarts as the centre of the Universe.</p>

                                <p>One aspect that they don't do (that is perhaps a bit strange) is...  Well, Fire Emblem Three Houses did the idea of you having different relationships with different characters on the basis of what house you picked.  People going into Hogwarts thinking that their house will make a difference to the characters they will interact with in game will  be disappointed that they didn't really develop the characters in game.  Rather, they focused on building the castle and grounds and a town and also building a surrounding region of Scotland.  It is brilliantly designed with different layers of secrets that get you going over the same ground with increasing eye for finer detail.  They really encourage and reward you taking your time to look around and go back and look again.  That means you start to feel used to and comfortable in the environment.  It starts to feel cozy and familiar. </p>

                            

                                <p>Hogwarts Legacy</p>

                                <p>Apparently the author of the books (she who must not be named) has spoken out openly against trans people.  I say 'apparently' because I have not encountered it -- but then I have not heard anything at all from the author, and I don't have any interest in searching out for those kinds of comments, if that makes sense.  I am not going to do a search trying to find a bunch of comments against trans people -- whether they are things that have been said by her, or by anybody else.  So, I haven't looked into it.  I'll just accept that it might well be true.  I'm more interested in the effects of the wide publicity that this is true.</p>

                                <p>There has been some suggestion that people boycott the recent game release because any support of the franchise is support of the author is a statement of opposition against trans people.  The game has become politicised, I mean to say.</p>

                                <p>What has the result been?  Well, I suppose I think it likely that trans charities have been receiving more support than they ever have before.  Due to this issue being raised.  I mean to say, that fans of the series have possibly felt some obligation or pressure to say something openly in support of or at least tolerant of trans people so as to be clear that they are not anti-trans in purchasing the game.  Or in their decision to read or re-read books in anticipation of game launch.</p>

                                <p>The game developers have really done a pretty great job (IMHO) of having different characters with apparent and actual different cultural backgrounds.  In having characters who may or may not be trans or gay or whatever.  I'm only part way through it so who knows what will happen with plot lines or whatever, but it seems to me to be a game that is more tolerant of diversity than most everything else that there is out there. </p>

                                <p>Consider actual universities and high schools.  Ones that have boarders.  They are most often not accepting of trans or even gay students.  In part because of the requirement that people sleep and change clothing etc in gendered dorms or twin share rooms or are segregated for use of bathrooms.  This results in awkwardness and discomfort.  And everybody knows the best thing to do when you feel awkward and uncomfortable is to see out the external source of that and exterminate it.  Make it go away.  Run it out of town.   </p>

                                <p>Anyway...</p>

                                <p>I was feeling a little silly about it.  But it is actually a pretty great game, so far.</p>

                                <p>What sold me on it was learning that you don't play as Harry Potter and all of the characters are new because it is set in a different time.  Then seeing the game developer previews of what they had developed.  Seeing how they did a really nice job of managing expectations careful not to over-hype things.  Seeing how beautiful the architectural and design elements and features were.  It's really lovely to see the care that was taken around that.</p>

                                <p>One of the things I am enjoying, that I don't think I have heard anybody else say, is that you do not get to play *as you*.  I mean to say, you have some control over the appearance of the character you play, and you have some decisions about what you say in conversation, but your character clearly has a clear personality and style.  It is very obvious to me, when I am playing the game, that I do not feel at all like the character is *me*.  Someone...  Who I might like to befriend...  Someone a bit bolder than me etc?  Yes.  That's it.  That's the sense or the feeling.  At least it is, so far, for me.</p>

                                <p>Partly it is the way they talk etc.  The accent and so on.  So there is a sense of watching the theatre unfold rather than living out ones own personal fantasy (which was actually an idea that made me feel not so good about the game).  It doesn't feel like it is specifically for children (for childish fantasy if that makes sense) even though it clearly is a family friendly game.  That's actually a thing..  Right?  How to think and talk and feel about trans and gay in an environment that isn't overly or overtly sexualised.  Making sense of that.  Disintangling personal identity from issues of sexual abuse.  Because of, you know, Dr Leeks and various other people trying to teach the kiddies to be happy being pimped out to the judge or the people wanting to play doctors and nurses on weekends, or whatever...  So then people start thinking that homosexuality or trans identity is intrinsically tied to the issue of sexual perversion.  That normalising gay or trans means building a great monument to the likes of Dr Leeks for all the valuable work that he did pimping the children who were wards of the state out, and so on.  I mean, everybody knows that the government and the government workers know what gender identity and sexual identity is right for you.  In the name of important scientific research, no doubt (can you think of a better 'exuse', 'rationale', or 'justification' for atrocities against humanity than 'important scientific research' where we sacrifice a few (the most vulnerable) for the preferences of the elite white minority?  I surely cannot...  Which is why they get all the training places and graduations and employment.  Clearly...</p>

                                <p>One example of removing a cringe-worthy aspect of childish fantasy is changing the game from one where Gryffindor was the best house that won everything because the teachers gave all the points to Gryffindor teachers pets because they liked them more...  Who wants to play a fantasy where you get to be one of the elite white minority?  They seemed to be genuinely trying not to make it be a game about that.  Which was nice.  Of course there is a story, there...  Things don't make sense..  But then, neither did the books or the films.  It's a beautiful stylised game world with diverse and attractive characters and it feels stylish and beautiful to play...  Yeah...  Exceeds expectations.  Happily.    </p>

                                <p>I suppose the politicised approach has the function of cutting off potential criticism of the game because the elite white are butt hurt that they are expected to spend time with people of different cultures.  Or that there are gay and trans characters in the game.</p>

                                <p>Of course it is interesting about the 'childish magical thinking'.  I mean to say, flush toilets.  The grandeur of the place.  The opulance.  Such a thing could only exist in the wizarding world.  Such an opulent castle that is kept warm by magic etc.  It couldn't be a real place, of course.  I suppose it is interesting also because many kids feel cheated out of education, I suppose, because of Covid.  And then because of corruption.  Maybe the corruption came first.  Them being places of competition where the aim is to eliminate as many as possible so the children of the elite can be winners in some Darwinian survival of the fittest sense.  Since they don't seem to have aspirations or goals to be much of anything other than animals.</p>

                                <p>__________</p>

                                <p>Let's see...  First year...  1,500 word essays x 2 for a total of 3,000 words of edited, referenced, essay work per paper.  9 papers in my first year (8x8 + summer school).  That is 27,000 words of output.  Of course, I wrote 3 hour exams, as well, but we are talking about highly edited referenced, researched work.  27,000 in my first year.  Actually more because 2 of those papers were at stage 2 level.  Actually maybe a bit less because of logic...  But close to 30,000 words of research in one year in my first year.  As a first year student.  Then I had a couple years off (my brother died, I could not afford suitable housing etc).  Then 2 x 2 + 1 for a year when I studied part time during the academic year.  Then another 4x4 + 1 to complete the degree requirements.  Third year..  Let's see..  Probably more like 2 x 3,000 word essays for each class and then exams.  6,000 words per class for 9 classes is a total of 54,000 words in my third year.  Of well references research work.  Then my honors year.  4 year long papers (Y course code) for a 120 point full time workload -- and summer school, again.  I remember 5,000 word essays x 2 for each paper for a total of 40,000 words plus summer school.  Then we get to Masters...  And, what?  I fell on my head all of a sudden?  Can't do 50,000 words in one academic year all of a sudden?  Does that seem likely or plausible to you, does it?</p>

                                <p>What is the research output of people working in the Philosophy and English (say) departments in New Zealand Universities?  5,000 words per year?  I know that there are corruption problems with journals.  But there isn't anything to stop them giving departmental talks.  Is there?  Going to conferences and presenting their work that way.  Putting their work up on University website or whatever.  What is their work output?  THey say 'we don't have academic freedom to do research'.  Maybe.  But maybe also they were hired specifically because they don't have the willingness and / or abiltiy to output a research output.  They were supposed to steal their studnets work.  Right?  Because if it were merit based they wouldn't have a job at all?  Is that the concern?  That's what admin likes to tell them.  I think.  That's the nature of the bullying abuse.  To shut them down.  What University?  There's nothign there...</p>

                                <p>I say 'with friends like these who needs enemies  because..  Who is standing up for me?  Which of  my 'friends' thinks that it isn't fair that the ANU never got my work out to externals?  Which of my 'friends' thinks that it isn't fair that Waikato never got my 14 September 2018 work out to externals?  My 05 February 2019 work out to externals?  My 24 February 2019 work out to externals?  My 05 October 2018 thesis out with instrutions for externals to examine the thesis with respect to acceptability for the qualification that I had f*cking well applied to, and been working 'under supervision on' over the preceeding academic year?  Which of my friends conclude I must  be 'garbage' therefore no point getting my work out for external examination at all?   Which of my 'friends' thinks that it is unfair that Auckland and Otago refuse to process my application to enrol on the basis of academic merit?  I'm not complaining that they didn't enrol me.  I'm complaining that they didn't assess my application to enrol on the basis of academic merits.  They refused to apply their published selection algorithm to my application.  Can you hear the difference?  What friends?  What would you call me if the situation was reversed and it was your theses that weren't being sent out to externals?  Would you think that was friendly of me?  Would you think that was professional of me?  Would I have stood up for you?  Yes.  I would have spoken out if I knew that the Unviersity was refusing to get your work out for examination.  Whether we were friends or not.  Thanks.  Great friends, hey.  With friends like these...  I was happy for others when good things happen for them.  When they graduate.  When they get nice feedback.  When they get jobs.  Why didn't these people want me to have those things too?  With 'friends' like these...</p>

                                <p>The transcript of the High Court Proceedings for Roe v University of Otago would show that  the Justice kept insisting that I was wrongly claiming to be 'entitled'
                                to  be enrolled in MBChB.  I stated very clearly to the Justice in both my written submissions and in persson before the court that I did not maintain that I was 'entitled' to be enrolled.  Rather, I maintained that I was 'eligible' to be enrolled.  THe Judge refused to hear that.  The Judge insisted on mischaracterising the issue that I  brought before the courts in his written judgment as my having a false sense of entitlement.                         </p>

                                <p>What is the difference?  The difference is that the Education and Training Act states quite clearly that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are 'eligible' to be enrolled in the programme that they have applied for.  The University of Otago was refusing to supply applications to at least some domestic adults (e.g., myself) on grounds that the University deemed them to be 'ineligible'.  But they do not have the statutory power to deem domestic adults 'ineligible'.  The University is supposed to follow the statute.  And they refuse.  The Judge is supposed to order or instruct the Univerity to follow the statute else remove the responsible parties from office if they are unwilling and / or unable to follow the statute.  But they will not.  </p>

                                <p>They are not just refusing to supply applications to enrol (on grounds that they have deemed people to be 'ineligible' who are in fact eligible by statutory law of New Zealand).  They are also throwing away applications that they have received from eligible applicants BEFORE they have considered the application on it's academic merits.  Peter Crampton, Andrea Howard, Bryan Hyland, and John Reynolds have all been involved in using their positions such as chair of the Medical Admissions Committee, administrator, Deputy Chair, to throwing away applications to MBChB before the application has even  been placed before the Medical Admisions Committee for the application to be considered on it's academic merits alongside the other applications that have been received.  They say they can throw them away instead of considering them on their academic merits because they have deemed the applicant 'ineligible' but they do not have the power to proclaim that.  They are acting ultra vires refusing to supply applications to applicants who are eligible by statute, refusing to process applicatons on the basis of their academic merits.  </p>

                                <p>It would be interesting to know if all of these individuals have at least one child, each, who was accepted in MBChB at one of the Univerties in Australasia.  I mean to say, if administration is so corrupt as to removing applicants from the applicant pool so as to ensure or improve the selection of other candidates.  A sort of reverse equity using public resources (medical training places) for private advantage.  Because only their children are 'entitled'.  Sometimes people give the places to the children of administration outright.  For example, the daughter of the VC of the Univeristy of Queensland knew that his daughter was offered a place in MBChB in QUeensland even though she was not rank order scored  high enough for a place on the basis of her academic merits.  Other times they send their children to a different University.  Swap them so it is less obvious to everyone how corrupt they are.</p>

                                <p>So Justice Gendal was...  Pulled out of retirement, was he?  To refuse to judge the case I actually brought before him...  To write up a straw-man case and accuse me of bringing something unwinnable before the courts.  Costs are awarded against me because I was wrong that I was entitled.  I never claimed to be entitled.  I claimed to be eligible.  Roe v University of Auckland established that I was eligible by statute.  It's not that f*cking hard to see the problem, here.  Corruption with the courts, now, too.  </p>

                                <p>___</p>

                                <p>People are saying that I did not meet ANY of the requirements for enrolment in MBChB with the University of Auckland.  That is false.  I met ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS.  That is what makes their refusal to supply me with an offer of enrolment wrong.  Do you follow?  Can you hear that?</p>

                                <p>What were the requirements?  First, you had to be eligible to be enrolled in that progarmme.  Was I eligible?  Yes.  I was.  In virtue of my being a domestic adult who has attained the age of 20 years.  The Education and Training Act states that I am eligible to be enrolled in the progarmme I have applied to.</p>

                                <p>Does that mean that the University of Auckland is required to enrol ALL of the domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years?  Since they are ALL eligible, by statute?  The answer to that is, no.  There can be reasons why the enrolment numbers need to be limited.  This is something that can be questioned.  This is not something I have chosen to question. I accept the cap on the number of studnets to be enrolled for the purposes of this discussion.  </p>

                                <p>So, then, if there are more eligible applicants than there are available places in the programme how are they to decide who to enrol?</p>

                                <p>The University of Auckland has published a selection algorithm that they state they will use in order to rank order score candidates who are eligible, for hte purposes of selection.  This algorithm involves UMAT / UCAT score, interview score, and GPA.  There are specific instructions on how they are to calculate the GPA.  It is to come from the last 2 years of graded full time study (at least 120 points in 1 year for full time study) including summer school papers when those summer school papers are above stage 1.</p>

                                <p>The Education and Training Act allows that candidates may be preferred on equity grounds.  That means to say a studnet who scores lower may be offered a place even though they didn't score well enough, in the interests of promoting equity.  Equity grounds, for Auckland, include disability.  That means to say a candidate with disability may be selected even though their rank order score isn't quite high enough.  This is for the purpose of ensuring that the population of medical students and future doctors is more diverse than it would be otherwise.  I did not ask for equity consideration to be applied to my application.  That means to say, I asked Auckland to rank order score me for selection the same as everybody else.  I did not ask for them to give me special promotion on equity grounds. </p>

                                <p>So..  What was my rank order score then?  Was it high enoguh for offer of place?  If there are 250 places, for example, then was my rank order score somewhere between 1 and 250?  Or, if 50 candidates were promoted on equity grounds then was my rank order score between 1 and 200?  Do you follow?</p>

                                <p>What was my rank order score for selection in 2019 and again in 2020?  Was it high enough for the University of Auckland to be required to enrol me (given how many equity candidates they admitted in that year)?</p>

                                <p>Do you follow?</p>

                                <p>The answer to that question is...  The University told me that it was not high enough for offer of place.  I said I did not believe them and asked for evidence of how they chose to calculate my rank order score.  They supplied me with information as to how they calculated it.  HOw they calcualted it was different from how their algorithm told them to calculate it.  For example, they used one part time year where I did less than 120 points in one year. But their algorithm states they will use full time years, only, where the student did at least 120 points in that year.  They also did not calculate the best 120 points in a year where I did excess of 120 points.  Instead, they calculated my worst 120 points.  But I did a summer school paper in that year that was above stage 1 specifically for the purposes of bringing up my full time GPA.  IN response to my providing this information to the University (along with my own calculation where my GPA, according to their algorithm was 8.6) the University said that my GPA did not matter because they proclaimed me to be ineligible to have applied.  But, Justice Fitzgerald pointed out, they do not have authority to say that domestic adults are not eligible to apply.  The statute proclaims domestic adults to be eligible. </p>

                                <p>So, why didn't Justice Fitzgerald proclaim that they way they handled my application to enrol in MBChB was ultra virae?  That was what I asked her to do.  They did not have the power to decline my application on grounds of 'ineligiblity' because the Edcuation and Training Act prohibits them from doing that.  Rather, they were required to process my application on it's merits.  Same as everybody else.  I didn't ask for equity consideration.  Why didn't Justice Fitzgerald order or instruct them to go away and calculate it properly, according to their selection algorithm, since I was eligible in fact?  She accepted what I said (their lawyers accepted what I said if you listen to the transcript Bell Gully lawyers accepted my GPA for purposes of selection was 8.6).  But the University of Auckland refused to state what my correctly calculted rnk order score was.  And Justice Fitzgerald failed to require them to go away and deliver a judgement on my rank order score that was produced in accordance with their selection algorithm that they published for the purposes of their own accountability.</p>

                                <p>So, that's Otago and Auckland.  Not being fair, at all, in how they go about selecting what studnets to enrol in MBChB.  The worst of it is that they aren't sort of sneakily doing it surreptitiously...  Rather, they are choosing to use taxpayers dollars to hire major firms and senior counsel for themselves to defend their entitltement, they believe they have, to pick nd choose whatever studnets they want to enrol for whatever arbitrary reasons they have.  If you look at what students they choose to enrol in fact, I am not too sure what you see.  The children of the administration?  That seems most likely in fact.  They tell people that they aren't good enough, particularly that they aren't academically strong enough, but they are not making decisions on the basis of applicants academic strengths at all.  They are not even trying to be fair.  They choose to hire lawyers to defend their sense of entitltment.</p>

                                <p>The University of Auckland informed me in about 2017 or similar that I was 'ineligible' to apply for MBChB.  That was false, but that was what they told me.  I was acting on the basis of information that they provided to me, when I applied to enrol in a 120 point MPhil thesis with the University of Waikato.  The University of Auckland stated that finishing the 120 point qualification in the 'minimum, normal, or standard time' associated with the qualification would be sufficient for them to regard me to be eligible for MBChB.  The only reason why I applied to the 120 point MPhil programme was because I had been given this advice from the University of Auckland.  Advise, as it turns out, that was very very very very very costly for me.  Both with respect to money (enrolment fees) and also my time.</p>

                                <p>The University of Waikato then refused to process my enrolment for the qualification that I had applied to.  Now, this was not because there were more applicants to the qualification than there were places available in the programme.  I believe (but I do not know) that I was the ONLY APPLICANT TO THAT PROGRAMME.  The programme was listed in the University Calendar.  THe progarmme was approved by the Tertiary Education Commission as being 'right sized' and so on.  But they refuse to process my applicatino to enrol in it.  I applied by the published deadline.  ANd they simply refused to process the application.  Instead, they enrolled me in a qualification with a course code that is not listed in the University acaademic calendar, at all.  They enrolled me in a qualification that I never applied to be enrolled in, with very differnet start dates.  Regardless, I stayed in regular email contact with the person who was my supervisor including sending her work every week so she could see my progress.  She sent me emails saying that she was off on various family holiday trips.  That was nice for her.  All year, the University refused to accept that I was going to submit the 120 MPhil on 14 september to allow up to 3 months externl examination of my thesis so as to make up to 10 weeks of changes, that I thought the externals would likely require, so that I could then have it submitted in hardcopy without re-enrolment being required of me.</p>

                                <p>Three softboudn copies were track and trace signed for by the research school and the Dean refused to get the thesis out for external examination in order to prevent and prohibit external examinaers from signing off on my timely completion of the degree.  The University told me that I was required to 'keep working' and submit a thesis for examination at a later date.  After a couple weeks I supplied them with another thesis and they send the under 50,000 words 120 point MPhil thesis out for external examination with instructions for external examiners to examine it with resspect to acceptability as a 360 point 'doctoral thesis' or PhD.  This was so that externals would be required to say that in order for it to be acceptable as a doctoral thesis it would need changes to the substance, since it would need to be about doubled in length.  The Univeristy then re-enrolled me for more points in the MPhil and said if I did not pay additional fees and undergo additional labor I would never qualify to complete the MPhil.  They chose to employ award winning in house counsel to send me letters saying that I owed them more money else I would never complete the Degree.  Also to inform me that the University was giong to hold me under 'zero fees' indefinately until such time as externls signed off on completion of requirements for the degree.</p>

                                <p>They pulled Justice Toogood out of retirement to hear my case against Waikato.  I claimed specifically they were not properly handling applications to enrol, progressions through training (refusing to get the thesis to examiners, sending it to be examined for the wrong degree).  They were refusing to acknowledge completion of graduate research work.  They were falsely invoicing the studnet loan scheme (for progarmmes of study I never even applied to) and presumably the government as well.  Justice Toogood didn't see anything wrong.  He thought it was his job to tell me that I 'hadn't done enoguh' to complete a 120 point qualification.  He refused to accept that the Tertiary Education Commission decides what 'right sized' means and they define 120 points as 1 academic year as being comprised of 34 weeks work which includes the external examination period.  </p>

                                <p>The New Zealand Vice Chancellors Committee has the statutory function of upholding quality and integrity of NZ University qualifications.  Chris Whelan in his capacity as VC of it has statutory responsibility or duty to hear whistleblower complaints.  The NZVCC has policy documents on how they will handle complaints of wrongdoing from both studnets and staff.  THey say that since I was not staff whisteleblower protections do not apply to me.  The NZVCC said in response to OIA request that they have only received 1 complaint of wrongdoing since CHris Whelan was appointed to office in 2014, I think it was.  That means to say he refuses to acknowledge that he has received any complaints.  Apparently he says that he hears a lot about people complaining about 'personal' or 'relationship' problems, particularly regarding graduate research studnets and various people on payroll to supervise them or get their work to externals, but none of them are accepted by him to be complaints of wrongdoing.  The Judge said that I did everything I needed to do to lodge a complalint of wrongdoing.  So I complained about wrongdoing in fact.  Regarding the University of Waikato keeping false enrolment records and false trnscripts (false enrolment records on the transcripts).  But since the NZVCC writes the NZVCC policy on how they will handle complaints, they don't have to follow the policy they wrote for them to follow because they can change the policy retrospectively. THeir policy stated they would forward the evidnce of wrongdoing to police for govenrment prosecution else have a meeting of the vice chancellors so they could remedy the situation in house preventing the need for prosecution and they do neither of those things.  Chris Whelan says in the name of privacy they throw away the complint and don't acknowledge it and the government will not prosecute wrongdoing within the University.  I have informed the police.  They told me it was a personal private matter for me.  It wasn't public intereset.  The government will not prosecute.  THey will hire a major firm to defend the NZVCC's entitlement to keep false studnet records and false transcripts.  To refuse to enrol.  To refuse to progress through training.</p>

                                <p>So you can see that there isn't an education system in NZ.  Not even trying.  They aren't even trying.  It isn't that they are just a bit sneaky and sly. I mean you catch them out red handed.  And their attitude is 'no no no no no no we refuse to do any of the things we are supposed to do (supplying applications to enrol, processing and progressing them on academic merits, allowing external examination of academic merits, acknowledging completion of all and only those who have met the external standards).  There's just nothing there.  Nobody home.  Not even trying to be.  No tertiary education sector at all. Not even trying to be.  Slave, prison, detention camps.  Up and down the land.  Not even trying.  </p>

                                <p>And the courts?  Well, they don't seem to  be trying, too.  Justices pulled out of retirement to be most unfair in the written judgments characterisation of the cases that I brought before the courts.  Justice Fitzgerald was fine, so far as she went, but she failed to provide teeth.  She did not instruct them to rescind their judgment that was ultra vires about my not being offered enrolment on grounds I was ineligible and replacing that with a judgment that was within the law.  What was my rank order score?  How many equity candidatees had been accepted?  That's enough to know whether or not I should have been offered enrolment.  Also compensatin.  It needs to be too costly to the University to do it wrong so there is financial incentive for them to do it right.  THey should bear the costs of their own inability or unwillingness to do their f*cking job.  </p>

                                <p>The other Justices seem pulled out of retirement to mischaracterise the case that I brought.  If Chris Whelan has the statutory function of upholdling quality and integrity by timely handling of complaints and there is a policy around in house sorting it out and then external prosecution if they won't...  And he is throwing the complaints away..  Then he needs to be removed from office.  He is not willing or able to do the statutory function for which he is on payroll.  He isn't doing the job at all.  What the hell.  Corruption.  Corrutpion, hey.  Is it legitimate to pull judges out of retirement?  What the hell?  Is the idea that it doesn't matter howmuch they mischaracterise the case and refuse to deliver a judgment in the interests of justice because..  What is anybody going to do about it?  Spend the next 100+ years trying to have them removed from office?  COrruption within the Judiary.  Not even trying to uphold justice.  What judiciary?</p>

                                <p>What health system?</p>

                                <p>The last thing Harlene Hayes did was...  Refuse to graduate 1/3rd the medical cohort, wasn't it?  THey had been signed off as having completed the workplace internships that the University of Otago had helped arrange for them to  be sent on.  The University refused to accept that they had been signed off.  I think (but I do not know) that they were then informed that they could go on to their junior doctor positions in the hospital. But, they would need to keep paying the Univerity money for continueed reenrolment and they would have graduation withheld.  So, then, they are passing themselves off as junior doctors in the hospitals, but they are not graduates of the Univeristy of Otago because the University refused to give them the qualifiction.  We were told that 1/3rd had their qualification withheld because of issues with overseas workplace internships. We werent' told how many had their qualifications withheld because of issues with local or domesetic workplace internships.  New Zealand does not appear to have an education and training system.  Relying on work outputs of people kept or held as bonded servants or slaves.</p>

                                <p>How much money do you think someone might pay to get to play doctors and nurses in the hospitals?  How much money would someone pay to, I don't know, get to artificially inseminate women who have been anesthetised for unrelated procedures or...  Do anything anything anyting in the hosptials of New Zealand?  </p>

                                <p>They aren't processing applications to enrol.  They aren't acknowelding progression through trianing.  They aren't supplying graduation to all and only people who have met requiremetns.  Corruption.  THere's nothing there.  They don't seem to be trying, at all.  They hire lwyers to defend their entitltement to refuse to process aplpicatons and so on.  </p>

                                <p>The Australian National University is also refusing to process applications to enrol, over the last few years, at any rate.  I applied so as to see how they would process my application.  They won't process it.  They say my application is incomplete and that is false.  </p>

                                <p>The Australian National University refuses to process student work.  I have over on the writing page a 100,000 + word document that I got to my supervisor and university administration and they won't get work to external examiners.  THey just won't do it.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  They just refuse to do it.  I complain to them and they just refuse to accept that I have complained.  THey say I need to revise and resubmit my complaint over and over and over and over and over.  Gaslighting.  I haven't actually lodged a complaint.  Didn't you know?  I haven't actually applied to be enrolled, I haven't actually done any work.  See all the work that I haven' done over on the writing page.  I must be a randomly generated robot or something.  What the f*ck????</p>

                                <p>I filed everything that needed to be filed for the above cases to progress through the court of appeal.  I filed everything  by the deadline.  In fact, I needed to file various appeals of the court of appeals judgment that none of the above cases were of any public interest at all.  Apparently they are all very very particular and personal to me.  The court of appeal informed me (in the knowledge that I was kept by the NZ government on 'Supported Living Payment' rather than wages that I was required to pay more than $20,000 to the court of appeal in order to progress the above cases.  Things were not held up in the court of appeal because I missed a filing deadline.  Things stopped because the court of appeal demanded that I pay them more than $20,000 'security for costs' on the grounds that the above are not matters of public interest.  This decision of the court of appeal was upheld by the supreme court who ordered additional costs to be paid my be for having filed an appeal with the supreme court on the grounds that the decision of the court of appeal was manifestly unjust.</p>

                                <p>I filed with Work and Income for advance benefit payment so I could pay the security for costs amount set by the courts.  They declined that.  I followed the appeals process for that.  I did not miss any filing deadlines.  The Ministry of Social Developmetn was granted extensions.  The case was heard by the social security tribunal in October.  They still have not delivered judgment on the case.  They say they have no plans to deliver a judgment.  They are overwhelmed, apparently, by all the filings they get. </p>

                                <p>Subsequent to my having recieved the supreme court judgment and the judgment from the benefit review committee I was informed that my mother passed away and some money was coming to me from that.  So, now, if I can pay the security for costs amount that was set by the court of appeal then what?  The court of appeal says the cases have been deemed abandoned.  I was out of time.  I did everything I was required to do by the deadline, various other parties did not do the things they were required to do.  They were given extensions.  They are given payroll.  They are given extensions and payroll.  They order me to file nd refile nd refile and cry cry cry about how they are overwhelmed with all of the filings they have required.</p>

                                <p>There isn't anything here at all.</p>

                                <p>There isn't any psychiatry or any medicine.  It's just a government institution of abuse.  Dr Leeks was revered as a mighty leader.  It wasn't that he was doing anything different from what anyone and everyone else is doing in the name of psychiatry.  Right?  It's hard to try and select for studnets who will not see anything wrong with this kind of thing, studnets who will be active participants.  There doesn't seem to be any indication that things are any different or that people with power want for things to be any different.  They aren't even trying to be fair at all.</p>

                                <p>Socrates said 'the unexamined life is not worth living'.  The univerisities think it is really really funny that they simply refuse to get studnets work out to examiners, refuse to fairly examine it on it's actual merits.  Instead they engage in 'personal' or 'personality' based selection on the basis of nepotism or whatever.  Who they like to party and travel with.  Who makes them feel good about themselves because they smooth their ego only and pander to them.  There's nothing here.  They aren't even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                                <p>I don't even know if it is true or not, but I thought I saw that Ashley Bloomfield had been appointed Professor at University of Auckland.  He isn't 'doctor' in virtue or PhD or MD, though.  I mean to say,  he hasn't applied to study for a research doctorate qualification, he hasn't done the independent work for one.  He hasn't graduated from a research doctoral degree. He isn't qualified to be Professor.  He has an MBChB which the world medical directory lists as an undergraduate level qualification and a...  One year Masters?  Two year Masters?  With a one year coursework and a one year research component?  I suppose being a Professor is an attractive prospect since the High Court has ruled tht you can, effectively, enrol whoever you want for whatever arbitrry reasons you want quite irrespective of whether they have even applied to the University.  You can take a gander at the photogrphs or whatever and record levels of debt against their name and indoctronate them into believing that it's soooooo competitive they must be willing to do anyting you say because you say for as long as you say.  Suck your d*ck on demand or anything anything anything.  Why aren't you regisered to practice Medicine in NZ Ashley?  That's what you are qualified to do -- right?  Or, they only acknowledge that qualification on the understanding that you aren't registered and you never work with patients.  Ayesha...  Shane Reti does the bare minimum to keep up his registration.  Correct?  So his patients can only see him for 1 or 3 weeks of the year, or similar.  NOthing here.  Nobody home.  People don't have healthcare because of politics.  Correct.  Also don't have education.  Also no judiciary.  How's Una Jagose doing?  Still throwing away evidence?  Ensuring that health records are kept insecurely so they can be destroyed or at the very least all be inadmissable as evidnece of the governments crimes against the people.  There' snothing here.  NOt even trying.</p>

                                <p>Do you think Ashley has the capacity to do a research qualification from an Australasian University?  What is involved in doing one?  He would have to get them to get his work out to the external examiners.  Why would they do that?  Why would they get his work out to external examiners?  Why wouldn't they just take his work and never ever ever ever ever sign him off?  Why wouldn't they just take his work and reattribute it to other people?  Then they can appoint as Professors all and only people who steal their studnets work and pass it off as their own.  Or who upload their studnets work to turnitin so that the undergrads of princeton can pass it off as their own.  Or the professors at princeton.  Why not appoint only people who are incapable of doing research and make them slavers of those with capacity.  Never sign off on anybodh with capacity.  Just keep them as slaves.  Theres nothing here.  They won't get the work to the examiners.  They won't allow the examiners to sign off on the studnets work.  Nothing here.  Nobody home.  Not even trying.  </p>

                                <p>We are supposed to believe Ashley Bloomfield has done enough for a Professorship.  He hasn't even done enough for a PhD or an MD.  He never even applied for the Professor job that he isn't even qualified for.  Right?  He was just told that that was where he was being re-deployed to next?  I mean, I don't supppose it is that his research output is any less than the research output of various other people who have been placed on University payroll. To ensure that the work outputs of those with capacity never go to externals.  </p>

                                <p>The most blatant case that I know of was Fiona MacPhearson taking my work on delusions.  She had powerpoint presentation handouts and maybe even access to the written versions of things that I've put on my writing page.  Then she wrote something on delusions and synasthesia that looked really rather a lot like she just took my work and incorporated it into her own and passed it off as hers without any acknowledgment or reference to me.  This was when she was on payroll with a University in Scotland.  I guess that set the tone for everybody else to just take whatever they wanted from me. I mean, what was I going to do about it?  If I complain I must be crazy.  Right?  If you write a thesis about psychiatry that makes you mentally ill.  If you write a thesis about disability that makes you lacking in capacity and if you write a thesis about yellow then, clearly you are yellow.  If you write about trees then I guess that makes you a tree.  There's only nonense.  Nonsense garbage garbage garbage.  There's no sense in how they treated me.  I didn't enjoy spending time with my frienemies.  I wonder why.</p>

                                <p>I saw something in the news to the effect that a medical student had been thrown out of Sydney University after he was pulled before the courts (for the second time) for beating his girlfriend.  I don't know if that was Hylands son or grandson, specifically.  Reynolds son was about the age of going off to Uniersity when Reynolds was made professor. It is a matter of public interest whether he used his position as Professor to expediate selection for his son on the grounds that his son is entitled (one can only suppose) to bypass academic merit based selection.  The Univeristy of Otago has stated that it uses 'alternative' or 'other' selection to select students into medicine who have never studied at Univerity level and some who have never been to polytech or done any tertiary education at all.  They say they are entitled to select whoever they want for whatever arbitrary reasons they want.  They are not even pretending to be a functioning university. </p>

                                <p>I don't want to do Medicine because of these people, because of people such as these.  Can't imagine much of anything worse than having to spend time with frienemies such as them.  The silly games they are playing.  Fact is that most people are not like this.  They expect better from our public servants.  They expect better from university selection process and accreditation programmes and so on.  They expect better when they ask for help from social services and from the hospitals.  They expect better when they apply to university.  They expect  better.  They do.  They really don't know that things are as corrupt as all this.  I think most people would be surprised to learn.  So, now the people understand why we don't have a health system, education system, functioning judiciary.  Because of people's selfishness when it comes to their children and their willingness to use their public position for their own selfish private advantage at the expense of everybody else.  It is true that it is not in the public interest at all.  What they are doing, I mean to say.  Which is something that is in the public interest to learn.  So they know what kind of psychopathic frenemies have taken over our schools and hospitals and universiteis etc.</p>

                                <p>Oh we cannot wait to see...  What Ashley-Bloomfield-Umbridge will decree...  Hem Hem.</p>

                                <p>It is just f*cking garbage of a waste f*cking dump of a waste f*cking land.  There does not appear to be any of the most basic of 'try' from the education system, the health system, the judiciary.  Certain people seem to feel entitled, in fact.  They take up all the training places, they don't follow the laws, they can't / won't make judgments on the basis of them.  There's just nobody home.  Nothing there.</p>

                                <p>During Covid Lockdown I presented to the ED of the Grafton hospital with a likely bacterial infection from a mechnical toe injury from walking too much during lockdown.  This was when they were saying that GPs didn't have enough PPE and the hospitals were not overwhelmed.  Rather, hardly anybody was turning up to them, because people were afraid of Covid.  So I put on my N95 mask and went to the ED.  I said I was also concerned about parasites since I'd been walking a lot in the Domain and was concerned about hookworm since I didn't know the sewerage outflow situation of the swampy ground, there.  So close to the hospital.</p>

                                <p>THey put me in a one person room with no windows and locked the door on me so I could not leave.  THey kept me there for more thn 12 hours.  Nobody had filled out any forms to authorise them to keep me for a psychiatric assessment.  But they refused to supply me with a phone so I could call a lawyer, they refused to supply me with a phone so that I could call the police and report my unlawful detention.  The room that I was placed in was not a suitable room to keep someone if you think they are mentally unwell therefore at risk of harming themself.  There were extensive cords from cardiac equipment.  There was a sharps bin that may  have contained sharps (I didn't check).  THey actually put me in the room with a line / a sharp in my arm.  That's how concerned about my safety they were (yeah, right).  After more than 12 hours they then filled out the paperwork that was needed to keep me for a 5 day observation period.  They then moved me into the most restrictive environment possible.  The most secure ward. </p>

                                <p>I was one of maybe two females on the mostly male ward.  There were no locks on the bedroom doors.  I was required to share single stall bathrooms with male patients.  They did not supply me with sanitary materials in a timely fashion.  They wrote in my notes actually that I was delusional for saying things about blood. </p>

                                <p>They took me into a single isolation, again, and said I was required to take what they claimed was a prescription medication (old generation antipsychotic) orally otherwise they would remove my pants and inject my backside.  FOrcibly.  THey had around 4 male staff who were going to do this.  They were standing around waiting for my 'decision' after having dragged me into seclusion.</p>

                                <p>THey then proceeded to hold me for 7 days.  They were only authorised to hold me for 5.  In the least restrictive environment.  Not the most.  The least.</p>

                                <p>I requested my file notes.  THey supplies scaps of notes here and there via time limited online access only.  I kept requesting, I kept requesting, I kept requesting.  I got sick and f*cking tired of it and initiated Judicial Review of Administrative Action requesting removal from office of the most senior people responsible with the courts.</p>

                                <p>To this day they have supplied no medication charts.  That means to say there is no evidence that a psychiatrist prescribed anything at all for me to take.  So, then, what did they force me to take?  What was it?  They said it was an old generation antipsychotc that had been prescribed for me,  but that was false.  What was it?  Was it LSD?  Was it Ketamine?  What was it? </p>

                                <p>The Auckland District Health Board chose to hire for themselves a Queens Counsel and instructed him to file to have my proceedings thrown out without a substantive hearing.  The Judge instructed for a 2 hour hearing of the matter to have the proceedings thrown out.  In that 2 hour hearing I supplied to the Judge the medical records that had  been supplied to me.  They document how I was detained for more than 12 hours without the necessary paperwork for keeping me in the hospital.  THey document how a phone and lawyer were not supplied to me.  THey document how there were no medication charts for me at all, no prescriptions, and yet they also document how I was taken into seclusion and required to take medication by mouth on threat of injection.  THey document how they continued to keep me for 2 days after the section lapsed.  The Psyhciatry notes say that I am to remain in the hospital on a voluntary basis even though I want to leave.  I am to stay as a volunteer.</p>

                                <p>The Judge said that I was to refile my filings.  That the proceedings were not to be struck out,  but I was to do more filings for the courts.  He refused to schedule a substantive hearing of what I had filed already.  He awarded more than $5,000 costs against me for having lost the application to have proceedings struck out (even though he did not strike the proceedings out).  This was all upheld by the supreme court.  </p>

                                <p>What psychiatry?  What health system?  What judiciary?  THere is nothing here.</p>

                                <p>Who was responsible?  One way of looking at it was that Ashley Bloomfield Umbridge was responsible for the hospitals  being under-staffed.  For not employing actual psychiatrists to work in the hospitals.  What's that Ashley, there aren't any?  Because they wont' publically advertise the jobs.  BEcause they throw teh applications to work there away.  SO that they can make you Professor of the University, now.  </p>

                                <p>Yet another year of wrongly decided people who are supposed to wrongful deathbring and murder and sexually violate and bully and abuse and oppress...  Yet another year.  Yet another year.  They are supposed to do important medical research?  They refuse to calculate a GPA ffs.  Nobody home.  Completely and utterly lacking in the most basic honesty and integrity.</p>

                                <p>They used to kill people with mercury.  They would prescribe it as a treatment for syphilis.  If the syphilis didn't kill you then the mercury would.  Cancer treatments can be that, as well.  People confuse the toxic side effects of the medciation with the condition that was the reason for them to start taking the medication.  Screening tests that themseves promote if not overtly cause the cancers they are screening for.  </p>

                                <p>Why would you think that the health system would be about health anymore than the justice system would be about justice anymore than the education system would be about education?  There's nobody home.  Nothing here.  The government broke the social contract in fact.  The people who have hijacked the social services holding everyone to hostage while they use public resources and so on for their own selifish private advantage to the ruin of us all.</p>

                                <p>So, while I'm being involuntarily detained in a seclusion cell I'm wondering why...  I mean, is the idea that since people aren't presenting to the hospital they really need to keep anybody who does (to keep the beds fill since they probably get more money for having the beds filled).  I wonder if the room I am being kept in specifically is cardiology so they get more money from cardiology for keeping me in that room.  I think about how we keep hearing about various people who ask for help and various families who ask for help.  How they don't get the help they need because the health system is too busy involuntarily detaining under conditions the UN has declared amount to torture in fact various people who don't want to be there.  Claiming they are 'volunteers' who are there 'voluntarily'.  You don't need to post security outside and keep locks on the doors of the ward to prohibit people from leaving when they are there voluntarily.  It isn't a hospital, is it.  No.  It is something different entirely.  It is most concerning when we hear that students are raped in their university residential halls, detained in the name of psychiatry, then deported without their qualifications.  It is concerning to hear Auckland manufacturing LSD when the hospital refuses to keep accurate medical records.  It isn't a hospital.  And it doesn't appear to be a university, either.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  The Judiciary refuses to function.  I suppose because they couldn't / wouldn't process applications to and completions from law either.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.</p>

                                <p>I have written to the Minister of Justice and asked the Ministry to remind the Social Security Tribunal of Government expectations on the timliness on delivery of judgments.  THis is not the same as asking for political pressure to affect the CONTENT of the judgment.  Can you hear the difference.  The Ministry of Justice refuses to acknowledge receipt of my complaint.</p>

                                <p>No indication of the slightest little hint of 'try'.  All of they payroll for them.  So they can say that they are too busy being sick and too busy being off on holiday to do their f*cking job.  Why didn't the ANU get my work out to external examiners when it was time for that to be done?  The external examiners are meant to decide whether the studnet had done enough or not and what changes may need to be made for the student to then be signed off. And they simply refuse.  THey will not do it.  ALl of these people on payroll who refuse to do their job.  All of the payroll for them.  All of the payroll for them.  All of the payroll for them to keep slaves.</p>

                                <p>Justice Toogood did  not see anything wrong with the University of Waikato refusing to enrol me in the programme I applied to when I applied by the published application deadline and I was eligible to be enrolled in the programme and the programme was not oversubscribed since I was the only applicant for it.  He didn't see anything wrong with the Univesrity invoicing my studnet loan and the government for claiming to have enrolled me in courses of study that aren't listed in the University Calendar, even.  Then them refusing to get my work to external examiners, repeatedly.  Refusing to accept that I had submitted work for external examination.  What could 'keeping false records' (of enrolment) possibly mean?  If it doesn't mean claiming to have enrolled students in qualifications the studnets never applied to.  Claiming to be supervising students and then refusing to get their work out to externals to prevent and prohibit externals from signing off on completion fo the qualification?  The Government refuses to arrange for prosecution of the Univesrity keeping false enrolment records.  Claiming on my university transcript to have failed me for progarmmes of study that I never even applied to be enrolled in.  Claiming on my Inland Revenue Department account that I owe them money for programmes of study I never applied to be enrolled in.</p>

                                <p>Not even trying.  Hey.  Not even trying a little bit.</p>

                                <p>With 'friends' like these...  With Professionals like these appointed to most lucrative paid government payroll positions...  With people like Andrea Howard having been re-deployed to refuse to process applications for humane ways of dealing with the possum problem.  Redeploying Peter Crampton to the Southern District Health Board so he can ensure that only the Junior Doctors behind the Professor Glue Factory giving ketamine to teenagers and killing them off when they won't shut up about the crimes of various officials...  Dr Leeks 2.0...  I suppose that's the real push to enrolling people's children.  Did Dr Leeks have children?  Were they expediated into Medicine because (the ideology was) they would be most likely to continue on his crimes?  Was that the basic ideology?  </p>

                                <p>Didn't these Justices pulled out of retirement for the occasion leave sons or grandsons or great grandsons to ignore half the laws, make false claims about evidence, ignore half the evidence.  Do everything they can to obstruct and prevent and prohbit justice?  Where are there children?  Expediated into Law, probably - right?  Or expediated into Medicine?  So they can tell the judges that they want to keep this one or that one heavily drugged in a psychiatric hospital and it isn't in their 'patients' interest for their patient to have a fair trial or appear before the court or not appear in a sufficient drugged state etc.  Not 'healthcare'.  Not 'justice'.  There doesn't appear to be anything here at all...  Not even trying.  Not even the slightest f*cking hint of f*cking 'try'.</p>

                                <p>We are supposed to believe that all the NZ medical graduates are employed in Australia.  But that is not plausible.  What happens is that they say 'you are require to pass yourself off as junior doctor while you pay the univerity you pay the university you pay the university you pay the university'.  Then, when you are done paying the university you are imprisoned.  That seems to be what NZ likes to do, now.  When it is time to graduate studnets from training (and pay them for doing the job) it is time for the student to be vanished.  Imprisoned.  That's a great idea.  Make an impossible degree programme.  Maybe get the students writing 'I did seek external tuition to study for the UMAT' so that you can feel justified refusing to pay them because they lack the willingness or ability to follow the most basic of instructions.  Maybe get the studnets documenting their crimes in the ethics class.  Writing up about how they have been sexually violating patients performing 'unauthorised cervical exams' shall we call them without the patients consent.  Select for all and only those students so we don't have to feel bad about marching them off to prison or death camps or whatever when it is time to graduate them from their training programme and pay them.  And pay them and pay them.  To put the students to work pay the university pay the university pay the university.  Then it's time for you to die. They broke the social contract.  There is nothing here.  Nobody home.  Australia pretends to be too f*cking stupid to be able to parse it's own f*cking constitution ffs.  Not even trying to be rule by law at all.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  Not even trying.  Not even a tiny little bit of 'try'.   </p>

                                <p>How long can it possibly take for the Social Security Tribunal to declare that they don't see anything wrong with the Government refusing to process applications for training or employment, refusing to enrol or employ the people with the relevant academic merits and experience and qualifications, them choosing to hold people on less than minimum wage government welfare so that the courts can claim that it's all very very peresonal anad particular against that individual, not a matter of public interest at all, and refuse to process or progress filings complalining about the government keeping false records.  Refusing ot process applications for training.  Refusing to do any of the things that government is supposed to do.  There's nothing here.  Nobody home.  NOt even trying to be rule  by law.  The people employed don't seem to have the willingess or ability or..  Capaciaty..  Training?  THey don't seem capable or competent to even understand what any of it means.   No speak the English.  Just open their mouths and f*cking garbage falls out.  Just f*cking garbage.</p>

                                <p>Hey InJustice Toogood.  How much they pay you to not see anyting wrong with the deaths of Mason Pendrous and Olivia Podmore?  To not see anything wrong with the University of Waikato refusing to do any of the most basic of things that it's supposed to do with respect to keeping accurate graduate student enrolment records and getting theses to external examiners?  HOw much do they pay you?  ANd how was it that you came to be appointed to office, anyway?  You were retired..  And then you were offered a job as High Court Judge.  Is there some kind or sort of process for that is there?  Or did they re-write the laws especially for you?  Did they re-write the laws saying that it was okay to employ retired people as Judges before or after you were appointed as Judge?  I'm just curiosu whether you think you are required to follow the laws or whether you think that you are God so that the laws should all be rewritten around you?  For how long are you supposed to sign you pawprint on things claiming to be judgements of the courts?  For the next 100 years?  When are you going to die, InJustice Toogood?  Christ...  When do you plan on dying, already?  How many years of government payroll have you had, already?  HOw many years of governmetn payroll for you?  Are you that f*cking broke that you need to be employed now?  You weren't able to train any studnets over however many years to do whatever it is that you do?  God.  I hope not.  Time to get out of the f*cking way I would have thought...  Let somebody competent come through...  Well, it's obvoiusly in the Bag with Justice toogood.  ALl of the money and all of the bags.  All of the everything for f*cking you.  WHat a f*cking joke.  If you were competent I wouldn't need to cast about for a reason why you are in the position you are in when you are obvously and clearly not competent.  What could 'keeping false records' possibly meeeeeeean?  How long did it take you to do your 2 year Masters in law at Yale, Justice Toogood?  4 years?  Longer?  How can you possibly be too stupid to understand that a 1 year masters should be completable in 1 year.  There are 2  year masters programmes..  Of course.  Usually comprised of 1 year of (roughly honors level) course work.  Then a 1 year thesis.  What's that?  A 1 year thesis.  Did you write your own 1 year thesis at Yale Justice Toogood?  Or did someone give you the work outputs of someone else to pass off as your own?  DId it seem to you that your supervisor wrote it for yuo?  WHo writes your judgments for you?</p>

                                <p>Who paid for you to go to Yale for a 2 year Masters in Legal Studies?  Was that a New Zealand Government initiative?  The taxpayers paid for you to go to Yale and get used to having Judgments given to you by various people over there.  Was that the idea?  I guess Yale and Harvard probably gets students to write the Judgments for the third world nations.  The ones that can't / won't send them anybody with the actual capacity to do the thing.  They can just go and be given things from others and pass those off as their own.  I don't imagine or suppose that you write your own Judgments, InJustice Toogood.  You don't hear so well.  There are none so blind as those who will not see.  Not even trying to uphold Justice or Fairness.  Do you even have the capacity to apprehend such things?  That is your legacy.  Well done.  The prevention and prohibition of justice.  The promulgation of injustice.  Well done, you.  Well done.  I guess Ashley can find 40 virgins to your liking and meet you someplace for 'better do this if you want to be signed off as having completed your qualification' (and then haha fooled you just kidding) 'degree' programme.  Yeah, right...</p>

                                <p>It is very informative to see the High Court at Auckland so unattended.  I mean to say the Law studnets don't even bother to attend court days.  There isn't any point.  It isn't like they can learn to be better lawyers by watching the InJustices or Lawyers in action.  They would only be exposed to just how corrupt the courts are.  Seeing how the Judges refuse to listen to what is being said (e.g, the issue being the legal issue of the legal term 'eligible').  Seeing how the judges bully and abuse people.  Basically.  Effectively.  We dont' appear ot have a functioning law system at all.  Prosecution is incompetent.  I suppose because some people's kids think that it sounds like a sexy cool job so they put those kids on the payroll.  But they aren't actually competent to prosecute anything at all. But even if they were, it wouldn't matter, because none of the evidence is admissible.  THey wouldn'dt have said they graduated from police training college if they didn't learn all about how they are supposed to ensure that the evidence is inadmissable.  Then they can simply bully the person they find most bully-able and scapegoat them.  Instead of having a legal system.  We can just do that.  Find the person who seems most bully-able and scapegoat them.  There's really nothign here...  I don't see anybody really trying to do any different.</p>

                                <p>Guffaw guffaw guffaw.  How do we get her to become a terrorist.  Else kill herself already?  Front row with popcorn.  I'm sure there are many incompetent inbreds who are watchign in rapt awe..  It isn't like they are interested in anything else..  It is their entitlement.  Of course.  Might is right.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/new-crown-solicitor-for-auckland-announced/QOZVTDM6PVBHPMZXN6IVRAJHXY/  Meredith Connell Receptionists say that Meredith Connell can't prosecute this, that, and the other thing, because the government department has put a dollar in their pocket already since Meredith Connell is private also public.  So the government can put a dollar into the private Meredith Connell so that the Public Meredith Connell can't prosecute the government for corruption.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.</p>

                                <p>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-64495673  But there aren't any jobs for you.  People in your parents generation and your grandparents generation thought that they wanted more than 40 years of government payroll for themselves so you lot need to go off to death camps, already.  No jobs for you.  All of the money for them.  So they can have multiple houses and keep harems of slaves.</p>

                                <p>Hi Sterelny!!!! Hi!!!! Hi!!!! have you sent my thesis out for external examination yet?  Any comments for me, then?  What changes should I make before it gets sent out?  Have you managed to get out your pen yet to start work.  You are paid to supervise me.  No?  You are on payroll to supervise me.  What work have you done, then?  Any comments for me?  When shall I meet with you?  ANy plans to read my work?  Hi!!!! Hello!!!! Anybody home???  F*cking psychopath.  For f*cking real.  Hiiiiii Who wants to go driiiiinking...  Hey just look after my house for me, okay...  I'm too f*cking lazy to pay someone to do it.  Respect.  Basic f*cking professionalism.  Are you f*cking dead yet?  F*cking hell...  WOrse.  Supervisor.  Ever.  Nobody home ffs.</p>

                                <p>You have got these kids, right.  And their parents do EVERYTHING for them.  All the very very very very best of everything that money can buy.  THeir parents really go gunning for them.  They get all the very very very very best of everything.  The best of the housing.  The best of the teachers.  The best schools.  The very very best of everything.  Every opportunity.  But still...  But still they can't get a place on the basis of their academic merits.  You have to engage in corrupt practices to throw various other applications away because your f*cking precious children are that f*cking stupid that they just can't do it without your gunning for them.  Pulling out all the corruption things that you can do to cut everybody else off at the knees.  Because depriving everybody else of housing and so on still wasn't enoguh.  Your kids are that f*ckign stupid.  Do you get it, yet?  Can you see??  That f*cking stupid.  Making hostages of us all.  Duh....  It's tooooo f*cking haaaard.  Wait for me.  DO it for me.  Just hand over all your stuff!!! Mine!!!! mememememe f*cking me.  I'm sooooo selfish..  Alllll of the f*ckign everything for me!!! Duuuuuh!!!! Buy me a place in Medicine Dadddy!!!!! I wanna go rape the aboriginals!!!  I'm too f*cking stupid to calculate a GPA!!! But I'm supposed to be working with Harvard to make a vaccine.  Yeah, right.  I'm too f*cking stupid to tell the difference between 'eligible' and 'entitled' when one (and only one of those terms) is in the education act.  I'm too f*cking stupid to focus on what is relevant for a judgment.  Too f*cking stupid to write a judgment.  That's why alllll of the law training places to me and my stupid f*cking friends so we can pat ourselves on the backs about how f*cking stupid we f*cking well are making everything worse for everyone every f*cking day.  NZ is in the Australian constitution as a state of Australia.  But everyone is too f*cking stupid to read english.  Too f*cking stupid.  It's like a f*ckign taser to the brain.  No point f*ckign speaking.  Nobody here.  NOthing home.  Overtaken by stupid.  Unbelievable.  Lobotomies all round.  No doubt.  Fixing up the nasal polyps.  Nobody here.  Not even trying.  Just nothing here at all.  What a f*cking joke.</p>

                                <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/483996/new-health-minister-at-odds-with-frontline-healthcare-workers-over-staff-shortages  Every year you get a new intake of junior doctors, that's right.  And the last thing that Harlene Hayes did (before she was redeployed from Otago to Western Australia) was put the 'students' to 'work' in the hospitals passing themsleves off as Junior Doctors while they paid the university, they paid the university, they paid the university, while their graduation was withheld becuase the university refused to acknowledge they had completed the requirements of the qualification because it refused to accept they had  been signed off as having completed the internships the university had sent them on.  No surprises that they want foreign (and domestic) students to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the university and pay and pay and pay to sit 'examinations'.  Probably examinations where a few people sit around and throw away the examination scripts so the actual paid positions (and the training accreditation) can go to the rapist murdering children of the administration only.  THe kids it was always going to go to.  Quite irrespective or regardless of the actual knowledge or ability of the candidates.   Nothing at all to do with luck.  If it was luck it would be a mirror on society.  How society actually is.  But they are trying to socially engineer society so that it looks like the outputs of their f*cking medical doctor breeding programme.  NOt even trying even a teeny tiny little bit.  Can't / won't process the applications. </p>

                                <p>I mean..   Socially engineering New Zealand to look like Peter Crampton in the name of equity.  Yikes.</p>

                                <p>They are right that the way they are going about it is not a 'sustainable' or 'long term' solution.  The Holocaust was supposed to be the 'final solution'.  I think that's what needs to happen, here?  Just bomb the crap out of it.  What alternative is there?  What alternative can there be?  When they would have us believe that 90 to 98 per cent of the 'people' in this region are criminal degenerates without a sense of morality.  Unwilling and unable to demonstrate basic levels of reading comprehension.  Unwilling and unable to process applications on merits.  Nepotism.  But not only or just nepotism...  If they can get their kids merit selection based overseas they will do that...  So it's just the worst of the criminal degeneate children of the inbreds who are expediated the all of the everything in these lands.</p>

                                <p>And of course it isn't that they are stupid.  I don't believe in stupid (as standardly conceived)  it is that their motivations, inclincations etc are different.  For example, they go to university to have morning tea and lunch and afternoon tea.  THey pat each other on the back telling each other how clever they are and take take take from others who they don't think are cool enough.  Or whatever.  People who don't seem to enjoy their company.  How am I supposed to enjoy their company when they aren't progressing my work?  They aren't doing tehir f*cking jobs?  I'm sure the judges are very very very popular in the whiskey bar and their social clubs.  Everybody wants to play golf with them etc etc.  Well, then, all of the everything for them then.  They are like the children who like to play games where they are over-powered.  Except it isn't a game and they are not children.  </p>

                                <p>I speak simply.  THat is ignored.  I speak simply.  That is ignored.  I explain more.  Still ignored.  I explain more.  Still ignored.  After a while I start producing something they think is garbeled.  Of course.  That's because they never were going to listen.  I can die or produce garbled garbage.  I wouldn't have needed to file ANYTHING AT ALL with the courts if the Univesrities had been able to see a problem and actually move to fix it.  I wouldn't have needed to put in any official requests for information.  Their f*cking stupidity makes so much stupid work for htem nd their f*cking stupid.  So they can say they have no plans to do the job for which they are paid (deliver timely judgmetents for example).  Well then allll of the everything for them.</p>
