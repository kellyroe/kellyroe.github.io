                            </p>

                            <p>I have provided clickable links to how I calculated my GPA.  The only reason I go on about my GPA is because they say that entry to Medicine is `highly selective' or `competitive' -- on the basis of GPA, primarily.  But they do not seem to be selecting candidates on the basis of their GPA when they proritise entry for teenagers (who haven't even completed 1 year of University study) or they prioritise adults (who have attained the age of 20 years) who, again, haven't even completed 1 year of University study.</p>

                            <p>Whether it is true or not I was informed that my Honours year papers (that I have supplied) were bundled with University of Auckland studnets and externally graded by someone from the University of Otago.  My MA was externally examined by Professor Grant Gillett.  To the best of my knowledge NONE of the ANU doctoral studnets had reports from external examiners.  NONE of the ANU doctoral students had publically scheduled oral examinations or defences.  The whole time I was living at University House and I don't remember any doctoral graduation events.  Did anybody actually graduate with their PhD from that institution?  How come various are payrolled for post-doctoral positions, then?  What is the value or worth of a PhD from an institution isn't even trying to be fair when it comes to which students they enrol and which studnets they graduate etc.  How many PhD's did the ANU enrol Carl Brusse for?  Why does he have to write 2 in order to get credit for 1?  Who got the credit for the first 1 that he wrote?  Someone from Princeton?  What are they doing now?  Collecting up payroll, somewhere, for being Professor, no doubt.  What institution is that with, then?  So we know the value of their programmes etc.  </p>
