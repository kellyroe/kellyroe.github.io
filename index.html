 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->

                            <article>

                                <p>Alright, so here's the story.  I am waiting on two things: </p> 

                                <p>(1)  The Australian National University.  They are locating my student records and saying something about why I left the ANU without recieving credit for a PhD.  I found this <a href="judicial-review/anu-enrolment.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Records </a>.  I suppose they can locate whose job it was to tell me when I needed to get my work to externals so as to complete the qualification in the 'minimum, normal, or standard time'.  They told me that my enrolment would be on hold for 1 year when I went to the USA.  They did not tell me that they would enrol me 'part time'.  Hahahahhahhahahahaha they stopped me completing the Degree in the 'minimum normal or standard time!'  Wow!!! They are sooooooo clever!!!! Hahahahaha more fool me!!! Take that amount of time away from net worth on my life-time earnings!!  Gosh I'm a stupid sucker of a fool for realising that the 'study program' was nothing more than a 'detention camp'.  Maybe my supervisors job was to tell me when I needed to get them pieces of whatever length if they had time in their busy schedules to help me make my work better before their time budget was blown and it was time to see if I'd done enough for a PhD.  Or maybe their main aim or goal or purpose or point was to eliminate me.  
                                </p>  

                                <p>(2)  The social security tribunal of New Zealand.  The New Zealand government chooses to keep me on less than minimum wage.  My applications for work are not progressed (positions will remain vacant and readvertised rather than employing me), I am not shoulder-tapped for work (as is customary).  My applications, work submitted for examination, course completions are not handled properly by New Zealand Tertiary Providers.  The courts won't progress my filings after justice was repeatedly denied to me in the High Court.  The social security tribunal of New Zealand believes that New Zealanders kept on welfare cannot have advance benefit payment to pay security for costs that the Supreme Court requires people kept on welfare to pay to have cases heard in the court of appeal when justice was denied to them in the High Court.  
                                </p>

                                <p>I am aware that they think they can get free labor / free 'work' out of the things that I post to the internet so that stops.  Who profits?  Do the people in the USA like it when I spend my life documenting the crimes of the NZ government?  That's a good slave job for Kelly!!!!!  Document their crimes.  Document their crimes.  Document their crimes.  Shame we can't have health and education.  Document their crimes.  Document their crimes.  Document their crimes. The people don't have healthcare because they won't enrol, progress, graduate people, publically advertise jobs, employ people, pay people.  Just won't do it.  Nope.  Nothing to see here, people.  Sorry..  All your work was for nothing.  Pay ya later. 
                                </p>

                            <p>
                            The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications.  They define a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  
                            <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a> 
                            </p>

                            <p>Here is how much the Inland Revenue says I owe the New Zealand Government for my 'Education' and 'Training': 
  
                            <a href="judicial-review/ird-shot.pdf" target="_self"> $104,663.</a>

                            They have not provided a break-down of what courses they recorded me as having been enrolled in, in what year.  I have transcripts for some years that I will upload.  They acknowledge that I have completed BA(hons) and an MA (I can't tell whether they invoiced 1 year or 2 years or more of fees total for the MA - it looks to me from my transcript that they may have double-billed).  They refuse to acknowledge that I have completed anything since then.  They keep invoicing my student loan -- for courses that I never applied to be enrolled in (changing enrolment dates for more billings for them which make me look like I'm slow).  They take my research work, particularly, and give it to third parties without crediting me (or paying me).  They can't hire anybody to write anything on the UNDRIP in a timely fashion.  Nobody with that capacity lives or works, here.  The Governmetn won't allow anybody to work that job.  If it isn't worked by a slave...  There's some work free men won't do...  Well then.  Lie flat.  Play dead.  Die.   
                            </p>

                            <p>This is particularly clear with the 'Disability and Equity for Medicine and Public Health' thesis that I wrote.  I only wrote it because they said that writing it would be enough for them to consider my application on it's merits (GPA, interview score, UMAT/UCAT score) for Medicine with Auckland.  They took my thesis and used it for their own ends and they refuse to acknowledge that I wrote it.  And they refuse to progress my application to Medicine.  We don't have a health system.  We don't have an education and training system.  There's nothing here.  It's a detention camp is all.  There's nothing here.  The courts don't / won't / can't function.  There's nothing here.
                            </p>

                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  They aren't progressing the filings. 
                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  
                                </p> 

                            <p>
                            It seems to me that the Australian Constition explicitly states that New Zealand is regarded, by them, to be a State of the Federation of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  Australia refuses to honor it's own Constitution.  New Zealand seems to function as a detention camp of Australia only.
