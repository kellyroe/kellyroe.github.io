 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>I started this website so that I could self-publish some of the writing that I have done, over the years.</p>
                                
                                <p>
                                Mostly in the context of other people refusing to sign off on my higher research work - while also refusing to get my higher research work to external examiners, so as to prevent them signing off on my work, too. 
                                </p> 

                                <p>I put various pieces of writing here so that they are less likely to turn up in someone else's work.  Or, if that happens, it may be more readily identified as plagarism.  That is to say I put things up here to make it less likely that people delay me (to eventually fail me out) in order to expediate my work through - via someone else.  Also to make it less likely that people will think that by failing me they will silence me.</p>

                                <p>I also started this website in order to document what is happening with me in the courts of New Zealand.  The University's of New Zealand instructed me to take them to Court if I did not like how they were treating me.  I put the cases up here so that the international community can see how New Zealand Universities treat their Graduate Research Students.  Also their first and second year studnets when it comes to entry to 'competitive' degree programmes where people are very invested in giving those places to their own children at the expense of everyone else.</p>

                                <p>If you have to work on a 1 EFT qualification for 12 months before submitting for external examination, external examination takes at least 3 months, you have to be enrolled when you submit your thesis in fulfilment of regualtions for the Degree, than a 1 EFT 12 months qualification will take at least 15 months to complete.  That is 15 months of fees to be paid, then?  How many years of fees to be paid out the end of a 3 year PhD?  Or is it a 4 year PhD?  4 years before 'first examination', then?  If you don't comply with demands to 'keep working' where that work is accompanied by additional fees for the University then you are supposed to do...  What? Leave without your qualification?  Take them to court?</p>

                                <p>Then for how many years do you work for the courts?  Without pay?  Do you need to pay a lawyer else you can never win costs?  Is there any precedent for self-represented applicants to win costs?  How about compensation for their time?  Are they, then, to be kept as slaves to the courts?  How much do they need to pay the courts for the cases to be heard?  Can you obtain justice from the courts without paying the courts?  Are the courts, effectively, pay-to-win?  Is that how things are, in the Universities?  If I pay the pay-to-win tutoring services, is that how it works?  Or do I pay in alumini donations so that my work can go to externals?</p>

                                <p>Would you like to do business with New Zealand?  We have very high rates of child abuse, here.  We have very high rates of suicide, here.  We don't know what 'informed consent' means, here.  We believe in mob rule and sacrificing the individual for the team.  The case of the lonesome stranger showed much of the world that utilitarianism was inadequate as a moral theory.  The case of the lonesome stranger is interpreted, in these parts, as a reductio of morality.  I don't mean we temporarily lost the plot during Covid Times.  We either lost the plot well before Covid Times or we were never with the plot, at all.</p>

                                <p>I wrote my MPhil Thesis in 2018.  Before Covid.  I talked about how Medicine (as in being a Physician) doesn't make sense in a competitive environment.  It doesn't make sense to think of helping the disabled or incapacitated or sick or vulnerable when the very point of competition is to disable, incapacitate, sicken, weaken etc.  Psychiatry doesn't make sense in a context where you call people mentally ill in an attempt to undermine, ostracise, and discredit them.  Recently the leader of the opposition was discredited as leader on grounds that he seemed to be suffering from anxiety. </p>

                                <p>  
                                The point of psychiatry in NZ appears to be to involuntarily detain and force medicate people who haven't broken any laws.  Perhaps the recent 'terrorism laws' will free Psychiatry from that role so that Psychiatry is possible after all.  I don't know.</p>

                                <p>I don't know how much people pay to have their darling little murderers and rapists selected to murder and rape with impunity in the 'hospitals' of New Zealand.  The great lengths that are gone to to close ranks about the likes of Dr Green and Dr Leeks.  All the money and time and effort the New Zealand Government chooses to invest in closing ranks about the likes of Dr Green and Dr Leeks.  It is important to remember what it is all about, really, at the end of the day.  Closing ranks about the likes of Dr Green and Dr Leeks.  To enable them (and people like them) to keep doing the kinds of things they do.  In other words, selling out the health of New Zealanders.</p>
