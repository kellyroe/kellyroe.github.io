                            <p>Note that the USA and China are not doing business in this judisdiction, anymore.  New Zealand is closed, for business.  Our politicians and business leaders are required to travel overseas to sign contracts in foreign jurisdictions.  Better start training up  your legal defense to be heard in foreign jurisdictions, then.  Since you will be accountable to them and their military, one can only suppose.  No more pulling judges out of retirement to claim to receive evidence that was never supplied and to refuse to accept evidence that was supplied.  But you'll never be extradited to stand trial, you think?  Turn this whole state of Australia into New Manus Island detention camp prison facility.  Don't worry, Ayesha is trying to motivate and inspire a  new lot of people to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the 'Universities' for the honor of getting to kill patients in the vague hope that if they start killing patients nobody will talk to them.  What do you have to do to get them to shut up their face-holes?  It is like the people responsible for all the delays in the abuse in state care inquiry are paid by the amount of time that they take, or something.  Alllllll the extensions for them, therefore.  The compulsory extensions for them.  More and more and more time to make things worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.  Why don't  you practice Medicine, Ayesha?  They gave you a training place and they say that you graduated.  Why don't you do your job, then?  When did Ashley Bloomfield last see a patient?  What happened last time he killed a patient, then?  It's soooooooooo competitive.  It's soooooooo competitive!!!  It's soooooo competitive not everybody gets to do it, nobody gets to do it, there's nothing there.  It's sooooooooooooo competitive!!!!!</p>
