In intellectually handicapped nobody can read write or do arithmetic  -land...  There is no alternative.  yeah, right. I'm sooooooo happy and proud to be a NZlerndar.

                             </p>

                             <p>What Would Jacinda Do?  OMG.  Good choosing, you.  F*cking LMFAO.  Good job you.  Good choosing.  Everything it is that you value.  Yay you.  Your legacy.  Etc...</p>

                             <p>Pretty funny haha that the Massey Academics want to say that if they lose their jobs their graduate students will suffer.  Why would their graduate students suffer?  The graduate students are supposed to be working independently.  Tell you what, if the people payrolled to supervise aren't being helpful, aren't getting the students work out to external examiners in a timely fashion etc etc...  Then maybe it really is time for the people on payroll to supervise...  To be let go.  They don't seem willing or able to do the job for which they are paid.  If they aren't going to be helpful then get out the f*cking way.  Hey.  </p>

                             <p>The thing about them treating international students as cash cows...  It's not just about international students.  It's about domestic students, too.  The farming of people.  That was Stuart McCutcheon's ideology.  Wasn't it?  That was why he was appointed to position as head of NZ's supposedly premier University.  Because he had attributed to him a doctoral thesis about how the farmers cry cry cry cry cry for more and more and more government handouts every winter they won't feed the lambs they'll die in the winter cold every year without more and more and more money.  The unbridled greed.  The business model.  Very...  Silence of the Lambs.  Wouldn't you say?  Where is the research output?  Where is all the independent graduate student research?  The 1 year theses?  The 2 year doctoral theses...  When are the public oral examinations scheduled?  So that interested members of the public can go along and see the oral examination of the doctoral candidates?  What university ffs?  There's nothing there.  What a f*cking face of a joke of a f*cking hoax of a f*cking scummy scam.  What 'University'?  There's nothing there.</p>

                             <p>We are seriously supposed to think that the anti-intellectual governments of NZL...  The...  Relatively most un-educated government in the western world...  Our un-intellectual government...  We are supposed to think that Jacinda Arden is a shining model of intellectualism, now?  Because she got given an honorary degree for reading teleprompts?  She gets 3 fellowships from Harvard for a book she's going to write (and not a book she's already written) when she never even applied for fellowships from Harvard and she never did a 4th year at University...  It just defies credibility, hey.  What a f*cking farce of a joke of a hoax of a f*cking scummy scam.</p>

                             <p>Basically...  People won't share.  Only over our dead bodies.  Well, then.  The choices that they've made.  Something about doing unto others as you'd have them do unto you.  Well then.  You see how they've chosen for themselves to be treated.  Let them gnaw each others arms off.    F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                             <p>I have a great idea for maximising the amount of unhappiness in the world.  Want to hear it?  Of course you do.  What could be a more admirable goal?  It goes like this...  You tell everybody that there is one and only one goal or point or purpose or aim in life.  Everybody is just fighting over one thing.  The same thing.  Everybody wants the same thing.  But not everybody can have the thing.  In fact nobody can have it.  There isn't anything there in fact.  It was just an elaborate ideology created to maximise the amount of suffering and pain and sickness and disease...  Just busy trying to be God.  All of the power and none of the responsibility.  Wasn't me.  Contracted out to the singularity.  The computer programme was the only thing that gave me the outputs or answers that I would accept.  I went with the one that gave me only the outputs or answers I would accept.  That was clearly the best one.  But when it comes time for responsibility for the one I picked, well, then, wasn't me.  Must have  been the singularity that did it.
                            </p>

                            <p>How much money did the NZ governmetn spend over how many years on...  Shortland Street?  Seriously..  How much money went into creating a television show to be exported around the world..  A marketing campaign.  An educational promotion...  To accompany 'wah wah wah we don't have any doctors.  Aw..  Pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for a visa to come to NZ because we don't have any doctors'.  How much money did NZ choose to invest in Shortland Street?  I suppose they would have done it because they didn't have a better idea of how to make money.  THey thought they would make money off of foreigners paying and paying and paying to come here and become doctors or nurses or whatever...  I suppose.  We thought that it would be a good use of arts funding.  To create a medical show about a...  About the Aucklaknd City Hospital?  About Middlemore?  About a private hospital?  Was it?  About who wants to be a doctor and the role they have and the power and so on...  Who wants to be a healthcare administrator...  About playing doctors and nurses...  And so on...  A creative output of NZL.</p>

                            <p>Was it?  It wasn't really...  Was it.  It was...  Purchased.  Wasn't it.  By some production company or whatever.  The idea of it.  Of NZL having that as a creative output.  It being about a private no public hospital and what it would do to lure people to the state of NZL.  It was an Australian...  Was it..  Grundy production?  OR similar.  They didn't want to do 'Home and Away' (about how everybody wants to be in state care in Australia uplifted from unhappy unhealty homes and raised in a trailor park)...  They specifically wanted to do a show about a hospital in NZL.</p>

                            <p>Why?  Well..  Dr Leeks don't grow on trees...  It takes a community to raise a child like that.  To grow up to do all the things he's revered for.  Everything it was that was valued.  He was worth moving to Melbourne and I don't know how much he was payrolled so that he could continue on with his crimes against the people of Melbourne.  It wasn't that they didn't know.  They picked him out because they did know.  They valued him as they knew him to be.  How...  Motivating.  And...  Inspiring.  Apparently.  Or similar.  Pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for a visa to move to NZL, everybody.  If you feel suitably motivated and inspired to become a Doctor.</p>

                            <p>Everybody else..  Well.  Nobody else applied.  Turns out.  Nobody else was able to get an application in!  Everybody else had their application thrown away!  He was the only game in town.  The only one of any value.  All heil Dr Leeks!  They should build a statue to his honor.  Only, they don't need to.  I mean, it's not like what he was doing was any different from what most everyone else on payroll was and is doing.  Right, Sterelny?  What's that you say?  We've been taken over  by over taken by psychoapths.  Yes.  Well, I guess you would know.   You being the only game in town, and all.  The only one they'd payroll.  To take all the philosophy curriculum out of the philosophy department so you can teach?  Do you?  Do you teach?  Or just take all of the research funding...  So you can reattribute authorship and control the narrative.  Oh, please, explain it to me.  How does it go?  The psychopaths have taken over.  We aren't any different from the f*cking apes.  Why shouldn't I just kill you right now?  Oh, because  you are young and cute with wide blinking eyes.  Unless you aren't.  In which case f*ck off and die then.  F*cking psychopaths.  What philosophy programme?  When do your students have their scheduled oral defences?  Did any of your studnets?  Did you have one?  Did you write your thesis or did Frank write it for you?  Is that why you don't want to talk about your supposed earlier works?  Because you never would have been given all the research funding if you actually wrote your own work.  Or something.  If you were actually working independently.  What education and training system?  There's nothing there ffs.  Nobody home.</p>

                            <p>I gave the ANU a document over 100,00 words in length.  I gave the document to my named supervisor, at the time, Kim Sterelny.  I left the acknowledgement section completely blank.  Because I couldn't think of what to say...  What to thank him for.  Thanks for expecting me to go away with various people on various camping trips.  Where you invite the to speak -- but you don't invite me to speak.  Thanks for expecting me to turn up to various other people's talks to show solidarity or whatever because whoever is not with us is against us...  But when I'm talking when did any of you show up for me?  WHen did you show up to my talks at conference?  Once.  I remember.  Relatively early on.  After you launch into a tirade about how I'm not to read from a script because those talks are always awful..  But you know what I have now? I have written f*cking scripts of my talks in the first year particularly (before you told me to stop writing my talks).  Thanks for all your help you f*cking psychopath.  You really helped my work be better.  Not.  I did better work before you arrived - 6 months late to start with the supervision.  The ANU regularly moved people when it was time for students to be signed off as having completed.  They would move the supervisor.  So that people who were employed by the University to supervise would abandon their studnets.  Which, the University and various people on payroll would say..  Meant the studnet needed to begin again.  In otehr words..  The supervisor would flee with their studnets work...  And their studnet would notn get credit for it.  Then the studnet would  be required to begin again under another supervisor.</p>

                            <p>WHen I first started at the ANU Dave Chalmers and Kim Sterelny were both my named supervisors.  The both of them.  YOu can see for yourself that I was working for Dave the first 6 months.  I gave a talk at the consciousness at the beach workshop or conference.  He never gave me written feedback on the talk (even though I provided it to him) and we never had a meeting about my thesis project or whaetver.  He wasn't really supervising me.  But that's okay.  Right?  I mean, doctoral studnets are supposed to be working independnetly. </p>

                            <p>But instead...  Dave sets himself up as head of one end of the table..  And Kim sets himself up as head of the other.  And the studnets are expected to flock to their master, or similar...  To choose.  To choose sides.  Because that's what being independent means.  It means having big wide blinky eyes and begging them not to kill you.  Not playing the choosing game is not an option, apparently.  Like the bit of the Bible where if you are luke warm God will spit you out.</p>

                            <p>But Dave left after I was there for a year or two, anyway.  So he wasn't going to sign me off..  Only there was a student from Otago who started a year later than me who I think Dave did sign off on.  Not sure who wrote his thesis on philosophy of Physics, or whatever.  I thought the studnet had  never studied physics at University...  Anyway...  Whatever.  And of course Martin left and wasn't acknowleldging any of the work I did for him or on his project etc.  And I think about how various others were treated...  Jonathan Shaffer.  How he treated Aisling during her mid-term.  He doesn't offer her any supervision she works indepnednently and gives her mid-term.  And he f*cking tears her a new one.  Senior professor of a field..  Just awful bullying just ripped everything apart.  Nobody else had much to say..  He was just an awful  horrible bully.  And then...  What?  After she works for however much longer on it changing it in ways he requires...  He leaves.  Takes up a position in teh US.  Which means she's been abandoned.  So she needs to start over?  Find a new supervisor to pander to for how many years?  Visa expired.  Time to get out the country...</p>

                            <p>F*cking psychopaths.  </p>

                            <p>ANd that's supposed to be Australia's premier research institution.  Yeah, right.  F*cking scummy scam, I tell you what.  Any research that comes out of there is in spite of and despite them and certainly not  because of them.  It's sooooo hostile and Sterelny (and various others) are selfish selifish selfish pricks.  That's for f*cking sure.  Hurry up and die you f*cking idiots.  There' snothing there.  Well done.  You ruined it, hey.  Well done Australia!  Leading the world in Arts and Science and Tech!  Or maybe nothing nothing nothing at alll.  Prison.  Slave.  Detention camp land.  Paying various people stupid amounts of money to ponce about as rock stars.  To bully and abuse.  What University?  F*cking idiots.  There's nothing there.  What a f*cking joke.</p>

                            <p>The scam works like this.  They tie the visa to the employer.  So, someone immigrates to be a doctor.  They pay and pay and pay for visa processing and so on.  Flights.  Temporary accommodation.  Etc.  Then they get stuffed around and turns out their employer won't pay them.  What employer am I talking about?  The Universties.  The Distict Health Boards.  The Government.  The NZ Governmetn that paid money to advertise and market that we need people from overseas to come here and take up payed employment..  Teaching.  Nursing.  Jobs.  Turns out we won't pay anybody to work those jobs.  We will lure people into paying and paying and paying the NZ governmetn for visa etc and once they've arrived here the employer their visa was tied to will defect on their offer of employment.  They'll  be expected to work as s volunteer or for free or whatever.  They'll be requied to breech or violate the visa conditions.  That's the real thing of it.  To force ciminality upon us all.  Everyone is a crimnal. The only people who would come here must  be criminals fleeing their overseas crimes.  So once they get here we feel entitled to treat them horribly.  But we also treat the locals horribly.  Most fo the time.  Much of the time.  Tell the locals that they can't do various things.  So we can re re re re advertise for more and more money from overseas investment.  </p>

                            <p>So international studnets are lured here.  Their parents are told that NZers don't value education.  The parents don't value it.  So if they come here and value it..  If their kid works just a little bit while the NZ kids are off doing things they value like playing rubgy or diddling each other in the change rooms -- then they can get the well paying jobs.  Teachers and nurses and doctors and lawyers and so on.  Because NZers don't value education.  They've  been told.  That's why the NZ kids aren't allowed to sit their exams.  Why the work isn't being handed over to externals to  be assessed on it's academic merits.  All the energy and effor that goes into the stabotage.  The elaborate f*cking hoax.</p>

                            <p>And they get here and realise, I suppose it dawns on them gradually...  How much they've  been set up.  They never will pay them.  They'll just lure ne migrants here.  Else breed new locals.  F*cking psychopaths.  I swear.  WHERE IS MY MONEY, HEY???  HELLO???  MY ACADEMIC QUALIFICATIONS...  FOR THE ACADEMIC WORK THAT I'VE DONE?  WHERE IS MY ORAL DEFENCE?  WHERE ARE THE 3 COPIES OF MY THEISIS I SUBMITTED 14 SEPTEMBER 2018?  YOU F*CKING STOLE THEM.  WHERE IS MY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY?</p>

                            <p>kim.com pays and pays and pays to not be extradited.  The NZ governmetn takes and takes and takes.  The courts do.  The filing fees etc.  They take his money and they confuse and obstruct and allow things to  be bloated..  Not even trying to have a functioning judiciary.</p>

                            <p>I guess things must be really really really bad in the US that things have to be kept so bad here.  So that people will be lured to move to NYC etc.  Lolz.  Last I heard they were lining up the body bags over there.  Not the very old or the very young.  But the people when it was time for them to pay them.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                            <p>That's why everybody wants to be a doctor or an engineer, I suppose.  So they can better figure how to take out infrastructure.  The keystone so they can take out the bridge or whatever.  Also to target particular individuals.  The thought of *helping* someone is just laughable.  Right?  That's the thing of the Vampire Masquarade lore..  The distance from humanity.  Or, in the lifetime of the individual the older they are the more distant they are from when they were very young.  Dependent.  Someone didn't kill them outright.  Gave them food and stuff so they grew up or straggled up in spite of and despite.  But the older you get the more distant you are from humanity.  SOmeone who helped you.  Why?  Why would anybody help you?  WHen did anybody help you?  Why would they help you?  Eh, Sterelny?  Why would you help anybody?  Why would anybody help you.  It's soooooo competitive!  I see why they pay and they pay and they pay and they pay and they pay and they pay you.  WHy they moved you from Wellington to Canberra for everything it is that they value.  Send Richard Joyce to Wellington for everything it is that they value.  How many of his studnets has he slept with over the years?  I'm wondering...  What that his modus operandi?  Sleep with his doctoral students and then bully them into fleeing.  They can hand over their work for however many years and then feel so disgusting about the whole thing...  That's NZ's main way of people management.  Isn't it?  Isn't that a common theme for NZ?</p>

                            <p>What do you say, Chris Whelan?  All of the complaints that you have from graduate studnets complaining about what it is like studying with NZ Universities..  All fo the complaints that you receive.  Where you say that all of the complaints are personal problems between the studnet and the supervisor and none of them are to be upheld.  Rather, the studnet is required to flee.  Basically.  Right?  SO I guess you probably get lots of compliants from students regarding senior people cooercing them into sexual relationships etc etc only to find that the supervisors will then be all disgusted by the studnets research output.. . That's the theme -- right?  Read Carolyn Mason's second report of my masters thesis.  She would be embarrassed if anybody were to know that she passed it.  That's what she said.  She was embarrassed to be associated with the thesis.  She's embarrassed.  Is anybody else embarrassed that Canterbury University was okay about an employee of their saying such things in an examiners report?  The externals are supposed to be anonymous.  They are.  But they kept my intellectual property.  And the University of Waikato made the information as to who my external examienrs were available to me (maybe accidentally or maybe they were intentionally sh*t stirring) on my student portal.  SO I know who is responsible for the NZ external reports.  She's trying to bully me into feeling shame and walking away from the research output.  The one she kept.  Where is my thesis September 14, 2018 that was shipped to you for hte purposes of external examination only, Caroline Mason?  What did you do with it?  Where is it?  You say you didn't shred it - or you would have remembered.  You kept it.  You f*cking psychopath.  You don't deserve to have studnets.  You shouldn't be allowed around children.  You shouldn't be placed in positions of repsonsibility.  What's that you say?  Take the sperm and take the eggs and raise the infants in incubators.  That's a great idea, Carolyn.  Take sperm and eggs without consent.  Take organs without consent.  Raise infants who are property of..  Of who?  Of you?  The University?  The NZ Govermetn?  And then just take and take and take and take and take.  Just take f*cking everythign for you.  You selfish f*cking b*tch.  It would have f*cking killed you to have requested an oral defence.  WTF.  It was a 120 point masters thesis ONLY that you were sent.  I know the Uni gave you templates to write 'doctoral reports' of it.  Now..  Were you paid to write 'doctoral reports' or were you paid to write 'masters reports'.  What token amount were you paid?  Because the amounts are different.  As is the invoice to the governmetn.  I'm sure.  For the false billings the 'Universities' are doing.</p>

                            <p>Because the truth of it is..  They say they need to enrol international studnets because we don't have any people wah wah wah.  NZers don't want to be enrolled in grad research degrees!  We actually don't have any studnets.  That's how competitive it is.  It's sooooo competititieve that there's nothing there in fact.  Turns out only 1 or 2 people want to do something that only needs 1 or 2 people to do it in fact.  But that's not very gratifying for people who get off on being abusive bullies, now, is it?  It must  be competitive!  The kiddies must be falling over each other to do anyting anything anything.  Unbridled greed.  F*cking psychopaths.  </p>

                            <p>I remember being targeted for a stats NZ survey, however many years ago.  Someone knocks on my door and tells me that I've been selected to fill out a survey.  That I'm required (by law) to let them into my house.  I'm required to listen to them read the questions and tell them  my answers.  And they will write their understanding of the answers to the questions down as my answers on the stats NZ survey form.  I tell them that I really don't think so (I mean most people are working 9-5 and clearly are not participating in these shenanigans when the stats NZ surveyers keep the same hours).  I tell them to leave the forms and I'll fill them out myself and post them to the address I'm required to post them to...  And they won't do it.  They just won't do it.  Nope.  Not going to happen.  That's how much the government was refusing to do the stats NZ surveys properly.  The biased sample they were getting (only from people who happened to be home when the surveyer came.  Only people who were bullied into cooperating).  The surveyers were making up answers.</p>

                            <p>Bullies, Hey.  Then the Covid Nasal Swabs.  Targeting the children of a south auckland school.  Telling people they were required to have nasal swabs stuck very high and very hard up their noses in the  name of public  health.  Yeah, right.  Targeting the children of south auckland.  The immunisations.  The people who couldn't have one when they wanted one (never will be enough to go around) the people who were forced to have one when they didn't want one...  The bullying and abuse.  The constant bullying and abuse.  The asking people what they want / need -- for the purposes of being withholding only.  The blatant bullying and abuse.</p>

                            <p>About 10 people want to do something that only about 10 people can do.  Therefore we will roll out a marketing campaign or whatever to get 1,000,000 people all signed up..  They all want to do it!  They all want to do it!  They don't really... But we are drumming up demand!  Now we can teach them all 'awwwww we don't always get what we want we can't all have what we want'.  It's sooooo competitive.  THe 10 people who wanted to do it in the first place can't do it.  Don't get to.  None of them do.  A group who never wanted to do it does it instead.  Because they have been told what they want and what they want is to ensure that nobody gets to do what they want.  That sounds like the kiwi way, right there.  That's the real problem.  So far as I see it.  We will not f*cking well listen to what people have to say.  FOrcing and inflicting..  For the purposes of bullying and abuse.  F*cking hell...</p>

                            <p>WHERE'S MY MONEY.  Hey.  Time to deploy me into a position of being paid.  All these people on payroll to prevent and prohibit and confuse and obstruct and deny..  It certainly can't be that lack of capacity or knowledge or skills or training is the problem, here, because you'll appoint people into position with none of the above.  Apparently Ashley Bloomfield is professor now?  He never applied to be enrolled in graduate school.  He never wrote a research output.  He has no research output.  He never enrolled in or did the work for PhD or MD.  So they deploy him into positon with the 'University' of Auckland.  Makes sense.  HOw many hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars are they going to pretend to pay him to..  Lure international students here so they can treat them really really really really horribly in their public health degrees.  I suppose that's the idea.  He could be an avatar.  Likely he is.  Likely they don't pay him anymore than they pay Jacinda.  What is the point of Jacinda.  Saying that people should want to go to Harvard so they can be taught by people on payroll (supposedly or apparently) who don't have any research output at all.  That makes sense of why people would want to go to Harvard.  To be taught by such intellectuals.  Yeah, right.  What a f*ckign joke,  hey.</p>

                            <p>WHERE'S MY MONEY!!!  ALl these people over the age of 65 who have had more than 45 years of government payroll.  They have had plenty of time to plan for their retirement.  To save money for their retirement.  So, if they didn't want to retire, they could set up a private start-up or something.  Invest in the private sector.  Instead of being the biggest babies ever taking and taking and taking and taking from the public sector.  Expecting however many people to f*cking well curl up and die becuase they don't feel like giving up their payroll.  Get the f*ck out.  Stupid selfish idiots.  Ruining everything for us all.  The only thing you can say, really, is that at least they get the health system they made.  The aged care institutions they chose to invest in.  The dementia care facilities for theier obvious handicap.  Lack of empathy.  Lack of fairness.  F*cking psychopaths.  Not even trying to be fair at all,  hey.  F*cking hurry up and die, already.  It isn't like I'm saying to them anything they haven't overtly made f*cking well clear they plan for me.  F*ckign psychopaths.  Get out already.  </p>

                            <p>I suppose the best sense of it, really, would be that the new Epstein (or maybe even the old one) needs a new wing-woman.  Someone they can roll out and do big eyes 'awwww' so people feel okay about handing their children over to Harvard for Harvard to do a little anything anything anything...  How much do you think some rich alumni would pay to have Jacinda come stay with them in their summer  house at the Hamptons, or wherever.  Entertain people at private parties.  How much money do you think they could get from her (with or without her daughter) were they to do a fund-raise?  I wonder who her daughters parents are, actually.  Was she a genetic experiment from Harvard?  Incubated in Jacinda.  I suppose that would make pretty good sense of why they picked her to tell the grads of Harvard that nobody had been prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus (for trying to breed knock out babies) in NZ.  That it had been taken out of thte crimes act (even when nobody  had been prosectued for that when it was in the crimes act).  Maybe they should pay and pay and pay and pay and pay to come to NZL where they can do anything anything anything because we don't have any doctors.  Or judges.  apparently.  Need to pull them out of retirement.  No extraditions from NZL to stand trial.  Not part of the developed world at all, it seems.  Are things really that bad in the US that they need to market this when it comes to US influence?  Seems so.</p>

                            <p>It is an interesting thing...  How reading and writing is obviously and clearly involved in the production of research output.   How many hours per day, do you think, would be devoted to, or required in order to produce what kind of research output, to what kind of quality?  Does Jacinda Ardern strike anybody, anybody at all, as an intellectual?  Studious.  Spending her time reading and writing and thinking and working out.  Rather than spending her time yakkity yak yak yakking wheeling and dealing wining and dining.  There aren't enough hours in the day.  Wouldn't you say?  Oh, but some people are supermen amongst men.  They can be academic intellectuals at the very same time as being high performing politicians at the very same time as being dotting mothers and wives..  All the money for them, therefore.  Nobody else need apply.  Yeah, right.</p>

                            <p>I guess the ideal they want to present is that a team of disposable writers (AI or otherwise, it doesn't matter) writes the script for the person for however long...  Jacinda just reads from the script.  Then they can get rid of Jacinda.  Post the world post-cards.  The writing team can keep up the online social media accounts.  Nobody will  be any the wiser.  You could see it as uploading the person to the computer system.  We don't need Jacinda, not once she's been uploaded.  The writing team or the AI programme can keep making outputs they attribute to her and nobody will be any the wiser.  Another way of thinking of it was that she was carefully handpicked selected precisely because of her susceptibility to the AI virus that was to become her.  Her ability to read the teleprompt, I mean to say.  To riff only things that would be indistinguishable from a computer programme.</p>

                            <p>The real point purpose or function of AI is to make it such that only one god person will be god over  men and everybody else kept dependent.  COmpletely, totally, and utterly.  Right?  Isn't that the basic idea?  Everybody wants to be God.  To boss everybody else around.  Make everybody do everything it is that they say?  When they say?  Because they say?  Then all these people kept...  Dependent.  Unhappy and unhealthy, if need be.  Bullying and abusive.  Bullied and abused.  Is that fun?  Is that fun for you?  Or drip fed, I suppose.  We can all cry cry cry cry cry.  What's that Sterelny?  Why wouldn't you just kill me?  Why?  Big blinkity eyes.  Why?  Oh my...  Isn't there something that you can think of that I can do for you?  Oh mighty God master.  F*ckign psychopath.  Paid to supervise studnets.  Where is the supervision then?  How can I possibly respect you when you don't have the most  basic of integrity?  Where is the evidence of supervision?  If you are too busy else lazy then, whatever.  Get the work to the externals, then.  Let the examination proceed in your absense if you are too busy else lazy to do the f*cking job for which you are paid.</p>

                            <p>Why do they pay him?  HOw old is he now?  He still has an ANU email address?  Why?  What the f*ck...  Selfish selfish selfish he's soooooo f*cking selfish him and his f*cking selfish selfish selfish.  How f*ckign boring.  His studnets are apes.  He can't tell the difference between an ape and his studnets.  His studnets only function is to cry cry cry cry cry to him to  bend over backwards to please and entertain him all f*ckign day.  No.  I don't want to go camping with you ffs.  I don't want to house-sit for you.  I don't want to feed your f*ckign cats.  What's the f*cking matter?  You don't get paid enough to pay home help?  I'll just do that for you for free, then, and you can take and take and take and take and take and f*ckign take.  Is it dead yet?  Hurry up and f*ckign well die, you selfish c*nt.  Nothing you wouldn't say to (or about) me.  Right?  F*cking psychopath.</p>

                            <p>See...  You have these people.  Or maybe 'people'...  Who like to keep dependents.  They'd really rather be surrounded by blow up dolls, I think.  But I suppose there is this idea of the biggest trophy..  You know how it was..  The biggest black man.  Trained to not fight back.  The elephant.  Trained to stay in one place with only a tiny token rope staked to the ground.  The smartest slave.  The most highly educated.  That kind or sort of an idea.  A trophy...</p>

                            <p>And you see how to train them to be everything you want them to be.  How to raise an elephant.  How to raise a homo sapien.  To be everything you want it to be.  To say 'how high' and so on.  It's all very very entertaining to a certian kind of mind.  Good sport and all that.  Not much of a reach from there to things like SPCA..  You want to adopt something..  Something that will be forever grateful that you are the good rescuer...  You get to be and play the good guy.  There's quite the market for it...  So as to support however many animal rescue people to allow or sometimes participate more directly in the raising of abused animals.  So they can be sufficiently abused so as to be forever grateful for people who get off on adopting animals kept dependent and complinant in that way.</p>

                            <p>Moving up the food chain we come back to people.  Harvard wants all the teenagers of the world, do they?  They want to take their pick?  It's soooooo competitive all the kids are gneawing each others arms off to be picked out chosen as special, are they?  And what happens to them when they arrive, Shane Reti?  Do you remember?  Were you trained at all well?</p>

                            <p>And the children are supposed to...  THey are supposed to work for the University.  Arent' they.  Work in food service.  Work in cleaning and janatorial?  Work in the library.  Work in the gym.  They are supposed to donate their time..  Is it 20 hours per week?  Working for the University.  In exchange for their studnet scholarship.  Right?  And they get streamed into classes.  Right?  To make sure that Jacinda is in classes with other Jacinda's.  It isn't that Jacinda gets to hang out with various people's kids..  Ho ho ho ho ho others were streamed quite differently.  And others don't have to work.  They are allowed to spend their time actually studying the materials.  Perhaps...  Or perhaps they are expected to spend their time entertaining the alumni at various events.  Do a little anything anything anything.  Go away on camping trips?  All falling over each other because it's sooooooo competitive they must  be willing to do anyting and everything on demand *merely to have been given a chance*.  And when it's time for them to be paid (e.g., to actually gradaute or whatever) they volunteer to be suicided!  Who would have seen it coming!  Oh my!  </p>

                            <p>Really attractive, hey.  So motivating and inspiring.  Wouldn't you say?  You don't get a hard on just thinking about it?  </p>

                            <p>Well...  What is your process for hiring, then.  Hey?  Who are you looking at hiring -- and why?  Why was Richard Joyce traded to NZ in exchange for Kim Sterelny?  Why?  Why was Dr Leeks traded to Melbourne in order to facilitate his ongoing crimes?  We see what decisions they are making...  They throw everybody else's applications away...  Jonathan Schaffer...  Why was he in Australia for the couple years that he was...  SOmething about him leaving his wife..  Was she involved in University Administration or something for a student...  A grad student of a different Ivy league institution than the one he was enrolled in...  She got a post-doctoral fellowship to ANU and Jonathan Schaffer was payrolled (was he?) for a time...  So they could set up as a bit of a couple in Australaia...  But she was only a temporary hire..  A 1 year post-doctoral fellowship was it?  I wonder if she became his partner before or after her PhD was awarded.. I wonder if she ever got a job so that she could be independent or is he got bored with her and found another graduate studnet...  I don't know...  But I do know that Australia decided to get them to Australia knowing about the situation.  That situation was what made them desirable candiadtes, from Australia's point of view.  And the bullying of Aisling...  It was disgusting.</p>

                            <p>She was a good student.  She could have been a good post-doctoral fellowship hire for teh ANU if they had have got on with graduating her instead of stabotaging her.  Oh, but it's soooooooooooo competitive.  THey have to pay the likes of Kim Sterelny 3x or 4x or 5x or more...  They have to pay him so much in excess of a reasonable wage...  To better facilitate his destruction of as many others as possible..  The aim..  What's that Sterelny?  The ANU has always been very fragile with respect to the Philosophy Programme.  The entire reputation of the department was built on one or two or three big names.  All the students work was attributed to them.  I guess that's the idea.  People send their work to a big name in the hope the big name will publish it in a journal.  And the big name keeps it for themselves and / or re-attributes it to someone kept sufficiently dependent.  Dark ages, indeed.  Garbage dump of a f*cking wasteland.  Jacinda is supposed to be an intellectual. Really illuminating.  The intelligent dialogue and conversation.  She's..  So...  Uh...  well read.  Yeah, right.  What did Biden say to you Jacinda?  I wondered if he asked you if you could name any of the Presidents of the United States of America who had their portraits painted.  Could she name a single one?  Well, best hire for Harvard law or politics ever.  Could she name a single law passed by each one?  Best hire for Harvard ever.  You can see why people would want to go to Harvard.  Yeah, right.  There really doesn't seem to be anything there...</p>

                            <p>Look at their hiring practices.  And consider, then, the impact that that marketing has on the applications for enrolment that they recive.  They don't seem to care.  What was the impact of applications to Columbia after Meadow (from the Soprano's) plot-line where her mother was paying various sums to the University to ensure Meadow had the 'best possible student experience'?  Were people more or less likely to apply to Columbia?  What kinds of people?  What did it do for prospective studnets coming with money.  Wanting to give money to the University.  With them being blatant about that reputation.  I mean to say...  Columbia did not sue the Sopranos' for loss of anything.  For damage to their reputation.  I don't know if Columbia University paid anything to the makers of the show to write Columbia  in, specifically, as part of the plot-line.</p>

                            <p>People aren't applying to go to the schools.  That's why they are so keen to tell anybody and everybody about just how competitive it is.  They get $80 US for...  How many applications?  How many paid applications do they get every year?  Enough to fully fund a place for the VC's kid?  Or is it more overtly pay to win?  What does 'winning' mean or look like, exactly?  There really doesn't seem to be anything there...  Hey..  Look at their practices around studnet selection.  Look at their practices around grading and graduation.  Look at who they bully into fleeing (and most importantly why).  Look at all the work they take from some and re-attribute to others.  F*cking joke of a hoax of a f*cking scummy scam.</p>

                            <p>What's the great idea for public health in NZ, now?  They are hiring a manager!  See who applies to do that!  What's the goal?  We make up a little survery.  Likely wtih confirmation bias locked in.  There was a script for a song...  'Do you wake up tired in the morning?'  It's trying to sell pharmaceuticals...  They want to target Chinese NZ and Indian NZ etc etc communities and see how many people they can get signing confessions that they are experiencing symptoms of dementia.  Why?  Because if they can say they have dementia (gaslight them into believing it) then nobody will mind or be surprised when they simply take control of their assets.  Because, you know, people with dememtia cannot manage their money.  You know how it goes..  Westpac wants to advertise and market and target specifically.  Imagine how much money Westpac could make if only all their clients had dementia and forgot where they put their money.  Forgot how much money they had.  What are they going to do about it?  Them and whose army?  Aw...  So, let's see how many targets can all voluntarily like be coerced into signign confessions that they are experiencing symptoms of dementia.  That's great.  I see why that position would all but fund itself.  That' a great hire for someone to be paid maybe $80,000 New Zealand Dollars to manage the great IDEA project from the world-class university of Auckland.  Really world leading.  Shipping the brains to Harvard (on autopsy at least) aren't we?  That's what it is or means to be intellectual.  An intellectual project managed by the University of Auckland.  The 'University'.  I guess they will have however many public health student volunteers to get out there doing the surveys.  Training them for doing other things in a similar vein.  Stats NZ survey forms.  Voting papers.  Maybe even administering vaccine.  Simply knock knock knock on the door.  'This injection is right for you the government has decided take it now or we'll take you away for non-compliance'.  That's why NZ got euthanasia shots?  When it was time to pay the workers, or something?  Just another decade or two of volunteering..  Just one more..  M'kay??</p>

                            <p>Awwwww.  It's sooooo competitive!  What's that?  The reputation of the ANU Philosophy programme is dependent on the reputation of Kim Sterelny.  Because everybody wants to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay to be one of his apes, one can only suppose.  Because he's sooooo f*cking selfish.  Because NONE of the studnets had oral defences to external examiners..  I mean..  Aisling's mid-term where Jonathan Schaffer tore her a new one..  That should have been her oral defence.  There should have been 2 external examiners (not just the one) and she should have been told tlhat it was the LAST hoop she had to jump through.  And it should have been open to the public.  So that everybody could see how Jonathan Schaffer conducted himself.  His professionalism etc.  So they could decide if they wanted to be associated with his style of examination or if they would be embarrassed for prospective studnets and their parents to know that that is how they treat their studnets.</p>

                            <p>Instead of having 3 or 4 or 5 people on payroll they hire 1 and pay them 3 or 4 or 5 times as much...  Trickle down economics, they call it.  Where the 1 gets to piss on everybody else.  And the effect of it only is to bully the people into fleeing -- because there's nothing there.  You can't get on and do the job.  It's sooooo f*cking hostile.  This 1 person being a big f*cking c*nt, right Sterelny?  When do you have time to write any research with all the drinking and holidaying and partying and camping trips etc..  We are supposed to believe you can go out drinking with your studnets and go back to the office and do your work processing journal submissions...  I guess it's not that hard to go 'me me me me me me me me me meme meme'  F*cking idiot.  And now...  I guess the 'University' probably still lists various people pretending that they are still alive and still on payroll and likely they aren't.   Because they were indistinguishable from computer progarmmes, wouldn't you say?  String together a words salad of quotes from google and pass that off as intellectual academic.  They don't need to pay teachers of University any more than they need to pay teachers of any other thing at all.  Just put actors into position, I suppose.  Just read teh script.  Then, when it's time for us to pay you we'll just murder you off and replace you with someone else who will jsut read the script.  There's nothing there. hey. 
                            </p>

                            <p>Where are all the theses?  Where are they?  WHere are all the research outputs of the Univesrity?  Where are the research outputs of the studnets for the first 6 months?  The first year?  Where is the work they have done in 2 that went to externals?  There's nothing there.  F*cking psychopaths.  There's nothing there.</p>

                            <p>What a f*cking joke to think there would be a health system.  Why would anybody help you?  What a f*cking joke!!!!  It's sooooooo competitive!!!! There simply isn't any purpose or point..  What are we competing for?  Control of people.  Right.  And for people who are interested in and focused on independence and equality and things like that..  Well, then, there isnt' anything to see.  There's nothing.  Nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing at all.</p>

                            <p>I work for Martin Davies over the summer - and he won't even write me a reference.  F*cking c*nt.  Who does that?  If I was a pedophile..  He'd write me a glowing one.  Right?  We can see what it is that they value.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                            <p>'Welcome to Medical School everybody!!!! It's soooooo competitive!!!!  Take off your tops everybody so I can fondle your boobies in the name of teaching you how to do a breast exam.'  Might want to give the information to the kiddies so they can make an informed decision about what it is that they want to do.  Because there's nothing there, hey.  Who is going to teach in your medical school?  Who did you graduate?  Who did you enrol in the first place?  Not exactly a medical school, hey.  Cry cry cry cry cry for visa re re re re re processing fees.  What a f*cking joke of a f*cking hoax of a f*cking scam.  Apparently Sah is a medical student doing her internship year.  So she's studying medicine (reading medical books actually studying) and she's doing her internship placements..  Around the hospitals of Auckland, one can only suppose, with the associated commute timees..  And she's also teaching maybe 3 gym classes at various Les Mills across Auckland with their various commute times, too.  Teaching gym classes in teh morning and lunchtime and in the evening too.  Oh my, she's Superman!  Blessed with the innate power to teleport!  To stop time!  She's my f*cking hero!!!  What medical school, hey?  It doesn't make any f*cking sense at all.  APparently Amy is a ED doc.  Where does she find the time?  To do the ED shifts and to teach all the group fitness classes that she does for Les Mills.  That's what the ED docs want to do..  Leave a however many hour long shift..  And present all high energy hype hype hype for dance classes and spin cycling.  No cortosol overload for Amy!  Superman!  It just doesn't make any sense..  Oh..  Did they do personal training qualifications, did they?  Did they do a personal trianing qualification?  Level 5 or level 6?  They are qualified to teach exercise instruction?  Group fitness?  When do they study the choreography?  When do they have time to learn the latest releases?  What a f*ckign joke.  What a f*cking joke of a hoax of a farce or a scam.  It's soooooo competitive!!! Everybody wants to study medicine!  When studying medicine means getting to ponce about the stage and have all eyes on me for the latest Les Mills group fitness release.  I mean...  How much kuru do you think there is and must be..  How much dementia in the people of NZL...  F*cking hell.  I mean seriously...</p>

                            <p>What health system?  But then..  What group fitness system?  What education and training system?  It's supposed to  be an international business.  Yeah, right.  What a f*cking joke. Don't say we don't value the arts...  People watch Shortland Street..  What need then of such thing as 'medical school'.  It's soooooo cmopetitive.  Aw.  ANd there isn't anything that we can do.  But we got this euthanasia shot for being all science led.  When it was time for us to pay you we decided that you had been consented.  No surprises there.  Nothing here, hey.  Not motivating and inspiring at all.  No wonder the people are sick.</p>

                            <p>See...  Here's the thing...  I actually enrolled in a Level 5 Certificate in Sport and Exercise Science with WELTEC, at one point.  I did not complete the year.  For various reasons.  It was interesting, though, that they paid someone to go fetch people.  TO ensure they got them through teh course.  They paid someone to physically go get studnets and drive them to class etc etc.  But of course they weren't at all concerned about not completing me...  'Don't worry about her she'll be alright'.  She can go to Auckland and maybe get in to Medical School.  WHereas the other kids in the class...  They can't do that.  So they really need this.  That was teh idea.  Insofar as anybody bothered to explain it to me.  Why they were so concerned abotu passing them -- and failing me.</p>

                            <p>So, there were many great kids in the class.  And not kids.  Adults.  A guy who was a welder who wanted a change in occupation.  A guy who was a volunteer firefighter who wanted to get back into shape for that and maybe pick up some paid employment on the side. But we are supposed to believe...  That Amy and Sah are the only people who could possibly be payrolled to teach group fitness classes for Les Mills?  They couldn't possibly have found a Level 5 or 6 certificate qualified person to employ for that job?  They had to hire a supposed Medical Student and a supposed Emergency Room Physician to get up on stage and do group fitness instruction.  They simply couldn't have hired anybody else?  Nobody else was competent to do the job?  </p>

                            <p>What the f*ck is wrong with this country, hey.  No skilled labor.  There will be no skilled laborers.  Nobody is allowed to do anything that couldn't be done equally well (or equally badly) by anybody else.  Replacable disposable units.  Don't need to pay anybody at all!!!  They actually pay them to teach group fitness classes?  That doesn't seem particularly likely...  DOn't they pay and pay and pay and pay Les Mills for access to the newest choreography so that they can sit examinations to be passed before they are allowed to do the routine on stage?  Isn't that the eway the international business works?  It works because they pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay?</p>

                            <p>I did not sleep with Richard Joyce, for hte record.  It wsa fairly obviously to me that he fancied himself in that way so I steered well clear of him.  I did have a relationship, for a time, with a visiting professor from overseas.  It did not work out well.  It was obvious to me that I was..  To be kept dependent.  What was the plan?  What was the plan supposed to be?  I'd just hand him all my work and he could pass it off as his own, then?  That it would be okay, somehow, because I could give him a child?  Live vicariously through that?  Or...  What, exactly?  How was it supposed to go?  I mean..  We fairly clearly weren't equals so...  I was unhappy.  Yes.  And he was unhappy with me.  Well...  That's not exactly the American Dream, is it?  To marry a doctor and be kept dependent?  Someone who..  Takes his father's old job once his father dies because of who is father was.  Birth him a child...  Be homemaker.  What part of me looks like I'd make a great homemaker?  No freedom.  No justice.  No equality.  No equality, at all.</p>

                            <p>Apparently or supposedly various other people made it.  People who demonstrated their willingness to sleep their way up...  Or whatever.  They 'made it'.  They are living their dream, apparently.  I'm not jealous because they don't have what it was that I wanted, they don't have that at all.  What it was that I wanted isn't such a thing.  Apparently.  There isn't any such thing.  It's all been over taken by taken over by psychopaths.  And there we go.  </p>

                            <p>Why would anybody on payroll teach a student anything?  Why?  Why?  It just doesn't make any sense at all...  Why would I have a kid unless I wanted to force it to do everything I wanted for myself..  I'll just inflict that upon it and force it to be what I wanted for myself.  Because that's the respectful and humane thing to do.  Clearly.  And it's okay...  They can have their own kid, in turn, to treat as their own property and force to be everything they wanted for themself.  You know. To maximise unhappiness for this hell on earth.  The way they want the world to be.  And so on.</p>

                            <p>But it's okay.  They got my nephew.  Right?  And he married an american so they got the closest thing to my kid in his genes there, I guess they would say.  Also they can probably easily harvest eggs from me once I'm dead.  And do whatever they want with them then, that way.  Maybe raise the kid in a Fisher and Paykal Incubator.  Set up whatever experiences they need for it to hear what a gamma baby it is and is expected to be however badly it needs to be treated to grow up to be so very very very very very very happy for whatever scraps and crumbs they throw at it.  If that's what their little hearts desire.  Well, then, so be it.</p>

                            <p>Living their dream, hey.</p>

                            <p>But,  yeah.  It's silly to think that there would be any such thing as 'medical school' where people actually got to study medicine for the purposes of humanely helping people come to make informed decisions about what treatments they do and do not want for themselves.  Etc.  There's really no such thing.  Bullying and abusive.  That's what there is in fact.  Cooersion and politicking.  There's really nothing there.  Why would anybody help anybody else?  It just doesn't make any sense, given the current climate, and all that.  Taken over by overtaken by psychopaths.  So says the mighty Kim Sterelny.  Almighty leader of the Philosophy Programme of the Think Tank of the mighty Australian National University.  Really leading the world, there, with the humane ideology spouted from the Philosophy Department.</p>

                            <p>I guess a main function of the Philosophy people is to sign off on all the animal experiments.  It's perfectly fine to treat insects and worms...  All the way up to the wild pigs.  Right?  'Pigs'.  Wink wink nudge nudge.  Let's start culling the numbers from helecopters...  Really motivating and inspiring.  Really living the dream....</p>

                            <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/500914/auckland-city-hospital-emergency-department-staff-frustrated-at-staff-shortages Awwwwwwwwwwww maybe you could divert Amy from her 'job' at Les Mills to work another shift at the hospital?  No?  Best be taking applications for visa from foreigners, then.  They can pay and pay and pay and pay and pay to... Well, you know..  Pay.  For our failures.  Quite by design.  We would design for things in no other way.  Awwwww.  We won't pay anybody to work that job.  Awwwwww.   Best you apy and pay and pay for our refusal to.  So that Ashley can have himself a payrise!!!!!     </p>

                            <p>The problem is the various people who are not supposed to be there -- who won't get out.  They won't take the breaks they've been scheduled to take.  They won't do it.  They insist on doing things they are not supposed to do (pretending to take over other people's jobs -- effectively prohibiting anyone from doing their job).  They bill and they bill and they bill the ACC for patients being kept in beds -- with no nurses.  They bill producedures they don't have surgical employees to perform.  Etc.  It's just a f*cking scam of a hoax.  There's nothing f*cking there, hey.  Yeah..  Amy is totally an ED Physician.  Yeah, right.  Workign her booty there on the Les Mills stage for the dance class.  That's what it *meeeeeeeans* to be a medical graduate of Auckland.  What it meeeeeeeans to be an ED Physician.  Doing the work of a 'group fitness instrutor' . Meanwhile, the studnets who have completed the level 5 or 6 training programme to be fitness instructors..  Well there's no job for them.  Because Amy is too busy strutting her stuf on the stage.  Pronouncing to be ED Physician!!!  NZL!!!  F*cking retard - land.  I swear.  I mean seriously...  THe state of the intellectual development. ..  Um..  What's the problem here?  WHat would you think it was?  What do you say??  </p>

                            <p>Awwww poooor Ashley.  He had two sons.  How much does it cost to send your sons to Harvard so they can be streamed, then, into Jacinda's class?  They had to hire her especially to deal with the f*cking idiots who thought their sons should be entitled to have a Harvard education.  Full fee pay.  How much does Ashley have to pay Harvard, then, to have his sons entertained by Jacinda.  Most highly intellectual and esteemed Professor or Harvard!  Oh  my!  They are sooooooo intellectual!!! The NZL government!!!! Oh my!!! allllll the readings and the writinggs.  Oh my!!!!</p>
