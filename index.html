                            <p>Full time GPA of 8.6.  But that's meaningless  because they don't grade things properly.  They will actually record that studnets have failed (F).   Not because they didn't go to class.  Not because they didn't prepare for class.  Not because they didn't do the readings.  Not because they didn't listen attentively.  Not becauase they didn't learn the content.  Not because they didn't demonstrate understanding of the content.  Not because they didn't engage in or with the content.  But because none of those things are valued.  We don't care about any of that.  In fact, identify the people who engage with education and fail those ones.  Then give the highest grades to the ones who didn't go to class.  And or who didn't to the readings.  And or the ones who yakkity yak yakked their way through the lecture.  And or the ones who didn't hand in their essays on time.  And or the ones who handed in someone elses and passed it off as their own.  And or the ones who paid the administration to record a higher grade.  And or the ones who bullied however many other studnets into leaving altogether because it's been taken over by psychopaths.  </p>

                            <p>For how many years are you supposed to pay the university pay the university pay the university pay the university -- before they are supposed to pay you?  If you are still at the university after that time then they pay you they pay you they pay you they pay you.  They pay you they pay you.  They pay you.  They pay.</p>

                            <p>There isn't anything there, you see.  It's garbage.  A f*cking hoax of a f*cking scam.  They won't pay people to research and teach.  They pay people to keep hostages endentured servants slaves.  They won't get the work out to external examiners and allow the students to complete the qualifications in a timely basis.  They won't pay the workers.  Theres nothing actually there.</p>

                            <p>What education and training system?</p>

                            <p>What judiciary?  I guess that's because there aren't any law graduates.  What health system?  No doctors or nurses.  Theres nothing there.  Garbage dump of a wasteland.  Not even trying to be fair at all.</p>

                            <p>What's that?  The Government is just a script-bot.  Designed to keep Australasia socially engineered as a prison camp detention camp slave camp.  That's how the administration governs still.  Either they choose to or it's just the output of script-bots.  Can't lay a complaint with the human rights people, for example.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  'There could be no application received that would attest to...'  Just put that down as the automated response to every complaint you receive.  'There could be no evidence recieved or accepted such that' for lowest perceived corruption ever.  Just script bot that every time.  Or only pay people to output indistginushable from a computer programme.  Script bot responses.  For the script bot 'judges' who can't see anything wrong.  No evidence could be submitted such that...  Theres  nobody home.  Nothing there at all.</p>

                            <p>Clearly the NZ government doesn't have any control of the con-munications.  They just read the script-bot.  The pre-approved script-bot questions to the pre-approved audience actors.  Mercenaries.  How much do they pay them?  Oh, they don't imprison them and feed them diseased rabbit organs that were fed to diseased rabbits to make more diseased rabbit organs to be fed to more diseased rabbits...  Who wouldn't want to work their way up the food chain and be responsible for feeding people to people to people to people.  It's all about the people, that's what script-bot Jacinda would say.  All about the people the people the people for some of the  highest suicide (also 'suicide') rates in the world.  Nobody would expect any different of the slave camp prison camp land of Australasia.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>Hi Kim Sterelny.  So great to see you arrive to start supervising me at the ANU 6 months after I arrived to start work on my thesis.  You can see the work I did in the first 6 months and over the first year.  What supervision meeetings were there?  Was a single meeting scheduled?  What feedback did you provide me on my written work over the first year?  Did you supply me with reading lists?  Instructions for things to be summarised or whatever?  What work did you ask to see?  How about over the second year?  That's documented here, too.  The work I did over the first two years of my doctoral candidature.  Where is there evidence of meetings about any of that?  Instructions for me?  Any feedback or comments at all?  WHY DO THEY PAY YOU?  Where is evidence of your supervision?</p>

                            <p>A PhD is supposed to be 3 years.  The examination process can take up to a year.  The external examiners checking it was the studnets own work.  Asking for more work.  More references.  Read this and add that.  Remove this and go do that.  Oral defence.  Another round of examination.  Did you send my work that I did over the first two years out for external examination?  When?  Did you tell me what I'd need to do before you would send it?  What the hell do they pay you for?  What evidence is there of you doing any supervision at all?</p>

                            <p>So then I go to the US for a year.  My work doesn't go out to externals -- you send me out to externals to do more work for them for 'non-credit'.  I'll give them written work for 'non-credit' will I?  What is the quality of that supposed to look like, then?  The 'work' that I hand over for non-credit?  What does that even mean?  Am I supposed to hand them written work for courses edited for non-credit?  </p>

                            <p>Then I go back to Australia and what supervision is there there now?  And I'm supposed to just keep handing them 'work' just keep handing them more and more and more and more while Kim Sterelny doesn't do anything at all when it comes to supervising me.  'We have been taken over  by psychopaths!' he declares periodically.  Indeed.  </p>

                            <p>What University?  There's nobody home.  Nothing there.</p>

                            <p>They won't get research out to external examiners.  I don't think they got any of the studnets work out for external examination.  I didn't see anybody have a scheduled oral defence or oral examination.  They just took the work of Australasians and handed it over to visiting academics from the Northern Hemisphere.  Mostly ones already on payroll.  And various people who visited the Australian National University to party party party.  Go to University to have morning tea, lunch, afternooon tea.  Drinks.  Dinner.  Go away on camping trips.  What University?  There's nothing there.  </p>
