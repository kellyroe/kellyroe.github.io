                            <article>

                                <p>Hey, It's not like it's any different from what America is doing.  How many undocumented people were there in RI, again?  As many as 1/4 of all the people, was it?  And then, of all the documented people, how many of them being unlawfully detained in a federal psychiatric institution?  When the patient notes say 'we detained them because we believed they were in danger of killing themseves' and the hospital conditions are such that they were placed in a seclusion or isolation cell with many hazards that they could use to kill themself..  That they were unlawfully given halluninagens (for example) or methamphetamine (for example) and not informed that they had been drugged..  It starts to look really rather a lot like a prison or a death camp.  Wouldn't you say?  All these people all up and volunteering to give up their lives so that..  Uh.  So that..  Uh..  So that however many people can pay up of 1 million USD to go to Medcial School so they can practice ventillating each other.  There's a medical student!!  Go get it!!!!  See if you can put in on a ventillator and make a little money off of harvesting it's organs.  It isnt' that you are trying to do to it any different from what it is trying to do to you!  Get in there!  Have a go!!!  Go be a winner!  Huzzah!!</p>

                                <p>Must be the kuru.  The prison disease of australasia that you get from cannibalism.  From the leaders only having gotten to be in the poisition they are in from them having eaten everyone and everything else until they are the only game in town.  Converting everyone to their ideology of their selfish selfish selfishness and their position being the only remaining game in town.  Race to the bottom of lives not worth living.  It gets the f*cking thesis to the external examiners when it is f*cking well supposed to.  What's that..  Oh your stupidity..  NO, your psychopathy means my life isn't worth living . All of the f*cking everything for you you vile nasty little man.  All of the f*cking everything for you and your f*cking selfish.</p>

                                <p>It's obvious, isn't it.  Why would I want to help you when you have declared war on me?  Hey, don't worry, I'm sure your special chosen children will help you.  Sure they will.  I'm sure they aren't little psychopaths pretending they want nothing more than to do anything anything anything anything anything you want and you say.  I'm sure they wouldn't use any power they had to weaken and exterminate you at the first availabel opportunity.  I mean, it isn't anything any different from what you would do.  Right?  Nasty bruitish and short little man.  It takes the f*cking thesis and it gets it to the external examiners. What the f*ck do they pay  you for?  What a f*cking farce of a hoax of a f*cking joke.</p>



                                <p>What are we going to do today?  Same thing we do everyday!!  Document the crimes of the government!  Document the crimes.  Document the crimes.  Documetn the crimes.  Yawn, f*cking yawn, don't they get sick and f*cking tired of all their atrocities.  Course not!!! They are the winners!  Winning!!  Winning at life!!!! ALl fo the everything for them.  All of the 'best' of the everything.  They're sooooo glad they are the alpha babies.  Getting to f*ck and wrongful death everyone as much as htey can in their nasty bruitish and short little lives.</p>

                                <p>Who do you think has control of drugs in the prisons?  (1)  The prisoners.  No matter what the people on the government payroll do visitors bring drugs to the prisoners and the prisoners distribute them to each other and take them all voluntarily.  (2)  THe people employed by the government to keep the prisoners.  The unpaid volunteers.  Because getting to do anything anything anything to the prisoners with complete immunity is it's own reward, I would suppose.  I think that most will agree that it is far more likely that the people on governemnt payroll (or the people who should be on government payroll) are the ones in control of the druggings in teh prisons.  So when the prisoners test positive for this, that, and the other drug, they are most likely drugs that were traficked to the prisoners by the people on payroll.  By the government 'workers' or by the government volunteers.  Why?  Well, why are they unlawfully drugging people in teh hospitals?  Sorry, the 'hospitals'.  Refusing to keep accurate medical charts.  Sorry, 'medical' charts of all the LSD and ketamine they are feeding peopple to help the people feel better about the various atrocities that hte government employees and volunteers feel like carrying out or committing.  Hey, here's an idea...  You could keep people addicted to opiates, for instance, and then give them a ready supply of fentynl on release.  They can voluntarily take it.  Or be volunteered to take it.  You could keep them in the fentynl new high rise slum built for Auckland City Mission.  That's a great idea.  No survivors and all that.  No survivors to bear witness to the governments crimes.  It's all sooooo competitive.  Gotta get busy busy busy looking for people who cannot will not get work done on time for sex offending wrongful deathbringers.  Must have.  Must have.  Must traffick them here from around the globe.  Must have.  Must have.  They pay for themselves.  Get in there adn take take take.  Real go getters.  Real winners at life.  What 'universities'?  What 'government'?  Nobody home.  </p>

                                <p>Kim.com should have been extradited under Australian Federal Law since NZ is a State of Australia, according to the Australian Constitution.  But the 'courts' and 'judges' who did hear the case were carefully carefully carefully handpicked for their inability or unwillingness to parse the constitution.  So they ordered that kim.com pay more and more and more and more and more and more money to the courts.  He should file this and that and this other and this other thing over here.  The scope of the case should grow and grow and grow. Much waxing on about irrelevant things.  Much holding everything up.  Pretending to be too stupid to progress things simply.  Just keep paying the courts kim.com keep paying the courts.  Pay off the courts to do anything anything anything anything.  I mean the fact that he is in NZ means he is in new-manus island detention camp of Australia.  Right?  Just keep paying (financially) just keep paying.  Just keep slaving for the courts.  Keep paying.  Keep slaving.  Keep writing more and more documents pretending to acknowledge the jurisdication and authority of the 'judges' and 'courts' who can't even parse the f*cking constituion.  I wonder what the contents are on his cloud server that the 'judges' of NZ and Australia don't wnt to see him extradited.  I would imagine AV footage of things the 'judges' don't want to be seen.  What a f*cking farce of a hoax of a scum of a f*cking wasteland.  What's the output of the Professors these days?  10,000 words every 5 years, was it?  Else they can kludge together their first year students essays into a book length work...  One every 50  years, do you suppose?  For people whose 'primary function' or 'primary aim' is research there was no other game in town apparently.  Nobody else applied.  Nobody applies.  Nobody applies for anything, in NZ.  Some peopel are just informed that this is the position and tiltle they will have and this is the money they will have.  ANd you find the slowest most stupid of the f*cking retards to pay the most to to do the absolutel least.  Found any teenagers to 'enrol' in NZ 'universities' lately Chris Whelan?  Does the governmetn give you a phone?  Phone records then.  Do they pay you to travel to vietnam and south america to party party party with peole who are apparently going to tgive you money and teenagers to put to work in exchange for no qualifications?  It's soooo cmopetitive, right Chris?  They will do anything anything anyhing...  Off to the death camps then.</p>

                                <p>Maybe get Justice Toogood and his many many sons (all and only people with the unwillingness / inability to do any work) and have them sing their triumphant song to the UN about how they are the winners at life.  I'm sure there are some real amazing party party party parties with the high paid government workes who have agreed to give each other diplomatic immunity so they can brag at the bar about the extent or nature of the atrocities they ensure happen on or under their watch.  So that they can live the lives they believe they are entitlted to, of course.  WHere everyone just sits about sing sing sing sing singing their praises each and every day.  While they pretend to hang their heads in shame for 5 minutes pretending that the atrocities are such a terrible terrible thing but nobody is bright enough to do anything about any of that.  And when it comes to employing the people who will figure out and action what do do about that there isn't any other game in town than the proginy of the offenders who are tooo stuuuuupid to calculte a GPA!!!  What winners!!!  What winners!!!  Them and their selfish selfish selfish.  THem and all their frienemies!  WHo will enjoy nothing more than getting to dance on their grave!  Getting to f*ck them with an edoscope and be all 'awwwwww I'm sorry you are going to die an untimly death awwwwww poooooor you' snigger snigger snigger guffaw.  It's soooooo competitive!   Soooooo cmopetitive!!!!!  The pretence of shame in our victory!!!  Soooooo competitive!!!! What fun to hang around with *friends*.  Oh me, oh my.  SO relaxing.  So *enjoyable*.  Mememememe mememe anda my f*cking selfish.  Everybody wants nothing other than to hang about with me singing my praises every day!  What a f*cking farce of a joke-land.  What a f*cking waste-land.  Nobody here.  Nothign home.</p>

                                <p>Some 'people' (shall we call them) seem to be having some qualms about campaigning for the upcoming election.  I suppose that may be a little heads up that 'I never would have been elected if I hadn't have cheated with the campaign funds' is something on internationl radar.  Maybe kim.com can buy this years election?  He could do the cloud server for storing peoples votes.  No?  What election?</p>

                                <p>I mean, if there was one thing we should have learned from the Holocaust it is that you don't leave surivors.  Why did ALan Hall not die all voluntary-like in prison?  People knew he shouldn't have been in prison years and years and years ago.  But they wouldn't get to feel very big and important if they didn't get to go 'hahahahaha and what are you, what is anybody going to do about it hahahahahahahaha'.  I mean the point is to demonstrate to everyone just how powerful and psychopathic you are.  I suppose.  I suppose there is that.  Why you leave survivors.  To be living monuments to how impactful you are.  Because thats how small you are.  Hey, I know how Sterelny and the ANU can feel really really really really big about themselves.  They can refuse to get my work out for external examination.  They can keep Carl Brusse enrolled for 10 years, was it?  Give his first thesis to people in Princeton to pass off as their own?  I mean, why else would people pay so much money to graduate class of whatever?  Do they pay extra to be handed a thesis that someone else wrote from teh trophy room to take credit for themselves?  Or did Professors or whoever on payroll pass it off as their own?  Since I suppose you get to feel super special big when you are employed into a position without the willingness or abiltiy to do the job.  Like Chris Whelan who has used his position as head of the NZVCC to refuse to process any of the complaints that he has received about the Universities of NZ in accordance with the policy that he wrote as to how he was going to handle complaints.  I mean there are reasons to believe in no private languages...  Rules he writes for himself to follow that he does not follow.  No speak English.  No speak any language at all.  He doesn't appear to be literate.  Nobody home.  ANd the Justice (the Injustice) who doesn't udnerstand that...  What a f*cking joke of a farce of a wasteland.</p>

                                <p>If you are 25 and you don't have full time payroll then I guess you should just be marched off to the deathcamp.  So that the governmetn can pay Una Jagose three quarters of a million per year to destroy evidence.  Ashley Bloomfield three quarters of a million per year to declare unlawful lockdown.  Ashley Bloomfield how much now, to be professor?  When he isn't even qualified for that position.  Quarter of a million per year?  Half a million per year?  Chris Whelan quarter of a million per year to blackbird for student slaves to oput them to work in the name of 'education and training' and have them deported and not given qualifications however many decades later...  Sent off to the death camps...  'Justice' Toogood and Mander..  Pulled out of retirement (after a lifetime of payroll both) so they can continue to take a million per year between them?  More?  To refuse to see half the laws.  To refuse to accept the evidence.  There just isnt' any money left for anybody else.  No work for anybody else.  Off to the death camps for everybody else so these f*cking idiots can take everything they believe they are entittled to.  Nobody else can do anything . They can do everything.  They are so glad they believe they are alpha babies!!!!  All fo the everything for them and theirs!!! Nothing leeft for anybody else!!!! All of the everything for their f*cking selfish.  Selfish selfish selfish selfish selfish.</p>

                                <p>Here is an idea.  You provide instructions to people regarding a medical admissions test: 'we do not reccomend or endorse the use of third party tutoring services'.  Then, on the front of the test you ask people 'did you use third party tutoring services'.  Then you 'definite no' everybody who does not say 'yes'.  Then you get to march all the students off to death camps instead of graduating them because you have documented how they are all unable to follow the most basic of instructions.  Again.  You have an ethics test.  You only enrol those who fail the ethics test.  Then you march them off to death camps when it is time to graduate them since they don't have any ethics.  They have all been volunteered.  All voluntary-like.  They have been consented.</p>

                                <p>I am trying to think of how old Elton John is supposed to be...  Let's see..  He was middle-aged..  Maybe his 30's or 40's or older?  When he sang at Lady Di's funeral.  So, how old is he now?  Is he even still alive, now, or do they have an impersonator pretending to be him in order to make money off of world tour visits?  People seem to want to travel to NZ and give world tour visits about 50 years too late.  I mean to say, Madonna...  How old is she, now?  Is she really still alive?  I wouldn't have thought so...  She was rather old when I was a kid...  It just doesn't make any sense.  This temporal smear-land.  All of the everything for Justice Toogood!!  All of the payroll for him for the next 200 years!!!  Only judge on payroll!!!  To hear (so to speak) everything over AV link.  No doubt.  Virtual justice.  No actual justice in fact.  Nobody home.</p>

                                <p>Weather bomb hits Auckland.  Indeed.  Urgency!  Emergency!  All eyes on me!  All eyes on me!  All eyes on me!  Some political figure gets to go 'awwwwwww' and console the people.  The people will be having tatoos of them, soon, like however many people voluntarily choosing to tattoo Ashley on themselves.  All voluntary-like.  All the people voluntariliy choosing to call volunteer services.  I don't think anybody is paid to get out there with buckets, are they?  I think you loot what you can find in your capacity as volunteer.  Don't you?  Wouldnt' you?  Something something about virtue being it's own reward?  Whatever...  I guess you know people aren't in their houses when they have been marched off from their houses all voluntarily-like.  By volunteers with fire trucks mostly, I suppose.  I suppose teh fire trucks are funded by or registered by something or whatever...  But they don't pay the voluntary fire service officers any more than they pay the voluntary ambulance officers to hold people in ambulances outside the hospital (UN inspectors don't inspect inside the ambulances outside the hospital, fairly sure).  What a f*cking joke...</p>

                                <p>https://www.newsroom.co.nz/experts-to-advise-govt-on-autonomous-sanctions-regime  Aw. They are going to pay a bunch of not-me a lot of money to do a late report about the sanctions that international community will likely impose on NZ for all the human rights violations.  Waikato was offering a 5 year double degree to students in China.  I wonder how many of them graduated within 5 years, while only paying the amount in fees, that was quoted when they applied to enrol in the double degree programme.  This was to be undertaken while they were in China.  I don't know if they were Uigur, specifically.  I'm sure Chris Welan and Squiggley will know.  How much of a scummy scam it was since we didn't see anything wrong with the slave detention camps of China.  I mean it isn't anything that the University of Waikato isn't trying to do.  And the Australian National University seems to think that that's the way forwards for Australia as well!  I mean, they don't seem able to parse their own regulations, their own constitution.  THey certainly can't get work to external examiners.</p>

                                <p>Yeah, people are really *friendly* in New Zealand.  Falling over each other to murder the competition.  Such a happy healthy environment.  Highest 'suicide rate'.  All voluntary-like.  Sure.  Of course.  Everybody just curl up and die so the Toogoods can have everything they believe they are entitled to.  All of the money all of the honors all of the awards.  Just take every f*cking thing and pretend to be too f*cking stupid do to your job then.  Can't possibly do my job in a timely fashion.  I'm too f*cking stupid.  Round up all the people capable of doing it and arrange for them to  be suicided.  Only game on town.  There was no alternative.  </p>

                                <p>There genuinely do not seem to be courts, much of the time.  I mean to say they are actually actively throwing away filings.  Refusing to process or progress them.  There don't seem to be any or very many judges on payroll, at all.  Justice Fitzgerald seemed to me to be legit.  But she was the only one.  Once they realised that I was right (and justice was not done on the High Court Proceeding so it would need to go through the court of appeal) they got a bunch of garbage out of retirement to pretend to be judges.  Just a f*cking scummy scam.  The AV proceedings are 'virtual'.  As in 'notn actual'.  As in 'there is nothing there'.  Just garbage bullying output of actors.  Urgency!  Emergency!  Urgency!  There is no alternative!  My way or the highway.   But there is no highway.  My way.  My way!  Urgency emergency!  Hand over everything everyhting everything to me!  Just f*cking die already!</p>

                                <p>The worst of it all is how there just doesn't seem to be any trying to be better.  It's all just 'wah wah wah!  and what are YOU going to doooo about it!!! hahahahahaha'</p>

                                <p>Isn't it nice that the surgeons son (all independently-like selected for Medicine) is choosing to stay in the Ukraine or Russia or wherever.  I don't think you need consent forms to practice operating on enemy soldiors?   Not sure..  Do you need consent forms to practice operating on friendly soldiors?  Frenemy soldiors, I guess you say.  Collecting samples or whatever.  Sticking them up the arse with an endoscope in the name of 'medical care'.  You do you...  Oh no, I'm sorry.  You do them.  Carefully handpicked for Medicien in NZ that you were.</p>

                                <p>I have a brilliant scummy scam (aka 'idea') for psychopath land.  It goes like this:  Lawyers who are retired (that is to say, not registered to practice) can offer their services pro bono.  They can say that they are offering skilled labor to help various people obtain justice.  Then they can be incompetent with their filings.  They can file a bunch of things that don't need filing, they can ommit to file a bunch of things that do need filing.  They can work to delay and hold up the process.  Really work to undermine and stabotage and...  Obstruct..  Obstruction of Justice.  ANd...  If anybody has a problem with that -- well, then, what are they going to do about it?  Spend the next 100 years complaining?  Have their registration revoked?  Ahahahaha.  So...  What happens with the 'volunteer' surgeons who are f*cking people up the arse in the name of colo-rectl cancer care.  I mean..  If htey aren't doing it properly..  What are they doing, exactly?  If they aren't doing a proper examination..  Skilled people..  With the intention of actually delivering health care..  THey are just f*cking people.  Right?  I bet they get really rather a lot of volunteers volunteering to f*cking people up the arse with an edoscope..  Maybe play a  bit with a laser...  Destroy a bit of tissue here there everywhere.  Maybe insert something so that a few weeks later there will need to be another operation.  That sounds like a good plan.  Right?  See if you can seed some cancer cells while you are at it.  Find some and then drag them about the place.  Help them seed.  That's how they got endometriosis.  Right?  Pushing the endometrial cells up along the fallopian tubes.  Maybe piercing the fallopian tubes and pushing the cells into the abdominal cavity.  Thats a great plan to make work for yourself later.  Right?  No fault medical.  No training,  here.  Just staffed with unpaid volunteers.  F*cking peole all voluntary-like.  Can't even calculate a GPA...  Must have...</p>

                                <p>Apparently I should stop because the people on payroll don't have the willingness or ability to keep up with me.  Therefore all of the money for them all of the payroll for them all of the employment for them because they can't / won't keep up with me.  That sounds like a great use of money.  Pay the slowest people who do nothing to hold other people as hostages.  I guess Janet Frame would never have produced the glorious monument to everything psychiatry is and represents in New Zealand if they hadn't have kept her in an institution and tortured her and had her document their crimes, document their crimes, document their crimes.  It's the only kind of art the government will fund.  Oh, they didn't pay her.  No, they paid psychiatry to abuse her.  I guess that explains all the people paying however much money for visas to come work in NZ as psychiatrists.  It's such a wonderful place where ACC will get it (actually wehre people can spend their entire lives trying to get funding out of ACC).  Garbage land.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>Australasia is a magical f*cking land all right.   No fault on medical.  Come to Australasia!  Commit all the medical atrocities you want.  Get busy raping and wrongful deathbringing.  Unlawfully detaining and drugging.  The government will never prosecute you for things like that.  You'll be revered and hailed as an almighty world leading leader!  Dr Leeks!  Must have!!!  Most desirable!  Best employee ever!  Took out how many people, would you say?  Disabled, murdered, eliminated.  Didn't have to pay a bunch of other people.  Once they were written up as vitims it was all over for them.  No payroll for them.  That's what that meeeeeeans.  Right?  All of the payroll for the violent offenders to support nd encourage and motivate and reward them for tehir crimes.  I guess all the visa applications they get of people wanting to come and join the no fault come here and do anything anything anything in the name of medical in the name of education in the name of most desirable must have-land.  Only the violent offenders need apply.  People who forged themselves qualifiations and references.  We'll need to look into them to make sure they are suitably criminal before we choose to employ them over locals.  The degenerte slaves by birth natives to this land.   No people,  here.  We don't see any people.  No peopel.   NOthing to see here, nothing nothing nothing at all.  No research outputs.  Even the first year students.  Outputting...  How many words per class how many classes per year?  It's all late.  Late!  Late!  Garbage!  Garbage!  A+ For late garbage only!  Only the latest of the late garbage gets entry to graduate school in these parts!  By which time there is no research output at all.  Everything on my writing page was jsut computer generated garbage output.  Not acknowleged by the tdhgjkerh dheijghdfjgh sdihrruighdfj apparently on payroll.  Apparently various other people are on payroll to output precisely about an average of nothing.  Every year.  What is the output of the Philosophy Department or the English Department of the Univerisites of New Zealand?  And those who actually do have an ouput thieve their work from Turnitin or submissions to their journal.  Their students work.  Bully them into dying and pass t heir work off as their own.  F*cking garbage land full of f*cking psychopaths.  That's for f*cking sure.</p>

                                <p>Stay with your friends do you reckon?  Live in their bedroom or their basement,  you reckon?  Should I just be a live in slave for Sterelny, then?  Housesit and do his cleaning and feed his cats for how many decades?  Is that how his other students got signed off, then?  What did they have to do to get their work acknoweldged in a timely fashion?  To get him to get it to externals if he isn't going to help then at least forward the work so that he isn't being a f*cking obstacle.  But then he told the administration it would be done in 3 months and did the admnistration get it to externals?  NO.  I guess I was supposed to live in University House forever and do their food service forever and give them anything I earned back to them in rent.  So they could take my research and give credit for it to other people and just keep me there for..  How long?  Replce me with a new model..  With friends like these who needs enemies?  I don't see friends..  I don't see people...  They don't seem to see me as a pereson...  Don't treat me with the basic respect they seem or appear to give each other.  Why wasn't my work acknowledged or progressed or processed?  It was good enough for various other people to take my ideas or take my write ups.  It was good enough to steal.</p>

                                <p>The Australian National University tells me they refuse to process an application from me for PhD in Philosophy now.  I tell them that they should give me credit for the work I have done for them, already.  Get the work I have done for them to external examienrs with a note to say that the administration failed to get it to them however many f*cking years ago.  But yay!!!!  THe administration has done it, now!!!  The ANU says hgirkghdfikjghf idghkfdghdfjkghdf not capable of processing an application for Philsoophy.  irhikfdjgh kdhidjghjfd kdshudkjghdfjk can't process an application.  I should try another University.  Or I should try applying to the psychology programme.  Kim Sterelny says that I am old woman so no job for me (only looking after his selfish genes).  But looking after his selfish was the only thing he ever thought of when it came to me, anyway.  Apparently I'm like Ben or Brett who came to him later in life therefore no job for me.  I'm not at all like Carl who arrived round about on time, actually, with an extensive background in not-him across the field of Philsoophy.  WHich means Sterelny gets to give all the previous work away and keep them looking after his cats that he can't be arsed brushing when he can't be arsed even leaving food in the f*cking house for you to actually feed them that's how much he cares for them, that's how important it is to him that someone looks after them while he's away.  F*cking psychopaths. Indeed.  For sure.  F*cking psychopaths.  That's what they keep telling me.  Why aren't you still in Meidcine John Matthewson?  Oh, it doesn't matter who does the work, only matters who is acknoweldged as haivng done it.  Oh, you aren't in medicine anymore because you are not a psychopath.  That's what you think.  Right.  Sure.  Of course.  Nice publications in Philsoophy John.  I wouldn't have thought that teh publications were things that you would have written, but I guess it's all about the credit, hey.</p>

                                <p>Maybe I should shut up?  I think various other people are on payroll to shut up, aren't they?  How much do you need to pay a research academic to output less than 5,000 word every 5 years-ish?  A hell of a lot more than me.  That's for real.  You don't pay me enough to shut up.  You want to know what immigration is for?  Ask Chris Whelan.  Blackbirding for student slaves to do the work for no pay.  So they can be sent home with no qualifications when it is time for us to pay them else give them their qualifiations else give them their qualifications and then pay them.  Bully bully bully them and abuse them and send them home cry cry cry cry crying about how badly we have treated them.  They did the work.  They did everything we asked of them.  But no qualifications no references no employment nothing nothing nothing.  Death camps.  Nothing.  Death camps.  Nothing.  Blackbirding for slaves.  Refugees to be put to slavery.  People to keep in concentration camps.  Governmetn detention camp slave facilities.  That's what the great NZ polytech is for.  Right?  To put people to slave-work in the name of education and training.  They accumulate debt in exchange or return for them doing work for no pay.  Biggest scummy scam of a prison camp ever.</p>

                                <p>Here's a plan for herd managment.  Get a bunch of violent criminal offenders and put them into positions in the hospitals and schools and various other things.  They are on payroll (if they even are on payroll, maybe you can scam them into paying you for the opportunity to offend) to disable, incapacitate, sicken, and weaken as many people as they can.  Put them to work, allow them to injure and maim and bully and abuse as many people as possible.  Then tell the victims that awwwwwwwww awwwwwwwww now their entire lives must be devoted to going on and on and on and on and on about how horrible and awful and permanently incapacitated and sickened and weakened and *unemployable* they now are.  How it wouldn't be proper to the memory of their abusers that they be allowed to have any kind of life or have any kind of meaningful employment.  The only thing the government will allow them to do is curl up and die.  Unless, you know, someone on payroll to bully and abuse and maim and so on wants them to live a slave in their basement or bedroom or what have you.  That might be a nice life.  We'll have to keep advertising and readvertising and readvertising and readvertising for the bullies and abusers to come here and do anything anything nything to the lowest valued people on the planet.  Have to get a New Zealander of the Year from overseas.  Because there dont' seem to be any people here.  Professorship for Ashley Bloomfield!  Never even applied to be enrolled in the PhD.  No research output.  Death camps.</p>

                                <p>You think I'm being overly dramatic about DEATH CAMPS?  Explain to Mason Pendrous Father how Canterbury University wasn't a death camp.  Explain to Olivia Podmore's parents how cycling NZ was not a death camp.  Explain to various other people how the University of Otago isn't a death camp.  People place bets on how many people in their residential hall will die during Orientation week ffs.  Death camps.  Death camps.  Died in state care camps.  Nobody saw it coming.  The death camp.  That it was a death camp by design.  Employees carefully selected carefully handpicked for hte death camp.  Students carefully carefully selected for the death camp.  Death camps.  Most especially and paritcularly when it's time to f*cking pay up.  Time to pay up.  HOw much does a f*cking piece of paper saying 'you did your work in a timely fashion' cost?  Death camps.  Death camps.  Death camps. Alll of the everything for the children of the administration!!!! How many frienemimes they wanna kill today???</p>

                                <p>Let's pull Justice Toogood out of retirement (because that' show you appoint judges) and get him writing reports of how f*cking blind he is.  Yes.  Justice Toogood is too f*cking blind to see any wrongdoing.  He doesn't see anytyhing wrong.  He can't and wont' see anything wrong and he will stay in office nd repeate that for the next 100 years so that the government doesn't need to pay roll an actual Judge.  Good f*cking job for him, hey.  </p>

                                <p>https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=one+of+the+few+pink+floyd+youtube+#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:d9a9ffe1,vid:pKNi98SQ5pQ  That's a good job for Ashley!</p>

                                <p>They've started up with articles about child prodigies now.  What happens to them when they grow up?  Not a lot has  happened in physics since Eienstein?  But all the prodigies there have been...  All the 6 year olds enrolled in AUT, was it Chris Whelan?  They were soooooo mature they just belonged in the only people you would put on payrolls dungeons.  Or bedrooms or whatever.  They have a tendancy to burn out young.  Don't they.  They child prodigies.  Right about when it is time to pay them, conveniently enough.  Then, all of a sudden, they don't think they are valuable anymore.  They were only most highly valued and desirable when they were young enough to be dependent.  Or when you could say they were retareded in tehir brains.  Right?  That's partly why all the work on Angelman Syndrome and the like.  Trying to breed a lower slave class who would simply giggle adorably no matter what you did to them or forced them to do.  Quite the knock-out babies.  Most highly desired.  Highly desirable.  Alll of the moeny to people wnating to breed knock-out  babies.  Raise them in government institutions.  Pimp them out on the weekends no doubt.  The very very clever clever clogs sooooo clever they can't possibly calculate a GPA.</p>

                                <p>I can't imagine they'll end up with any people.  I mean who is giong ot fill out a f*ckign census form?  Why would they?  I don't think people acknowlege the government, actually.  Governments are supposed to have varuios things to do with education and health and judiciary.  Bukt there's nothign here.  I don't see how there can be a government when there isn't any health system or education system or judicary.  Just prison or detention camps up anad down the land -- right Chris Hipkins?  Minister of Everythign?  What people?  I don't see any people?  I'm sure that you sure as sh*t don't see any people.  What happened to Jacinda's progency?  The Jacinda Ardern student to go to Harvard?  Are tehy all volunteering to nail themselves to crossed on enemy terrain like Baxter?  All voluntar-like during their smoko break?  That the ideal now?</p>

                                <p>https://www.newsroom.co.nz/now-is-the-time-to-embed-research-into-nzs-healthcare-system  They WILL NOT CALCULATE A GPA according to their published algorithm.  But they are apparently or allegedly competent to do clinical trials?  They can't process applications to enrol ffs.  They can't  / won't keep accurate student records.  Accurate records of enrolment.  They won't keep accurate transcipts.  They won't keep accuate hospital records.  They won't keep accurate medical records.  They won't record all the medications that were given to the hostages on the medication charts.  They won't let UN inspectors have unreserved access to all of the rooms in the f*ckign 'hospital'.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  March them off to the f*ckign death camps.  They aren't doing any of the things that they are supposed to do.  They refuse to accept that people have submitted research work.  The courts refuse to accept filings.  Just won't f*cking well do it. Nobody home.  Nothing there.  Now they are giving 'Professorships' to people who never even applied to do PhD's ffs.  Noboody home.  Nothing there.</p>

                                <p>Hey, I know what you should do.  Get all the Medical Students (whose mummies and daddies pay thousands and thousands of dollars for them to be enrolled DESPITE the published selection criterion) and get them playing doctors and nurses in the secure wards of the hospital. That is to say the wards where the patients are not allowed any visitors.  So there aren't any witnesses on what is wrong with the 'food'.  Get them practicing their physical 'clinical examination skills' and so on on people who are being held in the hospital under supposed or apparent mental health orders (only they aren't being and they can't be - because they didn't do any of the f*cking paperwork that needed to have been done ot make that f*cking lawful).  They won't allow them lawyers.  They won't allow them phone calls.  Then they get the stupid f*cking psychopathic imbecels of the administration to practice playing doctors and nurses.  Only treat the involuntary.  Get in there!  Have a go!!!  Just take everything.  Just keep on taking everything.  Take all of the everything.  Just get everybody to lay down their f*cking lives for you.  WERE ARE THE CONSENT FORMS?  Nobody home.  NOthing there.  What hostpial?  What University?  What a f*cking farce of a hoax of a f*cking scummy waste land.</p>

                                <p>The worst of it is that there is no f*cking 'try'.  Just closing ranks and hahahahahahaha ha ha what are you going to do about it??  Hahahaha ha.  Not the developed world.  Not even a litlte  bit.  There's f*cking nothing at all.  Nobody home.  F*cking psychopathic idiots ruined everything for us all.</p>

                                <p>Hey, I have an idea!  It's a great idea!  Let's take retired judges (with absolutely nothing to lose) and see how many filings and refilings and refilings and refilings and refilings there can be while people try and have them removed from office via proper process (when they never were appointed  by proper process in the first place) over the next 20 or 30 ot 40 or 100 f*cking years.  Let's see how long it takes for the people to clue in that they only way they get the f*ck out is their own 'personal decision' to 'sucumb to bulling' all 'voluntary-like' else it's night night for them the good old fashioned way.  What happened, Stuart McCutcheon?  Where did you go?  But all those people claiming to have been raped (for example) and deported without the qualifications they had done the work for.  What happened Stuart McCutcheon?  And of course now we will have to take a Nottingham Graduate from England..  Phd in mental health nursing, was it?  So as to ensure they keep on keeping on with the LSD trials (mostly undocumented) and so on.  That't not medical research.  That's something different entirely.  F*ckign psychopaths pretend to be too f*cking stupid to calculate a f*cking GPA.  And yet they are supposedly ouputting reputable scientific research.  Involving actual f*cking data.  Don't f*cking make me laugh.</p>

                                <p>They hide the NZMJ behind a paywall.  Mostly there are a small handful of people who get ALLL the publications.  Sometimes they throw a bone to their studnets and they will put their name on a publication with a student else they will allow their students to publish something.  I don't know how much the students have to pay for that, I don't know if the work is plagarised (the researcher gives the student credit for only something the student did not do).  But the point of those seems to be to documetn the crimes.  Document the crimes.  Documetn the crimes.  There is an ethics class they are mostly required to do.  Where they are required to confess that they give cervical examiantions to people without their consent.  They are supposed to write about how that makes them feel and the justification for it, and so on.  They are required to confess and document their crimes and hand their written confession over to the Univesrity so that they can be sure to place the worst of the offenders only into the positions.  It is not an education and training system.  That is correct.  It is a socially engineered environment attempting to socialise psychopathy.  THe purpose goal aim or point being to eliminate main incapacitate weaken sicken destroy prevent prohibit obstruct confuse...  There is nothing here.  By design.</p>

                                <p>What is the end goal here?  Just stop giving people birth certificates.  Passports.  Education Qualifications.  Just send them nonsense garbage sayign they owe hundreds of thousands of dollars to the NZ government because they needed to borrow from the government for basic things (notably housing).  What do we do to force the people to understand that their job, the one the government has decided is right for them) is the production of gamma babies to be handed over for other people to abuse.  Governmetn workers, particularly.  Will not process applications.  Will not do it.  Ashley is a professor now?  He hasn't even applied to study for PhD!  He hasn't even written one!  He has no academic outputs!  What University?  What a f*cking farce of a joke of a hoax of a wasteland of garbage.</p>

                                <p>I'm waiting on the social security tribunal to deliver a judgment.  Apprently they don't provide teh financial assistnce (addvance benefit payment) for people to pay the security for costs amounts that are ordered to be paid to the courts by the courts.  In this manner mode or way tehy prevent prohibit nd deny people being held by the government on welfare from having cases heard in the court of appeal.  They say I am out of time on my filings.  My filings were done YEARS AGO.  But they demnded security for cost to be paid else they don't accept my filings.  It was AFTER they demanded security for costs to be paid and AFTER they said my filings were 'out of time' because they don't accept them because I didn't have more than $20,000 security for costs that they demand to be paid that the health profession tells me that my mother has died and I am told that some money will come to me as inheritance.  So I'm supposed to what?  Hand over my inheritance to the courts, now, because of the wonderful job they have ben seen to do upholdling justice (follwo that over on teh judicial review pge).  So..  What happens best case?  I get selected to work amongst all the pedophiiles nd rapists nd children of the administation to be put to work wrongful deathbrinign and so on.  That's the best case here?  </p>

                                <p>The sexual offender they hired (knowingly, no doubt) who likes to take women out on dates and drug them and pretend to give them cervical exams..  What does he teach the 18 year old medical students about how to give exams?  Does he require them to act as models for the class in exhange for maybe possibly he might sign off that they have completed that part of their training?  Is he teachign the 18 year old boys and girls in the name of 'medical education' is he?  A little primer or prep work before they encounter the likes of professor Glue?  What a f*cking joke of a hoax of a farce of a scam.</p>

                                <p>They don't even appear to be trying at the most basic of levels.  Apparently I owe the NZ government more than 100,000 in student loans for qualifiations they refuset to accept.  So that ashley bloomfield can be appointed into positions he isn't even qualified for.  It's a f*cking stupid f*cking joke of a f*cking joke land.  Apparently the socical security tribunal has been 'sick' so there's no ETA on the judgment.  But there will eventually be some kind of declration from the courts that the Governmetn can hold people on welfare, if it likes, and refuset o accept filings.  Refile your filings Ms Roe.  Refile your filings. Just write us another PhD thesis Ms Roe.  Ashley doesn't have credit for one yet.  Why don't you write us another one Ms Roe.  ANd we can record more nd more and more moeny aginst your name tht you ower the governmetn for your education that we refuse to accept.  We wont' get your thesis out to externals because we need to give you thesis to the likes of Ashley so he can have a research output too.  Otherwise that wouldnt' be fair.  </p>

                                <p>This gynacologist who was recently given 3 month suspension for sexually abusing a person on a date (they called it flouting the regulations that he was giving her an unauthorised sexual exam or whatever).  So, does he have a history of that kind or sort of thing?  Was New Zealand being informed of his history the reason why they saw fit to hire him?  I mean to say, was he literally head-hunted by the New Zealand Governmetn because they intentionally wanted to hire him for all the qualities that they value?  Would he have been able to obtin registration, government job, if he had not been known to be up to these kinds of things?  Because he was most desired to come here and teach and show everybody in New Zealand what is normal standard typical desirable normal behavior in these lands.  Nobody else can be selected, graduated, employed.  Because they have head hunted all the people they want on payroll for all the qualities they value.  Only offenders and violators need apply.  Why wasn't he sent to prison for his criminal offending?  Oh, because sexual offending against other peple is nomral typical.  Desirable.  Must have.  IN these lands.  That's why they encourage the nudity at law camp and give the professor most responsible re-deployment with payrise once it becomes known.  Etc.  I bet this guy probably isn't going to speak up about anybody else on goverment payroll misusing hospital drugs or whatever to supply them to people and arrange for them to be sexually abused and wrongful deathed and so on.  I bet he wouldn't speak up about Professor Glue and the various people up to that with ketamine in Dunedin. Whatever it is that htey are doing with the LSD they are manufacturing in Auckland.  Trying to be the next Timothy O'Leary.  I't's disingenuous.  It's not very bright.  They can't even properly calculate a GPA!!!!</p>

                                <p>The report that was done into the VC of Queensland giving his daughter a place in the Medical Programme when her rank order score wasn't high enough for offer of place (basically the converse or flip of what Auckland did to me in not offering me a place even though I should have been rank order scored high enough if only they calculated my GPA properly).  They wrote a report about how what he did was wrong.  But tehre were no consequences to him or her.  He voluntarily chose to resign -- but I suppose the main reason he took the job was to use his position to the benefit of his daughter.  Anyway, point is that the institutional response to the report is again 'f*ck you were are only getting started'.  It was AFTER that report that Chris Whelan was appointed to throw away complaints of wrong doing in NZ.  And, I imagine, after the report that the rate of children of the administration being given preferential selection into Medicine etc etc really kicked up another notch.  I would imagine or suppose.</p>

                                <p>There was something very recent about a guy from there resigning.  A guy from there who had three sons who all became surgeons.  In other words, all three sons were given places in the Medical School there, graduated from there, and put to work collecting him patient samples.  What are the odds of that happening?  Just so we are clear about the motivation for selecting some people to become surgeons.  Whose interests are most taken into account when it comes to selecting for all the qualities that we value, I mean to say.</p>

                                <p>The Marc Hauser lab.  I suppose the main thing that Harvard was trying to teach the world, there, was that you have to carefully carefully select your students into the graduate research programme so that they will never never speak out about the lab not doing it's research properly.  I mean to say you need to pre-screen them so that none of the graduate research students allowed in the Marc Hauser research lab (or any other lab for that matter) would ever ever dream of speaking up or speaking out about falsified data or what have you.  I suppose it was a direct result or consequence of the Marc Hauser situation that Auckland does the second year bradycardia lab the way they do.  So they can identifiy the students who sat in the lab until they got a temporal time slice showing bradycardia and then wrote up that they found clear evidence of the dive reflex.  Must have.  They will find you all and only the data you want.  To show whatever you want.  Whatever the governmetn wants.  For whatever ends there are.  Whatever you desire.  Anything anyting anyting.  Must have.</p>

                                <p>The thing about computer modelling is how easy and cheap it is (relatively speaking) to do a 'stats reroll' until you get the data you like.  If you get odd findings 2 per cent or even 5 per cent of the time then you can reroll until you get the findings that you like.  You can do something like this with your lab experiments, too,  but it's a bit more costly to do it.  Only take a subset of the data that shows what you want to show.  That's why systems with integrity demand ALL the data to be supplied and not a cherry picked 5 or 2 per cent of the data.  Because, via that process, you can make up anything anything anything you like.</p>

                                <p>-----</p>

                                <p>There are different ways of defining 'psychopath' in the standard literature on psychopathy.  Sometimes the term is reserved for only the most severe or extreme or something like that.  That is or means to say that only a few of the prison population, say, would qualify.  Think, Hannibal Lecter.  Hand picked for psychiatry for all the qualities they value.  For example.  Mass murderers or what have you.  Maybe 10 per cent of the prison population or something like that.  So, very very rare.  Hitler maybe.  And a few of his close inner circle.  Not the majority of people who followed his commands.  Other times the term is used more widely or broadly.  On some estimations or estimate as many as around 98 per cent of people are psychopaths.  Or, sometimes the term is used a bit more moderately.  So, for example, first year business or management students are regarded to be a good proxy for psychopaths.  That is or means to say that psychologists who may not have ready access to prison populations have chosen to study business or management studnets because they have found many aspects or elements of psychopathy in these students. But anyway, you get the idea.  Some say that 'high functioning psychopathy' is prevalent amongst chief executives.  That they display many traits indistinguishable from the worst or most extreme subset of those in prison.  Headhunted for their most valuable qualities, one can only suppose...  </p>

                                <p>Some of the social psychology experiments or observational studies...  Consider, for example, the Milgrim experiment.  It was a psychology experiment that showed us that most people (around 90 per cent I think it was) would follow orders or instructions to provide electric shocks to another person until they died.  Of course it was a set up.  I mean to say the person was an actor.  Pretending to have seizures and fall down unconscious.  But most people would follow orders or instructions to 'please deliver this many volts of electricity to the experimental subject now' until the actor feigned unconsciousness.  That was back...  I don't remember how many years ago.  Then, afterwards the people were told that it was just an actor but they were experimenting on them, actually, to see if they would just follow orders to exterminate another human being, basically.  Which was allegedly or apparently disturbing to them.  To discover that the experimentor was going to write up about how most people would just follow orders or instructions to exterminate another human being.  So..  Most people are psychopaths, then?  Or most of the Nazi soldiors who marched people into the death camps were just regular people and not psychopathic at all?  What do we say about that?</p>

                                <p>Apparently some of them chose to sing triumphant songs while they marched people off to the death camp.  I suppose there may be a difference between just following orders (perhaps with overt signs of distress) and singing happy songs while you are following the orders.  With willingness in your happy heart.  I suppose there is that.  </p>

                                <p>There are other experiments like this, too.  That supposedly or apparently (perhaps) show us that perhaps about 90 or 98 per cent of people are psychopaths.  The Stanford Prison Experiment or things like it.  You arbitrarily divide a group and have half play 'prison guards' and half play 'prisoners' and see how the prison guard group chose to treat the prisoners.  Put them into a camp situation.  See how long before the 'prison guards' start treating the 'prisoners' inhumanely.  Misusing and abusing the power they have.  Treating them punatively.  Even when they know that the group was arbitrarily divided and the 'prisoners' are not actually criminals or convicted of any crime.  I mean to say the prison guards know they were arbitrarily selected to be in that group.  But still around 98 per cent will be seen to start to misuse their power and treat the others punatively.  Being arbitrarily withholding and depriving and so on.  And we know this seems to be true.  Right?  If we think about how people in quarantine (who had done nothing wrong) were claiming to be treated by people paid to be staffing the quarantine facilities.  And, of course, how people use their power in the schools, hospitals, prisons etc.  How politicians behave, even, to people perceived as their underlings.</p>

                                <p>They don't say very much about the 2 per cent who don't just follow instructions to exterminate a fellow human being.  They don't say much about the 2 per cent who don't use their power to be arbitrarily punative.  They don't say whether these individuals are the same individuals, or whether it is something more idiosyncratic to the situation.  I mean to say, it is a bit unclear whether it is that there are a few individuals who are not subject to these kinds of..  Peer pressure, will we call it?  Or if it is that most people have days where they will stand up or stand apart or something.  Follow something within themselves.  A conscience?  A sense of morality?  A notion of 'do unto others as you would have others do unto you' or something like that...  A bit hard to know what to say, here.  Many people think that you should absolutely treat others punatively and exterminate them in fact if you think you can get away with it.  I mean, it's soooooo competitive -- right?  It isn't like 98 per cent of the world isnt' trying to do the very same thing to you.</p>

                                <p>So, it is with this rather broader understanding of psychopathy that I say that this, that, and the other person is likely a psychopath.  It's sooooooo competitive.  That seems to be their view of life.  So we know how we expect them to behave.  So, then, there  need to be systems and processes in place for accountabiltiy because we can't think that they will self-regulate or act from any sense of internal conscience or morality or whatever you want to call it.  The lack of psychopathy.  Whatever.</p>

                                <p>The UCAT test for Medicine has an ethics section, now.  It is difficult, sometimes, to see what they are getting at with their questions.  But we can ask whether they are trying to see if people are the kind of people who will follow orders to murder on request (because they will do anything anything anything to do Medicine it's soooo competitive) and if that makes them 'must have' or 'must not have'.  I mean to say, are they using the ethics test to try and select people who are not psychopaths or people who are?</p>

                                <p>Marc Hauser was a psychology researcher in Harvard.  He lost the lab and was sent away in disgrace (or similar) because he was misrecording or misclassifying data.  Making up data.  Various things like that that was happening in his lab.  Apparently the students did not feel good about things like that happening in his lab and they looked into it and found him guilty of misconduct or whatever and he lost his position and a couple of his publications, or a couple publications from his lab were retracted.  Now, there are a few different things you can say about that.  Sterelny says 'it's not like he was doing anything differently from what everybody else is doing in science -- right?'  ANd that's one thing you can say, I suppose.  So, then, why did they go after him for that?  Maybe they didn't like his face.  I don't know.  Maybe he didn't make up enough data for them.  Maybe he wasn't corrupt enough?  Maybe Harvard simply wanted to make an example of someone so that more people would want to go to Harvard?  But most people are psychopaths, so that doesn't seem likely...  Hard to know quite what to make of it.  I don't know.</p>

                                <p>Anyway, I think part of the point of it was that there was some question whether he was responsible as the head of the lab or whether he could blame his students.  For only choosing to give him the data they thought he wanted to see.  That kind or sort of a thing.  And the answer to that was supposed to be that the buck stopped with him as head of the lab.  Since the students were not in the position or power or in a position of equality he was responsible for checking their findings and so on.  I'm not sure how I feel about that.</p>

                                <p>When I was doing second year physiology at Auckland I was not very happy about the way we were instructed to do a laboratory report on bradycardia.  Bradycardia is defined in the literature as a heart rate below a certain number of beats per minute.  That is how bradycardia is standardly, normally, or typically defined.  There is a literature on 'the dive reflex' where the critter (mammal) has a sudden drop in heart rate when their face is submerged in cold water and they hold their breath.  There is a bit of controversy over whether humans have a dive reflex that is had by other (particularly equatic) mammals, however.  Well, actually, there isn't.  The consensus in the literature seems to me to be that most people do not have a dive reflex, but that people have the capacity to train one.  So that trained or skilled free divers, for example, can induce one.  But it won't be found in untrained subjects.  Unless...  Now, this is a bit controversial (because of difficulty doing it in a laboratory environment).  But if you drop an untrained soldior (let's call them that) into cold water then...  How many minutes do you have to fetch them before they drown?  Or...  For how many minutes do you need to keep someones head under water to actually kill them?  I mean these are really important things to learn in the name of Medical Research really important scientific knowledge to help people.  Of course.  We want to help people live when we hold their heads under.  Of course we do.  Must fund!  </p>

                                <p>Anyway...  We were instructed to redefine the dive reflex (redefine bradycardia) so as to write up that we found evidence of bradycardia and the dive reflex in our laboratory.  Of course we did not - and we wouldn't have been expected to have found it.  </p>

                                <p>And then we are supposed to upload our laboratoy reports (where we claim to have found bradycardia and evidence of the dive reflex) to turnitin.  So that there is a record of how we are willing to re-interpret or mis-interpret data.  On the instructions of the head of the laboratory.  Of course Turnitin also records how those laboratory reports were graded by the head of the laboratory.  I mean to say, Turnitin also records how the grades were allocated or distributed across people who, for example, were willing to redefine bradycardia and the dive reflex in order to report they found it, and those who were not.  Those who wrote up that they didn't find it.  Or perhaps, even, the groups who happened to find that their data supported the dive reflex in fact.  They only saw this many breaths per minute.  No more.  They managed to get a temporal slice of their data such that...</p>

                                <p>So..  Is 'Turnitin' turning in the dodgey practices of the students or the head of the laboratory or both?  I suppose the idea is that 'they are all a bunch of degenenerate criminals in Australasia who cannot be trusted in a scientific research laboratory'.  Only degenerate criminals to be found in these parts...  But it is concerning, I would say, to find these practices in undergrarduate laboratories.</p>

                                <p>In third year physiology there is a 'bottleneck class' that is compulsory for all third year psysiology students to pass before they can complete the physiology major on the Bachelor of Science Degree.  The compulsory class involves doing something to a live sheep so that the heart stops and the sheep dies.  Only, before the sheep dies, students are to administer adrenalin and record how the heart starts beating again.  I don't know how many times you are supposed to administer adrenalin and experience for yourself first hand the thrill of having the power of life and death.  I thought to myself..  I wanted to do Medicine.  To help people.  And physiology is supposed to be part of Medicine.  Or something that will help people be better Medical Doctors.  How is this related to helping people?  I really did not want to do this class.  Particularly after seeing how the second year labratory assignments were regarded when it came to bradycardia and the dive reflex.  When there is a integrity that is lacking then what are we left with?  Experiencing the thrill of killing and bringing back to life and killing and bringing back to life.  Saying 'it's okay we are just following orders or instructions in how we write our lab reports and how we kill things and how we bring things back to life'.  It did not leave me with  very good taste in my mouth.  I dropped physiology.  I suppose that's the ideal really.  Isn't it?  So that we can say that only the criminal degenerates study physiology or medicine in these parts.  Only the psychopaths.  Everybody else was bullied into fleeing.  Everybody else voluntarily fled.  There weren't any people left.  No people wanted to do it.  It was sooooo competitive.</p>

                                <p>There's nothing there.  Nobody home.</p>

                                <p>I say 2 per cent. Or maybe it is 10 per cent.  It's an outlier, anyway, throw the data away.  Science (of the randomised control trial double binding variety) does not deal with outliers.  It isn't well placed to explain relatively rare events like which particular person will be induced to go postal on what date in what particular way or..  Which of them won't.  But the point is that it is relatively rare.  That a person will go against the grain or the flow.  I think it is something that has changed in more recent years.  They used to say 'don't give in to peer pressure, don't bow to peer pressure.  If all your peers jumped off the cliff then would you too?  Huh, huh?  Would you?  Would you?  I mean to say that was the messaging.  But the messaging is quite different now.  People are messaged very clearly that they are expected to huddle in with the herd if that means going off the cliff then there is no alternative.  If that means being hand-picked to herd a bunch of other people off of the cliff then again there is no alternative.</p>

                                <p>There is a wall history up by the (old?) land bank in the name of education or whatever it is...  By Les Mills, Newmarket.  It says that Liggins and someone were doing experiments on babies in utero from about 1960, before the University of Auckland was founded and before it had a Medical School.  That is or means to say the experiments on unborn infants has very very old (relatively speaking) history of something being done in Auckland.  Raising infants in incubators.  I don't think that anybody was ever trying to breed a superman or master race.  I think that the focus has always always always been on trying to breed an underclass of degenerate slaves.  To disable and maim and weaken and incapacitate.  To limit the potential such that we can say that the gamma babies are sooooo happy and lucky to be gamma babies because they don't have to work half as hard as Chris Hipkins.  </p>

                                <p>The UK people who write the ethics test say that it is supposed to be at the University's discretion what (if any use at all) they choose to put the ethics test to.  I mean to say, the ethics test is a portion of the UCAT.  It is up to the University of Auckland whether it wants to 'definate no' anybody who actually passes the ethics test?  What does passing the test mean?  Well, you could ask people outright, I suppose.  Would you follow orders or instructiosn to administer a lethal dose of something if ordered to administer it by a superior or something in the patients notes (quite independently or irrespectively of the wishes of the patient)?  That kind or sort of thing.  But then, I guess you have to give the answers you want to hear to Crimson Education and have people pay however much money for special tutoring to get the answers (that's a most revered University of Auckland start-up, Crimson Education.  it's all very very very very private say the courts.  Cases against Crimson Education seem to have been granted suppression ordered by teh courts so that the public doesn't know the extent of the... psychopathy...  Where the University of Auckland, where Univesrity of Auckland employees are using information they obtain in their status as employees to make a little money on it in the private market)...  They're all criminal degenerates down here, people.  Nothing to see.   </p>

                                <p>So, destination New Zealand all you Harvard Grads!  Come to NZ and do anyting anything anything anything anyting for cheapity cheap cheap cheap.  It isn't like tehy treat each other any better in tehse parts.  May was well come nd join in on the fun!  It isnt' like you would be doing anyting to them that they woldnt' do to you if they had opportunity.  Right?  Right, then.  They will not educate and train their own workforce.  There for the taking.</p>

                                <p>--</p>

                                <p>It is now 7:51pm on a Saturday.  You know what I just saw, turning at a Quay Street intersection (Central or downtown Auckland)?  A motor vehicle with very clear 'Hamilton City Council' also 'Downer' branding.  Now, what possible business could the Hamilton City Council or Downer have on Quay Street in Auckland on a Saturday evening?  And tell me, who gets the tax breaks on the company car?  Who pays for petrol?  Who is paying for the insurance, if the car is involved in some kind or sort of an accident?  The Hamilton City Ratepayer, is it?  And who, then, was driving that car, with gas provided by who, under whose insurance? We don't see any corruption.  F*cking gouge all the f*cking eyes out.  Blatant f*cking..  Singing triumphant songs whiile they are marched off for slaughter.  The complete and utter disregard for how the people will perceive it.  Who is going to do what about it?  Various 'Justices' (actually 'Injustices') hauled out of retirement (ones who would never have been appointed on their actual f*cking merits) because they don't actually have anything to lose.  Suicide kamakazee bombers...  You go Injustice Toogood!!! You go Injustice Mander!!! See if someone will remove you the good old fashioned way that they are required to do since the judiciary no work-y in New Zealand...</p>

                                <p>The outcome of the election is obvious (foregone, dare I say).  Chris Hipkins will accumlate the ire or wrath of the people and then some 'last minute' 'dark horse' will be expected to emerge as the lesser of all evils otherwise known as the only actual option or alternative (that's what option or alterntive means, it means only game in town).  Maybe Chloe Swarbrick?  Maybe Andrew Little?  Maybe some other backbencher..  Maybe someone sent from the UK or the USA to ensure that all the resources are promptly shipped where they go (northern hemisphere) while the criminals and convicts and utterly incopmetent go this way.  I can't think of a better way to prevent and prohibit developmetn for as long as possible?  Can you?  Let's all brainstorm...  Once it's been conceived of then we can all work towards it's actualisation...  What a worthwhile thing to do with our lives!!!  Yay, New Zealand!!! You lead the world in upside down and back to front!!! you go!!!!</p>

                                <p>I suppose the idea is that the 2 year master of whatever it was (leadership?) in the name of Jacinda Ardern Legacy programme at Harvard is to go to..  LIttle Nieve.  Or Naieve, or whatever her name is.  Now?  She's 6 ish.  But I"m sure she's an absolute prodigy.  I'm sure that Chris Whelan will agree!! She should be enrolled in alllll the AUT degrees.  Immediately!!!!  How old does she need to be to take up her 2 year Masters in.   Uh.  What was it again, Jacinda?  No matter how she does in school.  No matter how many kids she murders etc etc.  Is there anything she can do to alter the trajectory that has been decided for her?  Oh me, oh my!!! Hostages of us all!!!!</p>

                                <p>Apparently one teenager dies of meningitis after choosing not to be vaccinated..  So now her parents want to force everyone to be vaccinated.  Of course.  I mean, the 'security guards' or military people or the gangsters or managers or administrators in the hospital can't possibly be expected to diagnose and treat something like that in a timely fashion.  And they will never ever ever ever need to if only we can vaccinate everyone in the entire world then there wont be any cases or need for them to.  And don't worry about any of the harms caused by the vaccination.  We don't believe in that.  Rubbish rubbish pooh pooh.  There aren't any harm arising from.   I don't know..  Mixing expired vaccine with expired anasthetic solution..  I mean, nobody ever died of that.  And the highly trained health professionals of Australasia would never do such things.  Of course.  Not voluntarily.  We should just needle stick everyone with who knows what just because we can.  In the name of Medicine!  Line them all up.  Get them used to regular shots.  That's a terrific idea/l.  We could give them birth control or euthanasia or whatever the governmetn has decided is right for you.  Or whatever whatever and just see what happens.  I would totally trust a system that is incable of keeping accurate health records.  Wouldn't you?  A system that seems incapable of keeping accurate hospital records.  Incapable of keeping accurate medication charts.  Incapable of hiring medical doctors vs hiring frauds who apparently faked credentials and qualifications.  I would totally trust a system that refuses to supply applications, refuses to hire qualified candidates, chooses (only) to hire hoaxes and frauds..  Yeah..  Right.  That's a great idea!  Compulsory shots for everyone!!!</p>

                                <p>After all the work that Helen Clarke did ensuring that New Zealand was the *go to* the real *destination* place for child abuse she is very well regarded internationally, we are supposed to believe.  So, I'm sure Jacinda Ardern won't have any trouble at all being well regarded for all the work she did passing various laws (in the stealth of the night) under urgency!  emergency!  urgency!  Good of her to let the people of Harvard know about the legalisation of abortion in New Zealand (not too hard for them to look up how nobody was ever prosecuted for having performed one even when it was a crime).  That way New Zealand can be a destination for anybody wanting to 'research' or, more to the point, breed an underclass.  Nobody, to the  best of my knowledge has ever been trying to breed an over-class or a superman race or anything like that.  People don't desire to make something better than themself.  They are more interested in breeding an underclass of underlings.  Real knock-outs.  To see what will happen, if nothing else.  To create something relatively simple that only they can fix, in the best case scenario.  Right?  Breed an antibiotic resistent bacteria that only you have the cure for?  Right?  Hold the world to ransom?  Who wouldn't want that?  If only they could get away with it!  It's the very definition of 'win-win'.  Right?</p>

                                <p>I suppose the idea is to do the whole 'how low can we go' and 'there is no alternative' to see how few votes they can actually get.  While still telling the world that this prison camp is pretending to be a 'democracy'.  The little prison island off the coast of Australia (don't worry, the Australian Constitution doesn't apply to Australia it's all entirely optional they get to pick and choose which parts they want to honor and they don't feel like acknowledging NZ as a state of Australia therefore no voting papers for the NZers.  They wouldn't vote anyway.  Right?  I mean they have this 'option' and that 'option'.  It's like 'my way' or 'the highway'.  It's like 'do you want to eat your vegetables before your meat or after you meat?'  You want your euthanasia shot (all voluntary-like) now, or a little bit later?  Your taser to the brain now, or tomorrow?  You want to march off to the death camp by yourself or you want us to get a court order?  You want to stop campaigning for election or go to Mt Eden?  You want to spread your legs for Chris Hipkins, Minister of everything?  Or you want to vote for the party who thought that there was no better candidate than Uffindell?  Oh me oh my the 'choices' we have in 'you have been volunterred' land.</p>

                                <p>I don't know if Jacinda's response to the Christchurch Terrorist attack was scriped by her -- or someone else.  It was a good response.  In the short term.  Of course when it came to a more systematic or systemic or sustained response..  Providing better support for refugees and so on...  That was not forthcoming.  Then the idea seemed to be..  How can we make or find or breed more of them? Terrorists.  Because they make the politicians look good.  Right?  What's that Biden?  After a kid shoots up a school everybody in the neighbourhood will cue up for hours and hours and hours to shake your hand and listen in rapt awe for a compassionate speech from you.  I see why leaders of nations can be or become very addicted to having their population or people kept in a fairly permanent and ongoing state of trauma and shock and urgency!  urgency!  it's an emergency!  no time to think or plan (no accountabiltiy later we were only doing the best we could under conditions of urgency emergency) no time to actually listen just roll out whatever you want as quickly as you can...  Urgency!  emergency!  quicklky quickly quickly!  New Zealand has never met the quota that we are supposed to meet on refugees.  Correct?  Never?  But, of course, we rely on Australia to ship the ones of Australia's choosing.  Us being a state of Australia, and all.  A prison camp of Australia no less.  Because that's how they choose to govern Australasian lands, as best as I can see.  It takes the rocks from out of the ground and it hands them over.  It doesn't have the willingness or ability to educate or train anybody in anything at all.  Cry cry cry cry cry for satellites and submarines...  Just hand the intellectual property over...  Nothing to see here, people, nothing nothing nothing at all.  What people?  Why would we think they would count the vote?  There is no alternative...  They stopped paying the teachers.  They stopped graduating people from Uni.  They stopped paying people to work skilled jobs.  Only criminals and offenders from teh northern hemisphere need apply.  Most valued.  Then we don't pay them.  They can pay us they can pay us they can pay us they can pay us.  So many jobs simply pay for themselves.  Once you make money on pimping the kids out.  Etc.  Don't forget to spread your legs for the Rt Hon Chris Hipkins!  Minister of everything!  A man with a vision.  The pipeline from education prison to quarantine prison.  Even health prison. It's all the same, right Chris?  Urgency.  Urgency.  Emergency.  Allll of the portfolios for you Chris.  Only game in town.</p>

                                <p>The worst thing about the Australian National University (and the Univeristy of Waikato's aspirational ideal to be a second rate imitator) isn't how they treated me, at the time.  Refusing to acknowledge my work.  Refusing to get it to externals so as to prevent and prohibit timely completion of graduate research.  The worst of it is how they choose to treat me now.  Today.</p>

                                <p>They refuse to accept that I have laid a complaint with them.  They just refuse to accept it.  The Australian National University says 'in order for you to lodge a complaint you need to do x and y and z'.  They just make up stuff.  And then, when you do what they tell you to do, they deny that you have done it.  Revise and resubmit your complaint, Ms Roe.  We don't accept your complaint Ms Roe.  Revise and resubmit your complaint Ms Roe.  How many complaints do they receive?  Let me guess, sinc Chris Whelan's job (as CE of the NZVCC) is obviously and clearly to ensure that New Zealand Universities are second rate imitators of Australian Universities and since Chris Whelan refuses to acknowledge that he has received any complaints (when his statutory function is to progress complaints) they probably say they have never ever ever ever ever received a single complaint from a student about the University's refusal to process or misprocessing of research.  </p>

                                <p>The Vice Chancellor of the Australian National University was informed.  He kept telling me that I needed to complain to x or y or z person.  I mean to say the buck stops with him.  It wasn't that he intentionally employed underlings incapable of doing their job and he is ignorant of the complaints they have recieved.  He received my complaint and he chose to blow me off.  </p>

                                <p>What is the problem?  The problem is that they are not properly handling (1) enrolments (2) progressions (3) completions of graduate research (also likely undergraduate) qualifications.  THey will not do their job of supervising grduate research students (helping them get their thesis done in a timely fashion).  They think their job is to stabotage and undermine and so on.  Then they don't get the studnets research out for external examiantion.  They bully the studnet into doing a lot of work in excess of the requirements for the qualification.  I thought it was limited to heavy handed bullying.  But my experience with the Univesrity of Waikato shows everyone the lengths they will go to if you don't do what they are trying to bully you into doing.  I meant to say, they went to far as to deny that I had shipped them a thesis I have track and trace signed delivery evidence of them having received, and to refuse to get the theis they had been shipped out for external examiantion.  To this day, they never sent the thesis of 14 September 2018 out to external examiners for it to be externally examined so as to prevent any possibility of the examiners signing that it was to be accepted which would have meant I would have completed the 120 point qualification without re-enrolment being required.</p>

                                <p>During the relatively early years of lockdown (Maybe it was 2019 or 2020) the students in England (who were preparing to sit their Cambridge Exams) were told that they likely wouldn't get to sit the exams. The studnets were distraught.  Their selection into University was dependent on their examination performance, they had been led to believe.  That was why they were paying however much money they were paying to sit the examinations.  That was why some of them were workign so hard on learning curriculum contents.  Oh, don't worry, the University people said.  We already know who is going to be sent offers and that is quite indepndent from examination scores.  We don't need the examination scores to know which students we prefer.  It doesn't upset anything at all that the kids can't sit their Cambridge Exams this year.  In fact, we can simply allocate high Cambridge Exam scores to the people we have already selected for this and that University, and lower ones to the people we have selected for this other University, and you don't need to sit your exams at all!</p>

                                <p>Who wants to pay money to sit Cambridge Exams?  Now, that appears to be a system with integrity.  In upside down and back to front land.  Wouldn't you say? </p>

                                <p>So you can understand that when the University of Auckland and Otago say you haven't been selected to Medicine because you rank order score was not high enough..  What they mean to say was that they did not choose you therefore they bumped you down the rank order score.  Or, if they couldn't bump you down the rank order score enough (because they don't have enoguh control over the rank order scores with their control over the interview which apparently gives them the power of 'definite no' or 'definite yes' according to Peter Crampton and friends in print) then they can simply throw away your application and say you were declared 'ineligible' (that's what in fact Peter Crampton and friends were doing with them).  Else they can simply refuse to supply you with an application.  Get Andrea Howard to refuse to supply one.  Tell the IT people to lock certain candidates out of being able to submit an application to ensure that they do not get selected.  I can't see why they would need to remove applications if they were not...  Afraid?  That the applicant was a genuine contender.  That doesn't really make any sense now, does it?</p>

                                <p>The University of Auckland told me I was not accepted to study Medicine in 2019 because my rank order score was not high enough for me to be selected.  That is what they chose to tell me.  With a little note that they suggest I get support for my mental health since it must be very upsetting to me to learn I wasnt' academically strong enough.  When I asked them to check their math because I believe they made a mistake they supplied information to me as to how they had calculated my GPA.  I informed them that the way they calculated it was different from how they had published that they were going to calcualate GPA's.  In particular, they had used 'worst 120 points of study' in a year when they promised to use the 'best 120 points of study' if you did more than 120 points in a year (including summer school papers above stage one) and they used a part time year instead of the most recent full time year.  I mean to say, if you record that a 120 point Masters thesis took 2 academic years and 1 summer school period of enrolment, then you have in fact forced the student into less than 120 points credit over the first year in order for there to be any points remaining to distribute over the summer school and second academic year enrolment period.  They eventually agreed that they way tehy calculated it was not in accordance with their algorithm.  I supplied them with a calculation that was in accordance with their algorithm and they said that it didn't matter because they declared me 'ineligible to have applied'</p>

                                <p>I mean to say that the University of Auckland is not making decisions about who to enrol (and who not to enrol) in MBChB on academic grounds, at all.  They are not at all being fair.  They are refusing to calculte GPA's in accordance with their published algorithm at all.  They are not even trying to be fair.  What is worse is that they refused to sort this out in house.  They had plenty of time and opportunity to correct their wrong and offer me enrolment.  But they refused to do that, instead sending offers to other candidates.  They then refused to do things properly again in 2020 and decided to spend a bunch of money hiring a law firm to defend their inability or unwillingness to follow their published selection criterion for the purposes of their accountability with the courts after their in house counsel missed a filing deadline and I requested judgment proceed in their absence.  The courts chose to grant them extensions so they could get an external firm to do their filings properly.  So far the courts have delivered the judgment that the University of Auckland can do whatever it wants with complete and utter immunity.  They aren't responsble for anything or accountable for anything.  Justice Fitzgerald found that Auckland does not have the power to deem applicants 'ineligible' since the Statute says that domestic adults are 'eligible'.  But she provided no consequences for them having deemed me 'ineligible' when tehy did not have authority to do that.  And she failed to order them to calculate my GPA in accordance with the algorithm and enrol me in teh progamme (or not) on the basis of my correctly calculted rank order score.  She refused to award costs against them and some kind of damages to me for the University's blatant refusal to do it's f*cking job.</p>

                                <p>I guess this is so we understand the lengths that the Universities and Courts go to to ensure that Dr Leeks and the like will be the only game in town in New Zealand hospitals.  Before Harlene Hays set off on her mission to go ruin the University of Western Australia now, she refused to graduate more than 1/3rd the Medical Class.  Right?  Said that she did not accept the evidence that they supplied of being signed off as having completed their internships.  She simply refused dto accept tht.  The students were told that the Junior Doctor positons they were supposed to be taking up at the DHB's up and down NZ the following year were still there for them.  But they were going to be kept enrolled in the University and they were going to be kept paying fees to the University for continued re-enrolment and they were going to be passing themselves off as Junior Doctors in the hospitals but the University was going to refuse to acknowledge that they had completed the MBChB.  Welcome to the slave camp detention facility refusal to have an education and training programme land.  What's supposed to happen?  Well, there are various people (Justice Toogood, say) who has had lucrative governmetn payroll for 40++ years who think that the next generation or two should simply be marched off to death camps or serve as slaves or whatever so that he can never retire.  All of the money for them to refuse to train a new generation.  All of the money for htem to refuse to do any of the things that is in tehir actual job description.  What research outputs?  Where are all the theses?</p>

                                <p>The University of Waikato acknowledges that I compeleted a MA thesis with them.  Where is it?  It is not in the department repository.  My former supervisor sent it to me saying he thought I shuold have it.  Why?  I wrote it.  It was supposed to be lodged in the department thesis repository for the information of future students.  The University of Waikato is refusing to acknowledge research that is being done within teh University.  The people on payroll to research output..  What?  5,000 words of research every 2 years?  Every 5 years?  I understand, now, that academia itself takes research from some slaves and reattributes authorship of that research to other people.  You wouldn't expect the likes of Princeton to traffick in stealing research from Australaia, say, and passing it off as their own students work or ever the work of their Professors, right?  But that appears to be how low they go with the hiring decisions they choose to make.  Who wants to teach?  You can take your students work and pass it off as your own.  Then fail the students out so they won't find out what you have done.  Tell them they are too garbage.  Who wants to be an editor of a journal?  Take the submissions and reattribute them once the studnets have been bullied into fleeing the Univesrity with no credit.  It's just a scummy scummy scam is what it is.  It wouldnt' matter quite so much if you didin't need a degree to do something like law or medicine or engineering.  Oh, what's that?  They will never pay you to do any of those things if you have qualifications in the field.  Silly silly girl.  Didn't you know our hospitals, particularly, are 'staffed' by people who pay teh governmetn anything anything anything to play doctors and nurses for 10 days or whatever it is.  The likes of Dr Leeks.  The Glue Factory they have going on down in Dunedin.  The reason they won't process my application because I would stand up to the likes of Professor Glue.  Dr Leeks 2.0.</p>

                                <p>Dr Leeks!  All heil.  When will the monument in his honor be built? The monument so that he can reflect on how he had such an impactful life.  His victims will never forget.  Right?  That's the goal the purpose the aim the point.  Many of the kids he were sent had clear and obvious capacity and potential.  That's the truth of it.  And his job was to take them out.  Eliminte them.  So that certain other people's children were the only game in town.  The only candidate.  Because it's soooooo competitive.  The aim of Medicine being to kill and maim and harm and destroy.  Of course.  Clearly.  It's soooo cmoeptitive how could things be any other way?  The courts can get off their arses to order child uplifts before the evidnce is even in.  Before expert testimony for the other side can be heard (for a change).  In New Zealand 'Medical expert testimony' only ever means 'my way or the highway' by peple who were most emphaticlly NOT selected in virtue of their place on a rank order score list.  Corruption.  It's like they've had their eyes gouged out.</p>

                                <p>So, probably the scummy scam goes something like this...  1/3rd of the kids are offered Junior Doctor positions (for low to no pay since their NZ qualifications are not acknowledged in NZ -- which is what they started doing with the teachers near the start of Labors first current term).  The ones who are graduated likely were not offered positions.  So, they won't be doing Junior Doctor years in the hospitals, at all.  Not sure how many children of the administration are actually signed off as having completed and given paid junior doctor positions.  Maybe they need to have parents on the DHB of the hospital, specifically.  They ever find that guy who allegedly murdered his DHB board member wife to go live with his hooker?  Or did him and his wife both run off to live from the insurance money, or whatever they were up to.  What reason is there to believe that she died?</p>

                                <p>I wonder how much money you pay to play Orthopedics for 10 days before your wife gets to spend a lifetime in Hillmorton (apparently not in her interests to appear before the courts) and his children.  Well, what reason do we have to believe they are dead?  What happened to them before they died?  Were they really his chidren or was he traficking them in exhange for getting to play Doctors and Nurses in the hospitals for 10 days?  Why would we think the guy who killed the teenager who was going to tell everyone he was giving them drugs (from the hospital?) and sexually molesting them..  Why would we think he died in jail?  Why would we think that there wasn't a monmument erected in his honor someplace and he's gone off to help Harlene ruin Western Australia?  We are supposed to believe they don't have class roll lists in the cadavar laboratory?  How could anybody believe that he forged his way onto the class list?  How many kids per cadavar?  That was supposed to be one of the things limiting the number of new students enrolled in that programme.  His group would have had one extra student in it who was not on the class roll.  So, what happened?  Oh, when it was time to pay him for his work in the hospital they decided they would imprison him instead.  We will not pay doctors to work in the hospitals.  What education and training system?  F*cking psychopaths.  There's nothing there.  F*cking psychopaths.  Won't even process an application to enrol.  Won't even publically advertise jobs.  Ashley Bloomfield is Professor now?  He never even applied to study PhD.  He never wrote a PhD.  He never graduated with a PhD.  He is a 'doctor' in virtue of MBChB but they certainly will not pay him anything at all to work as a doctor in the f*cking hospital.  Or Ayesha.  Shane Reti is working only the most minimum hours required for registration only.  As a GP?  All his patients can only see him for 1 or is it 3 weeks of the year?  What a f*cking farce.</p>

                                <p>It does not matter what any of the laws are becuase the courts simply refuse to uphold them.  Won't do it.  So it doesn't matter what the laws are.  The Statutes are very very clear.  Relatively simple.  It's not f*cking rocket science.  It's not supposed to be.  And the Judges simply refuse to read and write and understand plain English.  Full of excuses and delays.  While they expediate judgment quickly quickly quickly on other cases before expert testimony comes in.  They refuse to uphold the law.  Nobody home.  NOthing here.  Just so the people understand the function of Meidcine and Law and things like that.  To oppress the people.  Engineering.  Buildings intentionally designed to be not fit for purpose by design.  Intentionally designing buildings so that it is not possible for things to be humane.  Intentionally going out of their way to ensure that they are not fit for purpose by design.  So that no actual doctors would ever apply to work in the hospitals etc, of course.  Since the whole goal or aim or purpose or point is to make money off the proceeds of crimes traffickign children for sex offenses adn the like.  Right Dr Leeks?  That's why we feed teenagers horse tranquiliser Dr Glue?  Sourced from teh hospital or vet science or somewhere else?  Who have the University of AUckland permission to manufacture LSD so they could feed that to people (and not keep accurte medical records) in the name of calling tehm psyhcotic and lockign them up and throwing away the key?  Is that the great plan?  I see now why they threw away my Masters thesis.  About how to help people with delusion.  The point of psychiatary isn't to help people it is to gaslight and undermine and oppress and so on.  That's the whole goal point aim or purpose.  Why?  Why, so the likes of Dr Leeks and Dr Glue and Justice Toogood can pat themselves on the back that they were the only qualified applicant for that job and allll of the money for them.  Alllll of of the money for them.  Alllll of the money for them.</p>

                                <p>Since the NZ governmetn will not prosecute corruption it makes NZ the natural magnet or choice for all the offenders out there.  Particularly child abusers.  Quite the destination. Who wants to work in pediatrics?  In teh schools?  We won't sign off on anybody unless they are a known offender with a plan as to how to make money pimping the children out, no doubt.  That way we don't need to opay them.  We don't needto pay Dr Leeks or Chris Whelan.  Right?  THe can make their money pimping the children out.  We don't need to pay Stuart McCutcheon -- right?  How much do you need to pay the Univesrity of AUckland to..  I don't know..  Rape a first year student with complete and utter immunity?  How many of those did he need to arrange per year to justify his salary do you think?  I suppose that makes sense of why they keep a tight reign on Psychiatry there (no prescription charts) so they can silence anybody who wants to speak out about the University of Auckland.  No complaints, right Chris Whelan?  Quarter of a Million for you!  What was the youngest studnet in AUT?  I mean, the Statute says 16 but don't let that stop you.  14 year old Vietnamese student in Finance?  Who came her with her 'guardian' (not mother) no less.  HOw many of those per year for your salary to pay for itself?  No complaints, right Chris?  It's okay.  The courts have determined that since you write the law (you do not) you are not subject to the law.  You can do anything you want with impunity says the judge hauled of retirement to output complete and utter garbage for half a million per year no doubt.  We don't see any corruption.  No corruption at all.  Don't get sick now, y' hear!!</p>

                                <p>And Australia seems to have shut it's f*cking yap about there being a vote to re-write the constitution to have Aboriginal Australaians formally acknowledged. See, the thinking would have been that the threshold on changing the constitution is high enough such that the general apathy from most Australians will mean that they will not vote to change the constitution.  Which will be a nice little racist message that the government can send about how it's the people's fault tha they are racist and there isnt' anything the governmetn can do.  Except 'the jig is up' rather, really, once you realise that NZ is written into the Australian Constitution as a state of New Zealdn and, of course, general apathy means that no vote occurrred to remove it from being a State.  And, really, why would the NZ people want not to be a state of Australia?  Since we constantly hear how wages are lower in NZ and we don't have access to basic medicines that are available in NZ and so on.  Apparently their education system is better than ours.  Because teh Australian National University can't process applications to enrol on the basis of academic merits.  That's how amazing Australian Institutions are.  With Harlene Hayes rolling out the 'we refuse to graduate you' plan to Western Australia, now, to ensure that there aren't any Medical Doctors.  I don't suppose there are any lawyers who can read.  I mean, NZ is obviously written into the Australian Constitution as a state.  But tehy refuse to supply voting papers.  I don't know what their basic reading programme is.. I suspect the problem is something different, entirely.  F*cking psychoapths.  That's for f*cking sure.</p>

                                <p>So.  Work hard in school kids!  Yeah, right!  Go along to school now and eat your lunch.  That's why we go to the Australian National University.  Right?  So we can have morning tea together.  To eat our lunch.  It surely isn't so that your academic work can be progressed in a timely fashion.  Or if they are too stupid or lazy or psychoapthic or busy or whatever to do the job for which they are paid (supervise their student) then at least get out of the f*cking way.  Write a little note to the external examienrs if they feel the need to 'sorry my studnets work is in this state but I was too stupid or lazy or psychopathic or busy or whatever it was to help them at all so it's up to you now externl examiner to give them the concrete changes they need to do to get it done in a timely fashion'.  F*cking psychopaths.  Sterelny chose to write 'The Evolved Apprentive' funded, I believe, by the French Government?  Instead of supervising various of his studnets.  So they could go on to erect vast momuments in his honor about how he was too f*cking psychopathic to do his f*cking job when it came to helping his students complete their aprpenticeships in a timely fashion.  What did Sterelny have to teach us?  I imagine it was a little something something about how you take work from x and then you credit it to y.  Maybe that's how the bulk of his work got done.  I suspect that is probably it.  Why he said he refused to acknowledge anytihng he wrote more than 5 years ago.  By that he means to say he treats the output of others as abandonware if they did not get formal recognition for having done it within 5 years it was given to someone else to take credit for it.  And, I would imagine people don't want to have to explain things that they did not even write that were credited to them as them having written when they stole it more than 5 years ago.</p>

                                <p>I think that is the best reason why they are refusing to acknowledge my work.  Because others have passed it off as their own since they did not acknowlwedge it as mine within 5 years.  That's why they are so determined to bully me away now.  That's the best expalnation or eason that I can see.  That's why you are supposed to not show work you have submitted to journals more widely.  THey hold up the peer review process until you have been bullied away then they can credit it to someone else.  David Lumsden was not very productive as a researcher.  I think that's why they hired him.  He was supposed to encourage studnets to work extra slowly and pay more and more and more and more and more moey to the University in fees, or something like that.  THey acknoweldged his work output as about 5,000 words every 2 or 5 years, I think.  So he could put a little footnote in his work about the students who had not been credited with the work tha tthe students had done.  The idea was that his studnets did not have their work on the topic published.  Instead, he got something published on the topic about 2 or 5 years after those studnets were bullied away.  See why they pay him? To take the work and hand it over to others so they can pass it off as their own.  That was the whole poitn of 'Turnitin'.  Handing over the research output of Australasia, particularly, sot hat studnets and professors of the Ivy League Institutions in the USA, primarily, could take credit for it.  And the rubbish in Australasia could rot.  Of course.  I guess that's what happens when you don't select students on the basis of ability.  Abilty to steal the outputs of others.  That ability.  I suppose.  That's how come it's easy to re-deploy them into other positons.  I guess.  They can go manage everything mewards in any field or whatever.  Just redeploy them to go ruin this field or that field or the other field.  Go mismanage the health system the education system the judiciary.  There really is nothing here.  The psychopaths took over.  Right Sterelny?  Wouldnt' have it any other way.  I mean, you woulldn't be in the position you are in if it were not so.  That's clear.</p>

                                <p>And now of course every man and his dog is filing Judicial Review of Adminsitrative Action and the Government expediated through all of their cases and still has not delivered justice on mine.  Was it Andrew Burrowford?  WHo was given a PhD (not a JD) for all of the work that he did initiating one against Bloomfield?  Of course the reason why they have him his PhD (after one decade?  Two?) was to STOP him from taking it through the court of appeal.  I would suppose.  I mean to say, there is not teeth in the high court.  The High Court Judges seem to have the job of writing judgments that articulate very clearly how they are NOT finding in the interests of justice, at all.  They really go out of their way to word-salad and gaslight really rubbing in the injustice.  Really rubbing it in.  Apparently it is just part of the process before the Court of Appeal rides in like a big knight actually delivering justice! ! Of course the idea, then, is to refuse to accept filings and refus to progress things through the court of appel.  Refuse to accept filings.  Didn't you know?  The Judges can order indefinate number of unlimited re-filings.  Of course they can.  I mean, if the Universities can do that to prevent and prohibit research tehn of course the Courts can order refiling nad refiling.  They can evern order the case to be changed from oen that is unlosable to one that is unwinnable. Didnt' you know?  They could even remove all reference to the law in teh filings an dthen say the filings aren't accepted because tehre isnt' reference to the law.  Didn't you know?  That's what justice meeeeeeeans.  Didn't you know?  That's what makes studying the law so desirable.  Or..  No.  That's what makes it soooooo cmopetitive.  Oooh.  Ooh me ooh my.  So, do the Judges get to visit the kids they've ordered to be uplifted, on the weekends, then?  Is that the problem or the issue, here?</p>

                                <p>And now I am thinking... The supervisor finds a thesis in their trophy room of theses they have hoarded from students who have been bullied away or murdered or what have you.  And the supervisor gives a thesis to a different student.  And the student accepts the PhD on the basis of the thesis that has been given to them by their supervisor or they don't get a PhD at all.  But if this is how you got your PhD you can see how you are now most valuable and most valued employee.  You can take your students work and pass it off as your own.  Or, you can hand it over so that other studnets can pass it off as their own.  The studnets from the 'best tier' institutions, obviously, need to be credited with the best work else their university starts to look like a scummy scummy scam.  Right?  So, there we go.  The scummy scummy scam.  I mean, what else are we to think when the Universities are not getting the studnets work out to external examiners so it can be examined on it's academic merits?  Waikato was very very clear with me that they KNEW that I had the capacity to do 1 year of research in 1 year.  That that was very specifically why they were going to refuse to formally acknowledge that I'd done that.  F*cking psychopaths.  What University?  But then I don't see that the Australiain National University (Australasias Premier Research Institution) is doing any better.  THey wouldnt' get my work out to externals either.  Sterelny wrote that he thought it should go out in 3 months to the administration.  But he did not tell me that.  And the administration did not get my work out 3 months later.  f*cking psychopaths.  Psychopathy!  Yay!  I know..  Let's give Jeannette Kinette (however you spell that) yet another research grant so that she can research psychopathy by paying her to subcontract her teaching work to a studnet and never ever ever ever sign that student off.  Psychopathy 101.  Indeed.  Alll of the research funds for you.  Alllll of the research funds for you Sterelny.  Only game in town!   Alll of the everything for you and your selfish selfish selfish selfish genes.  Apparently.  Making the world worse in the name of you helping yourself.  Indeed. </p>

                                <p>Hey, thanks for hte reference Martin Davies!!!  I worked on the topic of YOUR CHOOSING. You were paid hudnreds of thousands of dollars to research delusions.  And after I supplied you with a writing sample you offered me a summer scholarship to work with you on delusions.  SO I did did the readings you set me (all of them) and attended all the meetings you requested with me (weekly meetings, I attended all of them).  And I did my prep (did the readings and gave you writings by the deadline you set) all summer.  And I wrote a 50 minute seminar presentation talk as you requested.  And I delivered it as you requessted.  And you said (to me in private) that it was 'as good as anything that had been done, here'.  And you refused to write me a reference for PhD application.  Said that I should apply to the ANU and make everything as broad and wide as I could since you were leaving.  But you would not write me a reference.  Then I write a PhD for the ANU.  And I do everything that people on my panel and my supervisor asks me to do.  Everything that they ask me to do.  And they refuse to help me with the work.  They don't request meetings.  They don't comment on writings that I give them.  They don't get my work to externals.  They collect up all of the research money for themselves and they are horrible psychopathic bullies.  No I don't want to house-sit for you.  You are f*cking paid well enough to f*cking pay someone to do it.  F*ck you.  Worst hire ever.  Why the hell woudl someone go to teh ANU to work with Sterelny when they could have stayed in Wellington WEllington Wellington Wells.  Oh.  THey wanted to swap Sterelny with Richard Joyce since Joyce took a liking to sleeping with his graduate research studnets in the office and then refusing to get their work to externals.. He's the perfect fit for Wellington Wellington Wellington Wells.  No doubt.  Just so we can udnerstand why there is no research output in NZ Universities.</p>

                                <p>It's the desitnation to do all the research that ethics boards would not approve overseas.  particularly anything involving child abuse.  NZ is renowned for it.  Right?  It's all 'socially normal' in these parts.  We need to ensure that people are documetned as treating their kids very very badly indeed so then we don't need to feel bad about taking their kids and treating them comparably.  Of course, the parents often were askking for help..  But there is no help lin NZ.  It's all sooooo competitive.  The aim is to take out weaken sicken destroy maim.  It's all soooo cmopetitive.  Not because there are too many people...  The problem is something very very different entirely.  I would imagine that the most competitive situation of all woudl be when you are in the midst of a genocide.  Something like that.  That is, I suppose, why we don't acknowledge 'New Zealander' as a group.  Because I think the idea is to annihiliate the New Zealanders and declare New Zealnd terra nullus or whatever.  Prison detention camp of the Northern Hemisphere. Everyone here is a criminal psychopath violenlt offender.  So it's justified that they do their knock out baby studies etc etc in thse parts.  With complete impunity.  The courts don't function.  Of course.  And so on.</p>

                                <p>I mean, I guess the idea is..  If the governmetn is making a bunch of money off of 'edu-tourism' of the 'you pay us $100,000 and give us your 2 daughters and wife to do anytying anyting we want with and in return we will pretend you are orthopedic surgeon in the christchurch hospital for 10 days and you can do anything anything in the name of that' then you really need to ensure that there aren't any actual orthopedic surgeons to speak up about this guy being a fraud or a hoax or an impostor.  I mean to say the quality of the education and training progarmme needs to be kept such that the people in it and the graduates of it can't tell the difference.  Else, for things to be kept sooooo oppressive that nobody would speak up.  I guess because if yuo speak up then it's off to the prisons for you.  Where tehy will then say that it isn't in your interests to appear before the judge who was hauled out of retirement precisely for the occasion.  Maybe he likes to visit you on the weekends?  Is that the idea?  I eman..  I am really struggling to come to terms with just how corrupt things are or may  be in NZ..  When the Universities simply refuse to put things right internally and snigger when they tell you to try taking things through the courts if you have a problem, then.  I mean to say the universities have the utmost of confidence or faith in the inability or unwillingness of the courts to deliver justice in a timely fashion.  There is nothing in Australasia.  Or likely anyplace else.  Hard to tell.  the UK was pretty blatent about the Cambridge Curriculum being a hoax or a scam or a sham.  Never stop paying!  NEver stop paying!  NEver stop paying them to administer everything me-wards!  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                                <p>Of course they snigger becuase of the obviousness of Sterelny's proclamation that it must 'always be costly to punish'.  That way the psychopaths prevail.  So, of course, the courts never award the full amount of costs to the party who has been wronged by the psychopaths.  That way it is always costly to punish the psychoapths.  You see?  And of course it isn't just about the costs.  The schedule 2B costs, I mean to say.  The costs that are supposed to be awarded to punish unnecessary steps in the proceedings (like a QC choosing to file a motion to have proceedings stuck out when it was obvious to all parties that documentation of wrongdoing had been clearly supplied to the courts).  The courts won't award the full amount of legal costs.  Because they will not pay lawyers.  The courts won't award damages.  Because they aren't really 'courts'.  There aren't any 'judges'.  It's just a f*cking scam of a farce of a hoax.  There's nothing here.  Australasia chooses to govern, still, like a prison camp colony.  Australasia chooses to conduct itself like the Stanford Prison Experiimetn where people are arbitrarily divided into 'overlords' and 'oppressed' and where the only actual requisite for being overlord is getting off on oppressing others.  You don't want to have a slave colony of your own?  Then you get to be oppressed.  Congradulations.  You didn't want to play our stupid psychopath game. We don't choooooose you.  Right.  For all the qualities it is that they value.  Nasty .  Bruitish and shot.  RIP Stuart McCutcheon.  Of course I doubt he's actually dead.  Open casket funeral so people can (grief stricken of course) take some nail scrapings of DNA from the casket and his son?  Course not.  For obvious reaons.</p>

                                <p>The courts cry cry cry cry cry that they have too many filings to process.  But the only reason there is so many filings is because the judges request more and more and more filings.  It is a problem of their own making, I mean to say.  During the Covid Lockdown there were no new jury trials.  That means the courts have the opportunity to clear the backlog of cases that they have, particularly civil cases that do not require a jury.  So, what did the courts do during the lockdown?  They cry cry cry cry cry about how the lockdown means that they can't process or progress civil cases.  They can only demand re-filings and re-filings and re-filings and re-filings. Not a legal system, eh?  How can anybody do business in this jurisdiction?  Apparently nobody in business thinks that there is any purpose or function or whatever to the courts.  That is or means to say there are other mechanisms for..  Figuring out what is just or right or whatever in business interactions or transactions.  Yeah, right.  I call 'bullsh*t'.  There's actually nothing here.  I guess because they wouldn't process applications to law school, progressions.  Wouldn't develop a curriculum that was useful or good.  I don't know how you teach case law when the judges are some combination of on the take and / or incompetent most of the time.  When you don't graduate students from Law.  When you arrange for them to be sexually molested during their internships.  Practice for their clerkships, was that?  Or a heads-up on what they would be required to do for a position in a firm?  Is that the idea?  Maybe in order to get registration?  Corruption.  Things are too corrupt in these lands.  I don't see how it is possible for anybody to function.  Apparently if I shut up that will help.  Riiiiight.  If you take a look at my writing over on the writing page and so on you will see that I put up with really rather  lot (and did really rather a lot of traditionl work) before I was basically forced to turn to understanding that the psychopathic bullies weren't allowing me to function on...  Political grounds?   Because it's all sooooooo competitive that by the time they have taken everything they believe they are entitled to (and made the f*cking arbitrary decisions that make them feel powerful) there is nothing left for me.  How f*cking hard can it be to forward my work to external examiners?  The courtesy you showed to every other applicant?  Or..  I don't know...  Carl Brusse was required to work for 10+  years and write at least 2 PhD's on 2 different topics (so Princeton had the first one for their trophy room, I believe)...  But they did give him his PhD eventually.  I believe.  But I don't know how many times he house-sat for Kim Sterelny.  That must have been it...  Oh, he was fun at parties, I think Kim Sterelny enjoyed his company at morning and afternoon tea.  He was fun to travel with, I suppose? </p>

                                <p>So, Jacinda Arderns legacy.  (1)  I think pretty much everybody thought the way she responded to the terrorist attack was just what was needed.  'Be kind'.  That was the message that the people of NZ needed to hear.  Because of how we are kept in such conditions of punative abuse and oppression.  It's sooooo competitive and people are soooo f*cking nasty to one another.  Abusive bullies.  Not kind at all.  That's right.  The initial 'stay home' lock-down was most welcome.  Because people were about dropping dead with exhaustion, many of them.  F*cking killing themselves in their 'high value' jobs.  Smearing feces on the walls of their law firm bathrooms and so on.  (2)  Addicted to urgency emergency urgency all eyes on me awwwwww be kind New Zealand.  It's starting to sound condescending now.  Wake up to the prison camp that is New Zealand, everybody.  How everybody is the opposite of kind.  It's sooooooo competitive.  (3)  How many terrorists can we find?  Tamaki is an obvious threat.  Mt Eden for him.  How  many others?  Let's follow this one (and not provide any of the help he obviously needs and has asked for in fact) so we can provoke him and then when he stabs someone (everybody saw that coming that was the aim goal purpose or point of following him so closely antagonising him into doing something spending all those resources on antagonising him and not even spending half those resources on helpling him in ways  he obviously and clearly needed).  So they can go 'see see' let's change a bunch of laws under urgency emergency urgency emergency let's take freedoms away from the NZ people because they are all a  bunch of terrorist violent offenders because they are in NZ therefore it must be true!  (4)  I am not going to have a baby she said.  She said she didn't believe that a woman should have to answer that question but she was not going to have a baby.  9 months later she did and her baby went with her to meeting of the UN.  I don't know if she drugged her baby to ensure it wouldn't cry...  Or maybe women's empowerment is taking a baby to work and everybody can just be 'awwwww it's a baby' and she's supposed to..  Leave?  If the baby cries?  Or everyone is supposed to stop what they are doing and wait for the baby to stop crying?  HOw is it supposed to go?  Why is she trying to sell or give babies away to the UN?  It really doesn't make any sense...  (5)  The scholarship recipient.  The Jacinda Ardern (not the 'Prime MInisters') scholarship that was created...  For a studnet to do a 2 year Masters at Harvard in the Kennedy (?) Leadership Programme or whateaver it was.  I am asking very specifically who the receipient of that scholarship was.  Why?  Because of accountability.  This is, apparently, Jacinda Arderns legacy.  Harvard was offering a NZ student a scholarship in Jacinda Arderns name.  Not a 'Prime Ministers' scholarship for a NZ student.  A 'Jacinda Ardern' scholarship for a NZ student. So who gets to pick what student?  Jacinda?  So, what studnet did she pick?  And what were her reasons for picking that studnet?  I would suggest that is a  huge part of her legacy right there.  What student she picked, and why?  I strongly suspect...  That no student did that.  I suppose they were all 'ineligible' if they acknowledged any applications as being received at all.  Otherwise, I imagine that the student who was selected was someone who was affluent enough to fund it themselves.  You know, like how Justice Toogood or Justice Palmer get sent to do their 2 year Masters in Law (not JD) at Harvard and Yale because of who their parents are.  I would imagine or suppose.  What was the reasoning for sending them?  Who funded them?  The NZ government or someone or something else?  How did Geoffery Palmer fund Justice Palmer to do a 2 year Masters at Yale?  Was that a NZ Governmetn scholarship or did Justice Palmer use his Prime Minister Salary to fudn that or something else?  Did the Jacinda Ardern scholarship receipient graduate?  I think her honorary degree was awarded around teh time when her legacy studnet should have graduated.  What is her legacy student doing now?  On NZ government payroll or something else?  Did NZ need to pay some further ransom or something to get the student back?  Were they maybe being detained in the psych ward after having been sexually molested by various other people's sons?  What was the ransom required for everyone to keep their yaps shut about that?  Who wants to go to University!!!  I mean, when they can't process applications, progressions, completions...  Slave.  Hostage.  Prison.  Detention camp.  Nobody home.  Great legacy Jacinda!!  Well done!!  What was that?  YOu never would have been democratically elected if you hadn't have cheated on your campaign.  Right.  That sort of says it all, really. </p>

                                <p>I guess, all the work that Helen Clarke did ensuring that NZ be the destination for child abuse, trafficking children for sex offenses and the like, all the work that was done legitimating or legitimising in the name of education and law and social services and so on.  Health.  The Medical 'experiments' or 'observational studies' the 'education and training programmees' the 'it's for their own good it's social services' and the like.  To make this part of the world the destination go to for sexual offenders.  No consequences for their crimes.  Statutes practically erected in their honor.  Dr Leeks etc.  All the work that the NZ government and courts, the judiciary, the 'medical profession' and 'education' and so on have done to really instititutionalise such things and say that they are just 'normal behavior' in this part of the world and these lands.  She was awarded?  Rewarded?  By international agencies and organisations?  The more she promoted NZ as the destination go to place for all the offenders of the world the more they wanted to promote her as legitimate?  I guess...  Seems so...  Maybe they will do that for Jacinda, too.  With all the work that the Labor Governmetn has done not paying the teachers and not graduating the students etc.  Writing these new NCEA exams that are soooooo bad they are trying to force parents into forking out for Cambridge Curriculum Exams even after the UK is blatent about their decisiosn about what university they want the kids in is one that is decided BEFORE they hand out the grades that were supposed to be based on examination performance (but obviously and clearly aren't).  What a f*cking farce of a hoax of a scummy scummy scam.  The worst of it isnt' how awful things are.. The worst of it is how many people are devoted to working so very very very hard to ensure that things into the future...  Will only be worse and worse and worse.  The real committment to making things be as bad as possible is really what truly astounds me.  I don't really see much in the way of 'try'.  I mean to say the situation only seems to amp up that they are more and more and more and more blatent about the nature of their crimes and their intention for things only to become worse.</p>

                                <p>It is probably the case that the whole Covid vaccination drive in NZ was just something to divert attention from them refusing to allow people to have their infants immunised.  I mean to say the rates of regular or usual infant immunisations were withheld in order to see what sort of kinds of early childhood diseases they could get occuring later.  I don't know if a similar thing happened in other countries or if New Zealand (with or without Australia) was nominated as an easy country to roll out 'no vaccinations for children' for a few years, there.  Because, that's that Chris Hipkins?  The vaccination people can only do one vaccination at a time.  It's toooooooo haaaaaaard..  Tooooooo haaaaard.  Therefore impossible.  Yeah, right.  To busy trying to force people to have things done against their will largely or mostly so that we can then claim to be far too busy doing that to do any of the things that the people are actually requesting.  Life is just so much easier if they just do whatever you say whenever you say because you say.  Right?  For as long as you get away with it.  That makes things so easy that even you can manage it!  Great!</p>
