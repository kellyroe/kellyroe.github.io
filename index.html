                        <div class="container">

                            <p> 
                                <a href="https://kellyroe.github.io/writing/realmecv.pdf">Chronological CV</a>
                             </p>

                             <p>D&D RECONCIEVED.  AKA:  WHAT WOULD JESUS DO??</p>

                             <p>Okay...  So this is a mock article-y thing.  Thingamie bob.  Whatsit.  There is this idea or a meme or whatever or whathave you of What Would Jesus Do?  Now, I bring to you, a riff, or variant on the theme.  And my riff, or variant, goes like this: What Would Dr Leeks Do?</p>

                             <p>What is the point of this?  Well..  I guess the idea is that one imagines Jesus for the 'good' or the 'kind' or the 'benevolent' or the 'psychologically mature' option.  *Good vibes*.  You get the idea.  </p>

                             <p>And I want to contrast with that...  Something else.  And there are various things I could have picked or chosen...  One of them (traditionally) would have been Satan.  But, then, I ask you to think of what hell Satan represented...  And I ask you to invisage that, as well as you can, as being something that exists upon earth.  And, well, many people have heard something of the things that Dr Leeks did or allowed to be done or arranged to have done and so on and so forth..  To children.  And I ask of you, as best you can, to empathise.  You know, show your supreme and superior emotional intelligence or power of rationality or whatever it is that allows you to project yourself into the place of the children... And to, then, consider, from their point of view...</p>

                             <p>And so now I have described to you.  The idea.  The ideology.  Of What Dr Leeks Would Do.</p>

                             <p>So we are fairly clear and all on the same page.  Now that is done and we can move on to the next step of the 'game' or 'situation' or what have you.</p>

                             <p>PART TWO:</p>

                             <p>Now I ask..  Now I ask of you..  What is it.. What is it that Dr Leeks would do...  With the game of D&D?</p>

                             <p>I put that to you.</p>

                             <p>What is it that Dr Leeks would do?</p>

                             <p>ANSWER:  FIRST PASS</p>

                             <p>Firstly, we are going to have to sexualise this game.  Voluntarily.  That is what the children want.  To play a sexualised game.  Dr's and Nurses, if you will.  The children require it.  The game will be, can be played, no other way.  </p>

                             <p>ANSWER:  FIRST PASS</p>

                             <p>Riffing on the theme of firstly...  What the children want (in fact) -- it becomes increasingly obvious to me, in my role as Psychiatrist or Clinical Psychologist or Teacher or One with All Power Over You...  Is...  Oh my god!!! It just so happens to turn out (all voluntary-like) to be everything I have ever fantisized about!  All my hopes! All my desires!  All my dreams!  Everything I have ever fantisized about!!! I should really get government funding for helping me helping me helping me help myself to them...  I feel so much better for all the play time that I have with them.  For their own good, obviously.  Their psychopathology.  They are such attention seekers, obviously!  The problem with them (insofar as they have a problem) is that they will do anything anything anyting for the highest bidder..  And ooooh I forsee a situation where someone may outbid me!  Oh noes!  They need treatment from me, clearly, to see the error of their ways...  </p>

                             <p>ANSWER:  SECOND PASS</p>

                             <p>Well, clearly the theraputic value of D&D is having people role play whatever it is that I want or require them to be.  I can simply give them characters for them to play and they can understand that their purpose and function in life (in fantasy) is only to please me.</p>

                             <p>If I want my boys to RPG girls (otherwise they are trans-phobic)...  Etc...  Etc... I want people to role-play (this is crucial) that their one goal and desire in life is to be whatever it is that I want them to be.  Really portray that they are the actual embodiement only of my desire...</p>

                             <p>D&D</p>

                             <p>Why would the children (why would anybody) want to voluntarily play that game?</p>

                             <p>Wait..  It's voluntary?</p>

                             <p>Why?</p>

                             <p>The books are kind of cool.  Interesting...  The lore..  The rolling of dice...  The basic arithmetic.  Simple things becoming increasingly complex...  There is much to love...  But of course most adults don't actually want the kids to have free reign over or in the game.  Adults love to insert themselves into childrens games and get the children playing a RPG where the only function purpose or point of the childrens lives is to do anything anyting anyting to please or placate the adult.  The biggest bully in the playground etc...</p>

                             <p>KENKU IS..</p>

                             <p>The lore says that Kenku served a great master.  Maybe a wizard.  And the master of Kenku says (this is what he says) that he learned that Kenku (a bird race) was trying to acquire the power of speech..  Because what Kenku's imagination could conceive of...  Kenku wanted to use the power of speech...  To beg for petty baubles.</p>

                             <p>And now I ask of you...  Why on earth would anyone want the power of speech..  To beg for petty baubles?</p>

                             <p>Kenku's master would have you believe...</p>

                             <p>That Kenku's master was JUSTIFIED in cursing kenku such that he had his wings ripped off so that he could no longer fly.  In mythology..  Icarus. Also...  Kenku's master was JUSTIFIED in cursing kanku such that he no longer had the power of...  ORIGINAL THOUGHT.  Kenku cannot generate novel speech.  But that is just a by-product or off-shoot of the POWER TO GENERATE ORIGINAL THOUGHT.  Kenku was cursed such that Kenku could no longer generate original thought (because he would only beg beg beg for funding, one can only suppose) so Kenkus' master felt entitled...</p>

                             <p>So..  What is Kenku to do?</p>

                             <p>CRITICAL ROLE</p>

                             <p>D&D existed prior to critical role.  Critical role popularised D&D for both better and worse.  For better..  Things became cheaper and more accessible.  For worse...  It was a game-changer, to a certain extent.  What started as..  Comedic improv...  Turned fairly quickly into highly scripted comedic improv..  I mean to say there is only so far that player choices can actually matter when someone is going to walk out a 3d model of a combat encounter.  It's in no way improv..  Right????  But the books became availble -- free online.  I mean to say books that were only in store in plastic wrappers (never in libraries) such that YOU HAD NO WAY OF ACCESSING THE CONTENT.  Those books.  Became freely available online.  But then the content of the books..  Became...  Surperfluous?</p>

                             <p>What do the books have to do with Dr Leeks (and various proxies thereof) fantasies???</p>

                             <p>PERSONA 5</p>

                             <p>Persona 5 was a *brilliant* game in so many ways.  It really speaks to me with the Jungian Psychology.  How they turned that into a thing..  Japan.  I'm super excited to see what they can and will do for Persona 6...  But I will admit I don't have high hopes when I see what they are planning on doing with Persona 3..  In my opinion, to my mind, they are focusing on the least compelling aspects.  Rather than workign to develop and extend the best aspects.  Persona 5 gave children (RP13) and teens and even adults resources...  Psychological resources...  Virtual friends...  Lines..  To mimic as one sees fit..  Where there is resonance.  To discard when not..  Ways to approach..  Handle...  Deal with.. The evils of adults.</p>

                             <p>But the fact that Persona 5 was able to reach as wide an audience as it did (in both youth and across language boundaries or borders was)..   Most likely something that..  Dr Leeks..  And all his admirors..  All his wannabees...  Will never..  So far as they can possibly help it..  Ever..  Allow... To happen again.  So..  I find it hard to see how Persona 6 will be anything other than a weakening of the franchise.  Which saddens me.  But speaks to our times.  The fact that Persona 5 made it out there the way that it did is truely remarkable.</p>

                             <p>REQUEST:  Let Unlocked Cut Scenes be Replayable from the Trophy Room.  The STory.  Let it be a Movie.  For players who have unlocked it -- at least.</p>

                             <p>And now back to D&D</p>

                             <p>Beholders...  A lesson in the evils of adults.  </p>

                             <p>The idea is supposed to be that the base game (what is in the players guide) is the most well developed and balanced.  So that players can be both different and equals.  No body made choises (or consulted build guides such that) they are the best character or only way to play or whatever.</p>

                             <p>The classes or whatever in expansions..  And particularly the monster classes as playable races are..  Still being worked out with regards to them being balanced.  So..  What would balance them.  Make them not appreciably worse such that nobody would want to play them.  Also not appreciably overpowered such that everyone would play them.  People want to say that multi-classing is overpowered compared to not multiclassing.  Maybe.  The differnece of 5 per cent stats in a game where there are not that many rolls is in fact..  More negligible than you might suppose...</p>

                             <p>If one wanted to min-max one would pay with computers and statisticians.</p>

                             <p>All heil the mighty Dr Leeks!</p>
