                <p>  https://www.stuff.co.nz/bay-of-plenty/300968095/left-to-die-alone-in-agony-hospital-bans-daughter-from-dying-mums-bedside

                Could have been worse.  They could have locked her in a hospital room, druggged her with who knows what, and refused to call the police or give her a line out to police.  They could simply tresspass anyone who presents for treatment (unless it is a politician, of course) and then they wouldn't need to hire any 'doctors' or 'nurses' or anything, really, anything at all.  </p>

                <p>The Ministry of Social Development has informed the court that 'justice no essential need' and now, one year after a substantive hearing of the issue, the social security appeals authority still has not overturned this declaration from or by the government.  The entire panel of 1+1 has refused to overturn the statement of fact.</p>

                <p>Not even trying a little bit.  Are they?</p>

                <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/uk/300968826/access-and-attention-why-serial-killers-like-lucy-letby-often-work-in-healthcare </p>

                <p>Yeah, they are really rare.  That's how come there needs to be a very very careful selection process trying to find them and trying to encourage them to apply and trying to throw out the applications from everybody else to expedite them into position quickly quickly.  Think of the red carpets that were rolled out for Dr Leeks (and others like them).  They didn't get to be appointed into their positions in spite of or despite their proclivities.  Did they?  Rather, they were hired *precisely because of* their willingness to do what most others would not.</p>

                <p>Think of the extensive training programme that there is to try and breed psychopathy.  To normalise it.  To encourage it.  To train it.  To select for it.  </p>

                <p>People are told 'it's soooooo competitive -- if you won't get in there and do anything anything anything we say then there are hundreds if not thousands behind you who will all willingly do it'.  At least, that's their defence, if they are held to account for their crimes.  'Just following orders'.  Etc.</p>

                <p>I mean, think of everything that goes into preventing and prohibiting medicine and so on from developing, in NZ.  All of the corruption that goes into throwing away applications from people who would speak out about crimes and atrocities so as to favor the people who would commit them.  </p>

                <p>I suppose that part of it is that if you are committing atrocites and so on, then you probably aren't likely to be complaining about the things that various other people are up to.  You maybe don't even complain about  not being paid.  I don't know if the pedophile teacher assistants (replacing teachers) are complaining about them not being paid.  Not complaining about not having qualifications etc.  They are probably quite good at sucking up.  Being quiet about the various crimes of their 'superiors' or whatever.</p>

                <p>NZ does everything it can to attract people like this from all over the world -- doesn't it?  Kim.com marketing that nobody will be extradited to stand trial (not even to the US).  Nobody will be prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus -- and (more importantly) nobody ever was.  Even when it was in the crimes act and we had about the highest rate of abortion nobody was ever prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus.  The laws are not upheld in NZ.  The government won't prosecute.  But even if they did the judges will not uphold the law.  So, it's quite the destination location for all the offenders of the world.  Who are allowed to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for visa re re re re re re re processing precisely because they are known offenders.  Correct?</p>

                <p>Wow.  Why don't we just write the entire population up as offenders.  Keep false records about them.  Being born in NZ is akin to being a criminal by birth, isn't it?  Original sin.  Something like that.  No people in NZ.  Are there?  What people do you see?  Not behaviorally modern, or something.  Wasn't that it?  NOt even trying to be fair at all.  Can't even process applications...  Won't do it.  Nobody home.</p>
