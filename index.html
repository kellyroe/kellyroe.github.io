                                <p>'Dr' Ashley Bloomfield is 'Dr' in virtue of graduating from MBChB (Medicine).  The Univerities of New Zealand are giving the bulk of the training places to 18 and 19 year olds (they maintain they have the discretion to choose to do this and the Courts have upheld their freedom to do anything include disccriminate against applicants on basis of race or income or post-code or secondary school or disability).  Ashley Bloomfield did not apply to study for PhD.  He does not have PhD.  I don't think he tutored or did laboratory demonstrations.  I don't think he wrote research publications.  I don't think he did any teaching or any research.  I'm not entirely sure how he went from MBChB to a 1 or 2 year Masters Degree (or how many months of enrolment they recorded his research project as having taken) but he went from there to Wellington and worked his way up the Government as a civil servant.  
                                </p> 

                                <p>AUT is apparently wanting to fire people on staff because it says they aren't teaching or researching enough.  The problem isnt' that they aren't teching or researching enough to be made Professor...  They aren't teaching or researching enough to be employees of the University, at all.  Meanwhile, Ashley gets made Professor for all the teaching and research work that he does not do.  On the basis of no teaching experience and on teh basis of no publications, at all.</p> 

                                <p>Did they publically advertise the Professor position that they have given to him?  HOw many applications did they get for the position?  Was he really teh most qualfied applicant for that job?  Did they not receive a single application from anybody with a PhD?  Not a single application from anybody with publication?  Not a single application from anybody with any teaching experience?  Did they then re-advertise the job to make sure that international candidates knew we were looking for a Univesrity of AUckland Professor?  In case other countries are still handing out PhDs when we don't seem to want to do that anymore because we dont' have any jobs for our graduates because all our jobs to to people who never graduated.  What f*cking nonsense.</p>

                                <p>The High Court Judges have declared that there is nothing to stop the Universities of NZ from enrolling whoever they want for whatever arbitrary reasons they want.  That includes them throwing away applicaitons on the grounds that the applicant is a race they don't like or whatever.  Including if the applicant is the victim of abuse in state care and they think the applicant would make a better victim than a perpetrator).  And with that knowledge we are supposed to believe that Otago has become the most desirable location in the whole world for people to go to to get the cheapest Medical Education in the English Speaking World so they have more money left over to donate to the University in the hope of buying good-will or something, one can only suppose.  New Zealand of course the best place to do experimentation on infants since we recently just changed the laws so that nobody will be profescuted for wrongful death or murder involving anything to do with a foetus.  Also, nobody was ever prosecuted before.  So it doesn't actually matter what any of the laws are.</p>

                                <p>I used to think that I would donate my inheritance to a University.  To provide a scholarship to a future student.  But there aren't any universities, by the seems of it.  The scholarship money doesn't get to the kids, it gets stolen or taken by teh administration and mis-spent.  The University throws away applications on arbitrary grounds.  Refuses to supply applicatons so that certain people are the only game in town.  We didn't have anybody with a PhD or any teaching experience to make Professor.  How many applicants were there for the Professorship recently given to Ashley?  The lengths they have to go to in order to try and make it look like he's the only f*cking game in town.</p>

                                <p>Of course it's a joke.  The Universities don't want me donating anything at all to them.  They decided that they would just take everything from me until I wouldn't have anything left to them to take.  They would just take all my research work and give me no credit whatsoever at all. It was somehow going to be more lucrative for them to refuse to allow me to apply for scholarshihps, even (well, they could just take the scholarships for themselves that I applied for or to), they would take my research proposals and, well, may as well just swap out my name for theirs and take all of the money for that for them too.  Hey, I know, let's get her slaving for the courts, then.  SHe can be instructed to file and refile and refile and refile and refile so the Judges can assert and reassert and reassert the Unviersities power to do anything anything anything they like with complete and utter imunity.  They dont' have to follow the Eudcation and Training Act.  They don't have to follow the Bill of Rights.  They can just exterminate people all voluntary-like.  Round them up for their shots (vaccine or euthanasia it's all the same).  No people.  I can't see any people.  Can you?  They can't publically advertise training or employment.  They can't assess people on the basis of the merits with respect to the things they are supposed to be selecting for (with respect to their published selection criterion).  How is NOT HAVING A PHD PART OF THE SELECTION CRITERION FOR PROFESSOR?  What a f*cking farce.</p>
