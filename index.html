 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container"> 

                        <p>Labor won't raise the retirement age.  Course not.  They will record that a 90 year old +++ Justice Toogood is the only Judge on Payroll.  Nobody else  need apply.  In fact, he will probably do it as an upaid volunteer at some point.  Wont' need to pay anybody at all.  Of course that's probably what is happening now.  Then the interns who write his judgments for him can pay the university and pay the university and pay the university and pay the university for more and more internships.  If they are real lucky they'll get sent to Russel McVeigh who likely sets them up well on what to expect interning for one of the Judges of the Supreme or High Court.  I'm sure.  I'm sure that is the basic ideology.  </p> 

                        <p>Justice Toogood doesn't see anything wrong with the University of Canterbury getting more and more and more money for having Mason Pendrous enrolled and for keeping him in Universiety Accommodation.  But he's been dead for over a month.  Just think how much money the hospitals get for having various people recorded as taking up a bed..  When they are literally dead.  I'm sure.  All the operations and so on they record as giving them.  All the money they get from the government and ACC and insurance companies.  More and more and more money.  Don't let the fact that the hostage is dead preclude you from getting more and more and more money for having the hostage reported as being in your 'care' fine government institution of NZ.  Justice Toogood (pulled out of his retirement for the occassion) doesn't see anything wrong.  Of course they wouldn't pay him (or pretend that they pay him) otherwise, I'm sure.</p>

                        <p>Do you think that Harvard would have acknowledged Jacinda as the democratically elected leader of the country of NZ if she hadn't have agreed to read the teleprompt to the medical graduates of Harvard telling them that nobody would be prosectued for wrongful death of a foetus (aka abortion) in NZ.  Destination NZ, everybody!  For all your knock-out baby studies.  People don't actually want to breed blonde-haried blue-eyed barbie dolls, necessarily.  Angleman syndrome is quite popular.  Delicate features and no ability to testify before the judge.  We can all agree on that.  </p>

                        <p>NZ is not even pretending to have a judiciary.  The social security appeals authority is refusing to rule on the ministry of social developments' decision that 'there is no essential need for justice in nz'.  The Ministry of Social Development has decided that that is the case.  They spend tens of thousands of dollars on lawyers to tell the judge that there is no essential need for justice for the people of NZ and the social security appeals authority refuses to deliver judgment to say otherwise.  Just refuses.  'Justice delayed is justice denied'.  There is no judiciary in NZ.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  I guess because they wouldnd't enrol people in law school, wouldn't tech them the lawas as wrote, wouldn't uphold them.  Won't graduate people who can read plain English.  Not even trying to uphold the laws as wrote.  There's actually nothing here.  Australasia still functions only as a slave prison detention camp.  The only leaders overseas will acknowledge for these countries read the teleprompts declaring it to be so.  There' snothing here.</p>

                            <p>
                            Who has applied to study a 120 point 1 EFT research masters qualification and had that signed off as completed within 34 weeks of enrolment?  Anybody?  Can you name me one person? 
                            </p>

                            <p>If you think that has happened, check your transcript.  Don't forget to check what the online version has to say now, as well.  The one they will say is the correct one when a prospective employer makes an inquiry.  Does it match the paper one that you have?  I guess if you complain about their 'software update' they throw you in prison for altering your enrolment records.  Is that the idea?  You should never never never stop paying for their crimes.  THey can't even keep accurate enrolment records.  Nobody home.   Nothing there.</p>

                            <p>
                            Who has applied to study a 360 point 3 EFT doctoral qualification and had that signed off as completed within 3 academic years of enrolment?  Anybody?  Can you name me one person?  Check your transcripts.
                            </p>

                            <p>Can you name for me a single person who has had their graduate level research *sent out for external examination by the University* in time for the externals to *possibly* sign off on completion of the qualifiation within the enrolment period?  I mean to say, if it takes 3 months to externally examine a 1 year research project with a 34 week enrolment period then the thesis will need to go out to externals at around the 22 week mark.  Can you name for me a single research student who has had their research sent out for external examination no later than the 22 week mark?  A single student?</p>

                            <p>What University?</p>

                            <p>The problem is not that there are certain topics that are off-limits.  The problem is that all topics are off-limits.  No research will be acknowledged as having been done.  The University gets more and more and more and more money from the government for keeping the hostages re re re re re re enrolled while the people on payroll do everything they can to prevent and prohibit the production of high quality timely research.  It is not possible.  They are not on payroll to do research.  They are on payroll to bully their studnets into being re re re re re re re enrolled for more and more and more money for the University.  The VC wants a payrise.  Therefore they must double and triple bill student enrolments for more and more and more money for the University.  The same brains behind Canterbury District Health Board refusing to even try and operate within the Government Approved Budget (their intentionally trying to blow the budget for special handouts every f*cking year) is now inspiring the University of Otago to similarly cook their books.  Claim to be too poor to pay the workers etc etc for increasing payroll for the VC etc.  What research output?  Take a look at the research output of the people on payroll to do research.  Do they do 5,000 words of research per year?  Less?  What University?   </p>

                            <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/490714/victoria-university-lack-of-government-funding-blamed-for-proposed-job-cuts The Vice Chancellor has exercised pay restraint for themselves, then?  Or has the Vice Chancellor made it clear that he's taking from the University absolutely everything he can get?  Take everything you can for as long as you can simply because you can.  How much money do the VC's of NZ Universities take for themselves each and every year?  To employ researchers without research output to refuse to send students research out for external examination.  Not even pretending to base the outcome of examination on the reports of external examiners.  What Universities?  There's nothing there.  Prison.  Detention.  Slave camps.  Nasty nasty business.  Not actually any kind of business at all.  F*cking psychopaths. </p>

                            <p>The 'word salad' is really getting underway, now.  Advertising for people to be paid as cleaners to assist with surgeries.  That is a step ahead for NZ, right?  To have people paid as cleaners assisting with surgeries.  What we usually do is have building apprentices assisting with surgeries.  That's how we decide who to scrub in -- right?  We only let the studnets who aren't on the roll attend cadavar dissection laboratory.  The ones without identification cards, without student identification numbers.  We have the surgeries attended  by people who aren't on payroll (not even as cleaners) usually.  People who pay and pay and pay and pay the University because the VC needs a payrise.  They need to restructure the University so that people can re re re re re apply for their old job for less pay.  Because otherwise the VC wouldn't feel like he was winning at life.  Cry cry cry cry cry about how the government underpays the University while the VC takes at least half a million out for themself each and every year...  Re re re re re enrolling studnets for double and triple billing for the University.  F*cking psychopaths.  There's nothign of any value there.  What value?  What values?  F*cking slavers.</p>

                            <p>Something about refugees of Australian Prison Camps outputting more research via mobile phone than those on payroll to to research at Otago.  Something about the literary output of the psychiatric facility being higher than those on payroll to research at Otago (e.g., Janet Frame).  Quickly quickly quickly fire the only person from Canterbury who had a research output (go after the one with the research output - a play).  What research? What Universities?  There's nothing there... </p>

                            <p>What doctors, lawyers, engineers?  What electricians?  What nurses?  What health system?  What judiciary?  There isn't anything there.  They can't  / won't even follow proper process on appointment of Judges.  They can't / won't follow any of the Statutory Laws.  How can anybody function as a Lawyer in NZ when the Judges aren't willing and or able to uphold the laws as written?  There really isn't anything here.  Prison.  Slave.  Detention.  Death camps.  Nasty bruitish and short.  No such thing as 'helping' professions.  Why would anybody listen to how NZ supposed authorities think that kiwis should be kept matters?  Highest rates of abuse in state care.  Abuse in state care.  Abuse in state care.  That's what 'care' means in word-salad land.  If John key strings you up with your feet tied so you can't run away from him (knowing you would run away without your feet tied) and he flips you over on your back..  NOt because he's qualified, but because the only experts he would acnowledge told him that that's what consent looks like...  What hope could there  be for something like a Starship Childrens Hospital?  Ffs.  Quickly quicklky quickly hand all the children over to custody of 'medical surgeons' registered to do that only because they pay and pay and pay and pay the Judiciary.  Don't they.  Not even trying to be fair.  What humanity?  What people do you see?</p>

                            <p>GYMS / STUDIOS / BOXES / EXERCISE PLACES</p>

                            <p>I've started looking into doing something a bit different from Les Mills.  Some of the individual instructors are great.  By that I mean to say they are able to be responsive to what is actually going on in the class rather than them focusing on aspects of the choreography.</p>

                            <p>Why do I say that?  Because the same major thinker or whatever behind it clearly hasn't changed much over the last couple decades, or similar, so they are stuck in the same programmming inbalances.  Everybody thinks that they have a blanced programme.  Or that they have the right focus for fixing up the majority of inbalances that people present with.  But that becomes visibly or obviously less true over time as the programme is actually effective.  So aspects of the present programming become, then, the next lot of weaknesses or deficiencies to be remedied.</p>

                            <p>For example, the Les Mills Core classes (and various other varients on the core conditioning theme where an aspect of that is present in most other classes) involves working abduction more than adduction.  All the choreography cues that tell the instructors to insist on hip width else wider stance for everything.  From squats to lying flat to..  Everything.  All the coreography around putting a band around the legs to make more work for the external rotators and abductors.  Comparable time or work isn't devoted to adduction.  It is a gap in their programming that is fairly persistent across or over different classes and it's the same imbalance that is in every new iteration of programming, too.  The people with the power to sign off on the choreography or whatever seem to be either blind to it as something they need to focus on or think about or else the individual instructors rise to the occasion inasmuch as they can within the basic scripting of choreography.</p>

                            <p>It starts with de-emphasising or ALLOWING individuals to do variants that are better for them.  It simply starts with them refraining from correcting something.  I'm not saying they should tell everyone to do the opposite of what the choreography is saying...  But it is up to them what they emphasise...</p>

                            <p>For example, you can say 'stand with your feet hip width apart' and if someone stands with their big toe and heel together (wanting to focus on adduction for their own reasons) simply move on.  You don't have to stop and stare at the person who is standing differently until they comply or leave.  You can just move on...  This matters more with postures where many people obviously wince or cringe when they are doing their best to follow instructions.  Or when the instructors say that they are feeling sooooo good doing cobra (the way that they are doing it) really dumping down through the lower lumbar spine without the lower abdominals engaged much at all.  You can do that when you are younger, I suppose, but the grinding away on the spinal segments will eventually...  What is the aim of the exercise classes?  Maybe they could pair up with a cleaner to do spinal surgeries??  Sigh.  I'm not sure what intent goes on, sometimes...  If it is intentional or ignorance or...  I don't know.   </p>

                            <p>That is what can be nice about the filmed classes.  When you have the freedom to follow along as best you can without being encouraged or required to over-extend.</p>

                            <p>Anyway...  I don't know.  I thought maybe I would try some different things.  So I did some water based stuff for a while.  Some pilates stuff...  Then I thought I'd try yoga.</p>

                            <p>So I did some hot yoga.  The problem is that it is too hot to expend energy or effort or do any work.  Passive cellular adaptations come from just being in the water.  It doesn't have to feel like work or like energy is being expended for genuine adaptations.  I do understand that.  But I want a more active form of exercise.  I like to feel some endorphins from exertion.  I enjoy that.  I want that to be a good part of what I'm doing.  I don't know.  ANyway..  Try some hot yoga.</p>

                            <p>It was 22 and 2.  Choreography.  Part of the script is something about 'back back back more back reach back back back so it hurts back'.  That is the script.  I would imagine or suppose that the reason why that is there is...  Um..  It is not supposed to hurt -- right?  That is supposed to  be where people do a little mental check to see whether they are doing it properly (where properly means it doesn't hurt)  -- right?  Anyway...  I guess it is ambiguous in the choreography as wrote.  You see different teachers put perhaps slightly different emphasis..  How strongly they are encouraging the 'back back back more back' in a class where people visibly wince and back off, then, when you say about the hurts part.  I mean to say...  The programme doesn't need to be abusive...  Interpretation..  Find the instructor you gel with or something.  I don't know...</p>

                            <p>You have to be a bit careful with yoga, I want to say.  But then you had to be careful with Les Mills too.  People encouraging you to hurt yourself.</p>

                            <p>Anyway...  I don't think anybody from the hot yoga was trying to see me injured...  But I will admit that I did a double take on the choreographed speaking that every instructor was supposed to say instructing people to reach back until it hurts.  Especially since it isn't clear to me that reaching back is something that is done, at all.  Rather than reaching UP.</p>

                            <p>Anyway...  Now I'm trying a different style...  This is an individual thing, but I didn't like how much I sweated in the HOt Yoga.  LIkely it was just a bit much after learning actually to like the smell of fresh chlorine and cool water from the pool...  It just felt icky and everything smelt awful...  No offense.  But yeah...  It was hard to properly clean my mat and get it dry between classes. . Yeah...</p>

                            <p>So, trying a different style.  Sure.  They wanted us to sign waivers before class that if we get injured it is on us.  Okay, that's fine.  Maybe they need the instructors to sign a similar waiver, then, so that they are less directive with their instruction.  I mean to say, I don't know why the instructors would think that they know better than me what is and is not likely to see or get me injured.  Particularly so when it is the first time they have ever met me and they don't know about my background (I might be considerably more qualified than they).  They have no idea -- but they see fit to be fairly directive in their instruction.</p>

                            <p>One of the instructors actually said to me that I might like to join the class next door if I wasn't going to be doing down dog with the rest of the class (if I was going to do childs pose instead).  I mean...  What is the difference between down dog and childs pose?  The hands and arms are in similar position in relation to the torso.  The scapula position is the same or similar.  The thoracic girdle.  You can work all of that much the same with perhaps less load (so it's a bit easier to work those aspects) from childs pose.  The hip position is different and the knee position is different.  And the ankle position is differnt.  But if you are having a hard enough time doing part of it properly then wouldn't you be less likely to injure yourself doing an easier version or variant? </p>

                            <p>I guess the issue is that other people in the class might see me and go 'yeah, actually, I think I'll do that, too' which is a threat to some instructors authority.  Or something.  I think it is more about that.  Anway..  Try and avoid the aspects that don't seem to be helpful, I suppose...</p>

                            <p>The thing is that..  Take certain things from gymnastics.  Unassistted handstands.  L sits.  Handstand to L sit.  L sit to handstand.  WOuldn't it  be great to have the strength in the torso and arms and legs to be able to handle your body weight like that?  That would be cool,  hey.</p>

                            <p>So how do you get from starting point of where you are to end point?  The end point being the Asanas from Ashtanga Yoga.  How?  One thing you could do is stare at the positions in the chart and try and superficially get your body into that shape.  Simply...  With the standing postures..  Imagine that instead of the person being drawn onto the wall in the wall poster..  Imagine flipping the wall poster down so that it's on the floor.  Now get a cleaner to give you an injection of muscle relaxant so the administrator can move your limbs into the right position creating all the proper angles.  You will find that your limbs can be moved into most of the positions...  Even to positions of dislocation.  Any of the twists.  Get your leg up behind your head.  ANybody can move another persons body into all kinds of positions like that if they are kept in a medially induced relatation..  Not dead.  Rigor Mortis.  You go rigid on death.  That's how you tell they are dead.  The muscles can't relax when you are dead.  Takes ATP to release them...  </p>

                            <p>So...  Now we should understand that corpse pose is not a resting posture.</p>

                            <p>How could it possibly be easier to 'relax into' corpse pose for 10 minutes than for 2 minutes? (You can rest when you are dead they say.  Hahaha they will not find you resting when you are dead.  Who will consent to lie broken a distorion of a human everything involuntarily wrenched out of alighment)?  Most people cannot lie flat, at all.  They aren't strong enough to pull the spine into proper alignment.  Medical science denies the aspiration is worth anything.  Accept your inevitable defeat, they reckon.  Put both your hands under your lumbar region and be sure that your spine is held by you out of alignment into what we have defined is 'normal' position.  Woudl you like back surgery now or tomorow or next decade?  </p>

                            <p>The medial anatomy people are wrong to hang skeletons up with s bends in their spine.  Those are the shapes of the broken spines they aspire to create more and more and more and more of.  The very act of hanging a skeleton up for display is grotesque.  Their bones will only get to rest over various people's dead body.  They dont' teach anatomy for the purposes of helping people at all. They don't even take the time to teach about proper alignment.  More and more and more and more money for them the worse and worse and worse they can make everything eto be.</p>

                            <p>And the point of the Asanas is not to relax into them.  It is to have enough strength in the muscles...</p>

                            <p>cat - cow (t spine flexion and extension around a properly set core) is an easier variant than cobra - down dog.  cat can become plank before cobra as strength developed in the arms and core so that you aren't over-extending yourself.  If you over-extend yourself then what happens is the bigger muscles take over the gross body positiioning and the smaller musclees holding your spinal segments into positions that don't impinge upon the spinal column etc) simply relax.  They can't grip.  They can't do anything...</p>

                            <p>It took me, like 1 year of flailing about in Les Mills core classes to be able to feel any work at all in my abs.  Because they were asking me to do so much such that it was impossible for the smaller muscles to do anything at all.  And if you can't activate them -- you can't strengthen them.  You have to do whatever it is that you have to do in order to get the correct muscles to actually work and actually start to do something.  Then, once you can have them activated,  you can work to strengthen them.  When the smaller muscles stop working -- there isn't any point your persisting with the exercise.  Persisting would only be training the wrong thing.  Your major muscles to take over.  So...  If you can get better core activation in childs pose than in down dog then do that then.</p>

                            <p>What is the point again?  To get from where you are to the end goal.  And you will never get there if you don't have the idea of progressions.  Smaller manageable tasks...</p>

                            <p>I don't know.  They do give us this little piece of paper where we are supposed to be able to say 'adjustment please' or 'no adjustment'.  They say they recommend you get adjustment the first few classes, anyway..  But I'd rather not ask or even allow them to make adjustments to me until they have taken time to observe what is going on for me and what it is that i'm trying to do.  Don't get me wrong:  5 independent people have pointed out to me (across 3 different places) that my hips are not level when they are supposed to be.  I did not know that.  And I'm trying to make them level as best I can and they are pointing out that they still are not level.  So that is GREAT.  If I put my arms on my hips or fold my arms behind my back I can feel for myself that what htey are saying is true.  One of them even was able to pull me into the right position when I kept activation -- so I was actually able to feel the end posture and feel for myself that it was correct.  Momentarily.  But I'm not strong enough in my stabilisers to be able to get there or hold it with integrity yet...</p>

                            <p>ANyway..  I don't know...  I'm not sure what I should have said to her in hindsight...  I don't know...  I guess they are wanting people to join a different class that they have where people have more individual programmes.  It might have been a primer for that.  That there is only so much you can do in a group class kind of a thing...</p>

                            <p>I don't know.  I guess it feels like some of the instructors think of what they are doing as a kind of group choreography where the aim is for the class to feel like they are part of something where they take pleasure or pride or whatever in mastering the choreography.  So they are all moving together in some sense.  So if you can't do that then you need to go away and do something else.  So, you can't be the guy in the wheelchair at glee club.  Because the dance choreography says that at this point we all raise our right foot and we step our right foot over here...</p>

                            <p>It is because they are intentionally fixing things in malaligned positions.  MEdical science aspires to fix people's spines rigidly into s bend shapes.  They get out their hammers and get building apprentices to hand them the nails.  THey aspire to fix things into positions most likely to create further problems down the track.  More and more and more money for them.  It's soooooo competitive.  Why would dthey help you?  Doesn't really make any sense, hey.</p>
