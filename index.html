 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->

                                <p>Alright, so here's the story.  I am waiting on two things: </p> 

                                <p>(1)  The Australian National University.  They are locating my student records and saying something about why I left the ANU without recieving credit for a PhD.  They say they will get back to me around July 15, 2022.
                                </p>  

                                <p>(2)  The social security tribunal of New Zealand.  The New Zealand government chooses to keep me on less than minimum wage.  I am not shoulder-tapped for work (as is customary), and my applications for work are not progressed (postitions will remain unfilled and re-advertised), my applications, progressions, completions from NZ universities are not progressed, either.  The courts also aren't progressing my filings.  The supreme court has ruled that I am required to pay them more than $20,000 in 'security for costs' to have cases heard on appeal after justice was denied to me in the high court proceedings. 
                                </p>

                                <p>I am aware that they think they can get free labor / free 'work' out of the things that I post to the internet so that stops. I'll try and time-stamp daily in case it helps establish time of death, if it comes to that.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Monday 6 June 4:32pm
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                Tuesday 7 June 12:20pm
                                </p>

                            <p>
                            The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications.  They define a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a> 
                            </p>

                            <p>Here is how much the Inland Revenue says I owe the New Zealand Government for all of the Tertiary Education the New Zealand Government has provided to me: <a href= "judicial-review/ird-loan.pdf"target="_self"> $104,663.68 </a>  They do not provide a break-down of what courses they recorded me as having been enrolled in.  The qualifications that I have recieved are only BA(Hons) and MA.  They refused to progress a 120 point MPhil with 05-03-2018 start date.  They enrolled me in other programmes totalling more than 120 points (invoicing more than 120 points) and then recorded that I failed.  The judge did not see any problem, in the High Court Proceeding.
                            </p>

                           <p>Australasian Universities believe they are entitled to simply refuse to process or progress students work, however.  Take it to court, they say.  Now the courts are refusing to progress filings.   
                            </p>

                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  They aren't progressing the filings. 
                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  
                                </p> 

                            <p>
                            It seems to me that the Australian Constition explicitly states that New Zealand is regarded, by them, to be a State of the Federation of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  Australia refuses to honor it's own Constitution.  New Zealand seems to function as a detention camp of Australia only. 
                            </p>

                            <p>Here are  <a href="judicial-review/sup-court-waikato.pdf" target="_self"> My Filings </a>to the Supreme Court regarding the University of Waikato    
                            </p>

                            <p>The Social Security Appeal Authority  <a href="judicial-review/ssaa.pdf" target="_self"> Intention to schedule a phone call sometime after July 4. </a></p>
