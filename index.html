                            <p>In Roe v University of Waikato, Justice Toogood (who isn't supposed to be Judge at all since he's past the age of retirement) found that he could not see any problem with the University of Waikato recording that Ms Roe was enrolled in a programme of study that she had never applied to be enrolled in.  Ms Roe did not apply to be enrolled in an MPhil qualification in 2019.  And yet her IRD student loan says that she owes money for the 'University' having recorded her as being enrolled in that qualification.  Where is her application form to enrol in an MPhil programme of study for 2019?  She applied to be enrolled in a 120 point 1 EFT 34 week (including the external examination period) MPhil in 2018 and supplied them with a thesis in September of 2018.  They delayed getting the thesis out to externals (they refused).  Ms Roe got them another thesis in October of 2018.  They sent it out for external examination for the wrong qualification.  PhD rather than MPhil.  The externals required substantive changes -- but kept the thesis.  The Calendar Regulations say that when substantive changes are required but the thesis it not returned to the candidate then the changes are to be completed within 10 weeks.  Ms Roe made the changes within 10 weeks and they refused to get the thesis out to externals.  Refused to get the January 2019 thesis out to externals.  Refused to get the February 2019 thesis out to externals.  Recorded that she was re-enrolled (pay us more fees) in 2019 when she never applied to be enrolled in 2019.  She'd written them a 120 point 1 EFT 34 week thesis already.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                             https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/in-depth/491859/cash-strapped-waikato-university-has-paid-former-cabinet-minister-steven-joyce-nearly-1-million</p>

                             <p>And how much has Quigley taken for himself over how many years of mis-management?  Clearly we needed to get someone in from overseas to destroy the University.  How about Kay Weaver?  How  much did she take in her capacity as head of the school of graduate research while refusing to get theses out for external examination and refusing to allow external examiners to sign off on completion of research degree?  How much money did she take to refuse to allow the University to have research output? </p>

                             <p>The Scholarships money isn't going to the graduate research students either.  They are not providing lists of named recipients for Masters Scholarships that were supposed to be awarded on the basis of academic merit.  I think it highly likely that the money is not going to the research students at all.  Are we more corrupt than Fiji?  Yes.  Seems to.  They paid their women's rubgy players, it seems.  Finally.  After being publically shamed about it on social media.  I would have thought Waikato University wouldn't have wanted to pay tens of thousands of dollars to external counsel to have them defend their right to record student enrolment in qualifications the student never applied to.  But they don't seem to have the most basic of self-preservation instict, at all.  They won't enrol people in the programmes they apply to.  They enrol them in programmes they never applied to.  F*cking corruption.  </p>

                             <p>I'm sure the students Auckland refused to graduate from Medicine are just thrilled to learn what GP they are supposed to be pimped out to.  Who is required to be their baby's daddy.  All the GPs past the age of retirement.  THey aren't going to voluntariliy walk away from their pay cheques.  Justice Toogood refuses to give up having his day in court.  Where are there students they graduated?  What education and training system?  Psychopaths.  They will not train the next generation.  They will not get out.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>
