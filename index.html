                            <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/science/300959963/stronger-than-tnt-the-vials-of-acid-that-saw-a-bomb-squad-called-to-a-university  Probably what you would do is go in at night.  During the down-time.  When you don't need to evacuate much in the way of anybody at all and when you can most safely detonate explosives in the domain.  In the stealth of night.  When nobody is anywhere near close to the situation.  But that way you don't get to see the..  Uh..  Hundreds -- was it?  Hundreds of thousands -- was it?  All the students and staff.  The faculty.  The researchers.  All of the people based in Grafton Campus.  How many of them walked out the front door when it was evacuation time.  Uh..  What's that?  *NOBODY HOME*.  Nothing there.  Nothing to see -- at all.  What, then of all the student doctors and nurses and optometrists and..  Ahahahahhahahahahahahah they pay and they pay and they pay and they pay and they pay for visa *entry* to NZL.  And in NZL..  Uh..  Nothing to see.  Nobody home, at all...) </p>

                            <p>Oh my it's sooooo competitive!  It's sooooooo copmetitive that the only applicant to MPhil in Philosophy with the University of Waikato (the *ONLY APPLICANT* at the institution whose primary function (according to statutory law of NZ) is research.. It is *sooooo competitive* that the *only applicant*...  Cannot possibly have their application processed..  Cannot have adequate supervision...  Cannot have their work forwarded to externals..  It's sooooo competitive..  It's soooo competitive..  That the ONLY applicant..  It's sooooo competitive.  Now we understand the nature of the competition.  It's sooooo competitive to get into Medical School.  All the applications from domestic adults are thrown away and only teenagaers else international teenagers (non-domestic) will have more and more and more debt recorded against their name.  It's sooooo competitive.  It's soooooooo competitive..  There is no competition.  Because there actually is nothing there in fact.  What 'University'?  What 'health system'?  What 'judciary'?  The dumb and f*cking dumber show in fact.  *There's nothing there*.  It's soooo competitive!  Alllll of the mone for Kim Sterelny and various others over 65 years (after 45+ years of government payroll they never figured self-suficiency.  Even after all that could not even figure so much as a start-up to invest in.  Alll of the payroll for them, therefore.  They never made it to financial independence.  All of the governmetn salary they got for 45+ years and they were still too much of a f*cking fitness trap to get to financial independence.  Why, then, did the government choose to invest in them instead of the likes of me?  Go figure.  All heil the mighty and illustrious Dr Leeks!!  Sooooo motivational and inspirational!  The only game in town!  ALL Heil the current state (future prospects for) Meidcine and University and Government..  There's nothing to see!!! There's nothing nothing nothing, at all!!!</p>

                            <p>How much do they pay for a little brown baby?  A little Rubi Tui.  Don't worry, we impregnaged the mother when she was in a state care institution (psychiatric or hospital or prison or whatever) and we removed it under sedation without any kind of informed consent, as is our way.  Now, how much can the government get for it on the international market do you suppose?  Just tell the mother that it died.  Else arrange for the mother to die in state care.  Else blackbird the mother into believing that she's incompetent and so on and so forth.  She can't tell when it's cold or when conditions are inhumane.  It's clearly the most socially responsible thing to do.  Sell the baby to international investors.  It's all about the people the people the people.  Right?  And NZL trafficks in meat.  Of whatever variety.  Therei sno informed consent. What people?  Animals.  Not kept half as well as foreigners keep their pets in fact.  What people?  What people in NZL?  There's nobody home.  Nothing there in fact.  Don't take it personally.  The Australian Natioanl Univesrity can't  /   won't process applications to enrol.  Can't / won't get studnets work out for external examination.  There's nobody home.  Nothing there, in fact.</p>

                            <p>How many years of work did the ANU take from Dave Wall before he got to the point of being hospitalised?  And then what did you do to him?  Give him thamine before glucose and blame him for the fact that you didn't do the most basic of things that you were supposed to do regarding getting his work out for timely external examination.  F*cking psychopaths.  In fact.  F*cking psychotics.  Take Kim Sterelny and his wife to boot.  You can f*cking well have them.  The dumb and f*cking dumber show, I swear.  Make it to slavery?  Australia?  Make it out of the f*cking 'we are apes and our graduate studnets are evolved apes' to slavery?  Have we discovered or realised slavery yet?  F*cking psychotics.  There's nothing there, hey.  Can't even parse the constitution that they wrote.  Nobody home.  F*cking ratards.</p>

                            <p>Waiting for the social security appeals authority to overturn the ministry of social development's declaration that 'justice not essential need'.  It hasn't been overturned when the substantive hearing of the issue was more than 9 months ago.</p>

                            <p>This is so that cases can be heard on appeal.  The High Court Judges were (in 2 instances) re-appointed into position from retirement.  NZ has a compulsory age of retirement for Judges and the Judges are required to get out once they hit that age.  These 'Judges' were required to have gotten out.  They were not appointed  by proper process at all, because there is no proper process for re-appointing Judges past the age of their retirement.  Why am I having to explain this?  NZ is not even trying to be rule by law, at all.  What judiciary?</p>

                            <p>The 'Universities' of NZ are not properly processing applications to enrol, graduations etc.  They refuse to comply with the education and training act. They refuse to comply with Tertiary Edcuation Commission Guidelines.  Chris Whelan is paid upwards of several hundred thousands of dollars every year to take all the complaints that he receives every year and declare each and every one of them (since he was appointed to office in about 2014) to not be a complaint of serious wrongdoing, at all.  He refuses to follow the policy that the NZVCC wrote that it would follow when it receives complaints.  He refuses to get evidence to police.  He refuses to bring issues (or allow complainants to bring issues) before the NZVCC.  Not even trying to comply with the statutory laws or government policy documents of NZ.  Judges hauled out of retirement for the occassion cannot / will not see anything wrong.  There are none so blind as those who will not see.</p>

                            <p>The Supreme Court of NZ declares that it is not a matter of public interest that NZ Universities are not properly processing applications to enrol in MBChB (Medicine) or graduate research qualifictions.  That they are keeping false records about enrolments including sending false information to the Inland Revenue Department.  Saying studnets have been enrolled in programmes they never applied to.  Refusing to get work that has been submitted for external examination out for external examination.  What Universities?  What judiciary?  WHat health system?  They aren't processing applications for Medical School.  They aren't processing graduations.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  There's nothing there.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>Poor Dr Green.  Poor Dr Leeks.  It isn't like what they were doing was any different from what any other Medical Doctor was doing.  What they ARE doing.  All of the qualities that we value.  Expedited into position quickly quickly quickly by throwing everybody else's application away.  Professor Glue's Glue Factory is the only game in town.  Declaring (particularly young females) to be treatment resistent and feeding them horse tranquilier, ketamine, LSD...  As a first treatment last resort...  Auckland busying itself manufacturing ketamine and LSD...  Anything easy and cheap.  Anything...  Abusive.  Not keeping medical records of prescribed medications.  Drugging people in the 'hospitals' and likely the prisons etc as well.  Tool for gaslighting (it's not cold!  There must be something wrong with you!  It's all in your head!)  Bullying and abuse.  Only game in town.  Everybody else's application thrown away.  Better re re re re re apply for visas, all you foreigners, so that you can come to NZ and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the 'Universities' to do anything anything anything everything Professor Glue says (in return you can do a little anything anything to the victims, no doubt, I mean who would believe them anyway)?  Right?  What health system?  What University?  What Medical SChool?  What judiciary?  Not even trying to be rule by law.  Will not properly process applications to Medicine.  Throwing the theses away.  Throwing the theses away.  Will not acnkowledge research output.  Poor Dr Leeks.  Poor Dr Green.  Poor Professor Glue.  It isn't like what they are doing is any different or any worse to anything that anybody else on payroll is doing.  NZ refused to have or allow things to be any other way.  F*cking psychopaths.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>The Education and Training Act says that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are ELIGIBLE to be enrolled in the programme they have applied to.  The 'Universities' refuse to accept this and the courts refuse to uphold the laws.  They preferentially record that teenagers (under 20) have been enrolled in Tertiary Education (often levels of debt against their name) when it is in the law books that they are entitled to a free secondary education until they are 20.  The 'Universities' throw away applications from domestic adults.  They will not do it.  They will nto process the applications to enrol.  They also will not get studnets work to external examiners.  They refuse to allow qualification completions.  They will not do it.  They record re re re re re enrolment in qualifications when the requirements for them have been met by the studnet years ago.  Decades ago, in some instances.  THey are not even trying to be an education system, at all.  HOstages.  Slaves.  There's actually nothing there.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                            <p>Hey, I know..  Instead of processing my application to Medical School in accordance with the policy and procedure documents that there are (it takes enters the full time undergraduate GPA into the selection algorithm along with interview score and UMAT / UCAT score and it outputs the rank order score) they can give the places to the childeren of the administration who can explain to them that if they do anything anything their superiors say for x y z number of years then they themselves can get on to committing all the crimes and absues of Dr Green and Leeks and they can start up their very own Professional Glue Factory.  The spoils of war!   </p>

                            <p>And the government can just pay or pay off (or something) however many people to say 'sorry' in a too little too late  manner or way.  Mostly what it is about is ensuring that the structures and people expedited into position are in place to ensure that all of the everything we value continues on.  Poor Dr Leeks.  Poor Dr Green.  Poor Professor Glue.  Send Professor Glue overseas to conference..  See how much money he can raise for NZ in visa application fees after selling to foreigners this ideology of them coming to NZ and doing anything anything anyting tehy want with complete and utter impunity.</p>

                            <p>How much does it cost to dump your wife in Hillmorton, these days, and be made or declared bachelor, again?  Acknowledged by NZ in the international papers as being a consultant Orthopedic Surgeon?</p>

                            <p>This lady who was found to be killing babies in England.  She never would have been discovered for that if only she had have chosen to move to NZ.  Firstly, we don't keep records on such things.  Secondly, it isn't like her records would be any different from anybody else's on payroll.  Right?  </p>

                            <p>kim.com advertising or marketing to everyone in the world how they can move to NZ if they may be prosecuted for crimes overseas.  Move to NZ and never be extradited to stand trial overseas.  NZ is the prison camp detention camp of the world.  By design.  </p>

                            <p>That seems to be the ideology -- right?  The Australiain Constitution declares NZ to be the second named state of Australia (it was provided in the constitution regardless of whether NZ government consents or not).  The process for changing the constitution requires the people to be given voting papers.  They refuse to supply voting papers to people born in NZ.  Australia chooses to govern Australia like a prison detention camp.  Standford prison experiment come to life with being divise and appointing overlords to bully and abuse everybody else.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  No ideology of equality.  It's a hostile and competitive environment.  How is cooperation even possible at all?  What cooperation?  F*cking psychopaths.  Bullies.  ABusers.  Not even trying to be fair.  Not even trying to be rule by law.  What people?  WHat people do you see?</p>
