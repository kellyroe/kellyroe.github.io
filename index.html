                              <a href="./writing/ks.png">Here is an example of an email from Kim Sterelny (who will not write me a reference).</a> 

                              I collated the 'few small chunks' as he refers to them, here:
                              </p>

                                </p>

                                <p>You know the best part about Universities?  Seeing all the new books.  All the new Masters theses (50,000 words) and all the new Doctoral theses (up to 100,000 words).  The new book shelves.  Where they put the new books that the library has purchased or had submitted as completed theses. </p>

                                <p>I submitted 2 hard copies of a Master of Arts Thesis to the University of Waikato in 2005.  I had it hard bound.  That took a couple weeks.  Then I collected the hard bound books and walked them over to the Research School.  I said I wanted to submit the books and they gave me a form to fill out saying that it was my own work and I'd referenced things I used from other people.  And that was that.  2 copies were submitted.  One was supposed to be lodged in the library.  Is it still there?  I don't know.  The other one was supposed to be (by convention anyway) kept by the University Philosophy Programme.  They have a few research theses in the tea room.  They posted the department's copy to me.  Shipped it to me when I was in Australia.  I don't know why they didn't want to keep it in the Philosophy Programme tea room.  </p>

                                <p>It had typographical errors in it, apparently.  Which is embarrassing for the department.  That nobody from the department was able to help me iron out the typographical errors before submission.  That nobody would do that for me.  That was the level of help or assistance.  All the people on payroll to help with research output, apparently, and nobody to do so much as help iron out typographical errors.</p>

                                <p>But it's not supposed to be a nobel prize, let's face it.  You don't fail a studnet for a typographical error.  Do you?  Well..  You don't actually pass any of the studnets either.  Do you?</p>

                                <p>Nobody from the ANU had reports from external examiners.  Not so far as I could see.  Nick Southwood said that he was told by the University that the external examiners had accepted his thesis without requesting he make any changes to it at all!  How plausible is that?  They also didn't request an oral defence or examination?  How plausible is that?  I don't think they examined your thesis, Nick.  I see you found you way on payroll, after a head injury.  But they did not arrange for anybody to have their thesis externally examined.  Nobody had reports from external examiners.  Nobody had public oral defences.  I did not see anybody with a scheduled public oral defence at any time from any department during my time at the ANU.  What University?  </p>

                                <p>I don't understand how various others are claiming to have done enough for PhD.  Are claiming to have PhD's.  Do their transcripts actually say that they have PhD's conferred?  Did anybody graduate?  How come I've never seen pictures of anybody in their ANU gowns at graduation?  No certificates for their wall. Degree certificates.  I didn't see any graduations at the ANU..  Not for PhD students...  No graduations...  Huh.  How did people get visas etc to be employed by various Universities in England and the USA etc etc when they aren't functioning as Universities at all?</p>

                                <p>When does my work go out for external examination Kim?  When is the deadline I need to submit the hard copies, then?  I did that already...  Spent 2 years working on a 120 point Masters for Waikato...  They told me I needed to have it submitted by 27 November 2005.  Okay..  So I did that, then.  Not sure why the deadline was a year late...  But I'd never missed a deadline before.  So I guess I believed them when they told me 27 November 2005.  And as for you and the ANU..  You don't tell me anything at all.</p>

                                <p>Do you have to walk over to the clocktower and see if they are going to pay you every 2 weeks, Kim?  For all the teaching work that you do?  All the supervision?  Getting your studnets work out for external examination.  Yeah right.  Not writing any references.  Reattributing authorship to other people.  Right?  Taking the submissions to the journals and reattributing authorship to the people who only go to University to hang out with you and pretend to enjoy your company on camping trips.</p>

                                <p>What University?</p>

                                <p>Where is all the research output?  All the books that the people write.  It's such a great environment says Sterelny.  I guess that's why they pay him.  They pay him to cry cry cry about how f*cking hostile and psychopathic everybody is.  How everybody else was murdered off however long ago and he's the only game in town.  What University?  There's nothing there.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                                <p>Well, we know how it goes, right?  Waikato is hiring so they'll hire from Dunedin and the USA.  Rather than me.  The ranking, you see.  I'm from the Waikato so that means I'm the most garbage.  They'll hire people from everywhere else in the world, rather than hiring the likes of me.  And Auckland..  Will hire from the USA before they will hire from NZL.  If they have an entry level position they'll hire the USA wife of Brett Calcott -- before they'll hire Brett.  I guess it's 2 for the price of 1.  I suppose actually it's about having the Auckland studnets uploading their work to Turnitin so that Penn can take and take and take the Auckland student's work and have it processed and attributed to Penn's students and she can arrange to have the Auckland studnets bullied into handing over their work for low to no pay so that the people from Penn can graduate Penn and go into management jobs managing the Auckland slaves.  Is that the great cunning plan?  Clearly nobody from NZL could have worked that job.  Had to fill the position from overseas.  Of course.</p>

                                <p>Then the USA hire can write about Maaori and science and so on.  Because clearly nobody from NZL could ever write about that sensibly.  Most certainly not Tahua.  Who handed over work for how many years?  For how many years?  Before they tell him his thesis has been accepted by externals and they haven't requested so much as a typographical alteration!  Not so much as one more reference?  He didn't need to read just one more book?  His research wasn't outdated already and everybody had moved on without him?  He was allowed to limp over the finish line on the understanding that it was the end of his career certainly not the start of anything.  That's how Auckland treats their own.  Why?  So the various over 65's won't give up their payrolls.  Not a job for anybody else but over their dead bodies.  THey don't like to share.  There's nothing there. </p>

                                <p>There certainly isn't a health system, either.  3 Fellowships to Jacinda so that she can be the new wing-man for the new Epstein replacement, I suppose.  Urgency urgency it's an emergency how we can get the laws changed.  The government lobbyist highly esteemed anti-intellectual no intellectuals of NZL.  Selling out on payroll to help people figure out how to bundle the scholarship studnets onto their yachts for the summer do a little edu touruism raping and pillaging helping me helping me help myself to you surgeries and cervical exams etc etc on the way to their bolt holes where they can get busy breeding their knock-out babies in the name of the new governmetn institutiosn of NZL.  Sorry!  You lose!  Sorry!  haha!  There's nothing there.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                                <p>Apparently Ashley Bloomfield is Professor now.  Makes sense.  He never applied to do PhD.  Never did the work for one.  No research output.  Of course they'd hire him.  Thtey certainly would never dream of hiring anybody else.  What University?  There's nothing there.  Where are all the books?  Where is all the research output?  In spite of.  Despite.  Look at the garbage they fund.  The only game in town.  How many people can we torture today?  Keep badly?  Hepilng me helping me helping me help myself to you.  F*cking psychopaths.  Where's my Degree, hey?  F*cking psychopaths.  </p>
