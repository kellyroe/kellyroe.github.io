 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->

                            <article>

                            <p>How long are you supposed to work full time on a 120 point research project before it goes out for external examination?  How about a 360 point one?  For it to be sent out with instructions for external examiners to examine it with respect to acceptability for the programme the student applied to be working on, and the one they had been working on, I mean to say.  How many decades are you supposed to hand over research to NZ Universities so they can re-atribute authorship to someone else or give your research away or attempt to bury it if they do not like what you have to say? </p> 

                            <p>MA.  The University of Waikato kept me enrolled for 2 academic years and 1 summer school period.  It was a 120 point 1 year research qualification only.  </p>

                            <p>PhD.  The Australian National University had me as a summer scholar.  They accepted my work well enough for them to give me a Government Scholarship to do a PhD.  They never got my work out to externals so that it could be externally examined.     </p>

                            <p>MPhil.  I only enrolled in this because the University of Auckland said that completing it would be enough for them to consider an MBChB application from me and process it on the basis of it's academic merits.  They said I needed to complete a new qualification since my MA was completed more than 5 years ago and the ANU never got my research out for external examination and Auckland said they wouldn't acknowledge Australian Qualification anyway.  So I applied to enrol in a 120 point MPhil with the intention of completing the 120 point programme of study in 1 academic year on a full time basis.  Waikato refused to get the work out for external examination.  Instructing me to keep working in excess of requirements for the Degree.  Then they instructed external examiners to examine it for the wrong qualification (PhD rather than MPhil where a PhD is three years of study and about twice the length).  Then they re-enrolled me in the MPhil for more than 120 points -- even though I never applied to re-enrol in any programme of study.  Then they refused to get more work I had done out for externals.  Then, when the overseas external said he wanted an oral defence they recorded that they failed me for the qualification.
                            </p>

                            <p>So, I have more than 100,000 of student loan for qualifications that NZ Universities refuse to acknowledge.  NZ and Australian Universities won't get my research work out to be externally examined (for the qualification I was enrolled in).  Not because they think externals will fail me.  But because they think they will pass me.  But there cannot be a job for me, apparently.  There will be a job for me only over their dead bodies.  Because they are the  only game in town and it's soooooo competitive.  </p>

                            <p>Auckland University and Otago University are not properly processing applications to MBChB (Medicine).  They are throwing away applications when they think that the applications will appear favorable compared to other applicants.  They are throwing away applications before they go before the Medical Admissions COmmittee so that their preferred candidates (e.g., their dependents) can be the only game in town.  They are not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                            <p>NZ Universites are not functioning as Universities.  They have various people on payroll who do no research.  They refuse to allow their students to have their research go out to externals and refuse to credit them as having completed the Degrees.  That way they are forced to stay in NZ, I guess.  Can't apply for jobs.  Can't apply for research funding.  WOuld only have the applications thrown away, anyway.  Can't leave the country because they don't have any qualifications acknowledged.  MOre than 100,000 debt recorded against my name.  Full time GPA of 8.6.  But no job for me.  Only a job for me over their dead bodies, apparently.  Won't even re-train me then in Medicine.  Since apparently the problem is that we have more Philosophy Graduates than jobs.  Which is why we have to hire USA Graduates and Australian Graduates.  British Graduates.  Foreign Nationals.  So that NZers can be kept unemployed.  Preferntially hiring foreigners.  Even when teh NZers do have Degrees.  But they pretty much stopped graduating NZers.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>I guess a few do have jobs overseas.  NZ PhD grads, I mean.  Actually no.  I don't think that is true.  NZers who were acknowledged as having graduated from Australian Universities.  Did their work go out for external examination?  I don't actually think that it did.  I think they just choose to tell some people that they have done enough.  After they have  been tapped on the shoulder for a job offer.  Told to get their CV in as a mere formality.  So they can participate in the scummy scam of refusing to get their students work out for external examination.  Taking the work of some and reattributing authorship to others.  Giving the students work away.  Supressing that which they do not like.  Chocolate coating it and handing it to others.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  Apparently it's soooooo competitive.  But there is actually nothing there. </p>

                            <p>People don't enrol in Uni because they want to learn.  Ashley Bloomfield just got made Professor ffs.  He never worked on a PhD or an MD.  He doesn't have any research output.  Why doesn't he practice Medicine with his NZ Medical Degree? Oh.  THey won't register him so he actually see patients.  Shane Reti sees his patients for 1 or is it 3 weeks of every year only.  Not even trying to have a health system.  Justice Toogood doesn't see any probelm with NZ Universities recording enrolment in progarmmes of study (enrolment periods) that the studnet never applied to.  Well, then, sign them all up for their indefinate detention in public health.  They can be detained indefinately under the 'zero fees scheme' and their work can never be externally examined on it's academic merits at all.  There can be no reading list.  Just repeat back to Ashley what you read on the powerpoint presentation that he stole from someone else for you to memorise.  Not even trying to be fair.  What education and training system?  Reappointing judges out of retirement.  Refusing to appoint new judges.  Guess they don't have any law grards.  The Degrees are more than 5 years old so no longer acknowledged.  Except for Ashley and the like being re-deployed into positions they aren't even qualified for.  Telling the grads of Harvard to come eto NZ to do their knock out baby gene studies trying to breed a happy slave underclass.  Giving employment to foreigners so that they can keep NZers unemployed.  So they can give Ashley hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to do a job where he  makes decisions that are 'technically unlawful'.  Where the courts provide teeth that the government employees can do anything anything anything they like (even break the law) with the blessing of the legal system.  What judiciary?  What health system?  What education system?  Prison slave detention camp.  The only leaders for NZ that international community will acknoweldge are ones who apparently use their soverigny to choose to contribute towards NZ's being so.  Not because it is a penal colony of the Northern Hemisphere because it is under British Control.  But because the leaders voluntarily choose to soverignly rule it so.  Of course.  Sure.  No problems.  Don't see any problems.  No problems to see.  Supression and repression and no problems at all.  We don't know how lucky we are.</p>
