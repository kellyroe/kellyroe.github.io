            <p>Have I done enough for paid employment yet?  What do the external examiners have to say?  Oh, you haven't gotten around to sending my work out yet.  Yeah, right.  What education and training system?  They pay Sterelny (past the age of 65) to be sooooo hostile and soooo competitive.  Sooooo comeptitive to undermine it all.  There isn't anything there.  Why did they even pay him?  He didn't do any teaching at all.  It had one job to do in fact (it takes the thesis and it gets it out to external examiners).  I mean, it could help make the thesis better since it's being paid to supervise.  But the most f*cking minimal thing that it could possibly do is to take the work and get it to externals.  There isn't anything there.</p>

            <p>They won't process complaints of wrongdoing.  There isn't anything there.  What education and training system?  What health system?  Detention prison camps and f*cking slavers.  Stanford Prison Camp Experiment.  The social construction of the prevention and prohibition of social development.  There's nothing there.</p>

            <p>They tell me (employees paid to advise prospective medical students) that I have to complete a new qualification from a NZ University to be eligible for enrolment in MBChB.  </p>

            <p>They refuse to follow the laws.  The laws say that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible to be enrolled in qualifications they have applied to.</p>

            <p>The laws say that NZ citizens are entitled to a free secondary education until they turn 20.  So they enrol them in tertiary institutions and record levels of debt against their name from when they are...  AUT was saying they had a 14 year old finance studnet from Vietnam enrolled with their institution.  What education and training system?  There isn't anything there.</p>

            <p>They put the `students' to unpaid labor doing all of the work while they don't even pay them.  They record more and more and more debt against their  name only.  Forcing them to live in student slum accommodation or Professors houses.  The first year students output more research (each one of them individually) than people who are paid to be Professors.  They won't get their studnets work out for external examination.  They hand it over to Professors from the northern hemisphere to pass of as research outputs of their own or their own studnets.  THey don't have oral defences because of all these doctoral qualifications they handed out to people who didn't even do the research they attribute to them.  They can't even explain it.  You can tell in a conversation with them.  Which is why they won't discuss academics.  Party party party it's compulsory it's important for your education to go away on camping trips!  What education and training system.  There isn't anything there.</p>

            <p>Prison detention camps.  Have I done enough for paid employment yet?</p>

            <p>The Office of the Ombudsman and the Privacy Commission are supposed to be NGO's.  THey are supposed to employ the most qualified person for the postion.  They advertise positions of all levels from most senior to most junior.  From permanent positions (where people can actually plan for a future) and it's only temporary positions for 3 or 2 or only 1 year.  I'm not qualified enough for any of that to even be offered an interview.  Yeah, right.</p>

            <p>There is nothing there.  Prison death camps.  CHristopher Whelan has not processed a single complaint of wrongdoing against the `universities' of NZ since he was appointed into his position of office in 2014.  We are supposed to believe that nobody is willing or able to process a complaint of wrongdoing so that they need to pay him quarter of a million dollars per  year.  Nobody else could possibly work that job.  It's too f*cking hard for  them to say `supply me with the evidence of wrongdoing so I can forward it to the police.  It is then up to that whether and when the government prosecutes the wrongdoing within the education and training system.</p>

            <p>They are keeping hostages.  Detention camps.  Prison camps.  A PhD is supposed to take 3-4 years only with 2 years minimum and up to 1 year of external examination.  THey won't get the work out to externals.  They won't do it.  There is not an education and training system there.  So, then, who do they payroll?  People who had their own theses go out for external examination?  They had publically scheduled oral defences?  When?  How come I have NEVER SEEN A SINGLE ONE.  All the seminars and talks that I've been to over however many years and I HAVE  NEVER SEEN A SINGLE PUBLICALLY SCHEDULED ORAL DEFENCE OF A DOCTORAL CANDIDATE.  There arent any doctors.  It is where the `best and the brightest' go off to die.  There is f*cking nothing there.</p>
