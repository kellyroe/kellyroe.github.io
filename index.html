                            <article>

                                <p>This website documents how Australasia does not have an Education and Training System.  Rather, they keep a series or system of detention or prison or slave camps up and down the land.  It is sooooo competitive that some people are paid by the government to hold hostages or to keep slaves while other people are to be kept detained indefinately with no credit for the work they have done while their work is not sent out to external examiners else it is sent out for examination for the wrong degree.  Apparently I need to wait for the older generation to die  before there will be a job for me.  Once they have received all the research and teaching money they believe they are entitled to then there is nothing left for me, you see.
                                </p>

                                <p>New Zealand appears to be some kind of Medical or Scientific Experiment (or Observational Study) in oppression.  I mean to say that New Zealand is refusing to train people in Medicine and refusing to fund Medical or Science (or even Philosophy or Social Science or even Arts) research, often, because (by the seems of it) they don't wnat to do anything to undermine the wrongful deathbrining.  THey are refusing to process applications to Medicine on the basis of the published criterion they have on how the applications will be processed.  Rather, the Universities (in both NZ and Australia) believe they have unlimited discretion to enrol (or not enrol) studnets for whatever arbitrary reasons they have.  They have chosen to use positions to preferentially enrol the children of certain high profile people.  Mostly (best I can figure) on political grounds.  For example, hiring children of research scientists so the children are, effectively, put to work collecting up samples for their parents science research (rather than doing clinical medicine in the service of the patients interests).  For example, working only to keep certain segments of society unhealthy and oppressed (e.g., by blaming the victim for problems arising from the governemnt choosing to keep them in oppressive environments -- particularly in state or government custody or 'care').  The Universities believe they have power to fail students for arbitrary or no good reason and also power to grant or confer qualfications on an honorary basis only (e.g., to people who did none of the work for them and who met no requirements for them).  They believe they have the power to rescind qualifications after they have  been awarded and so on. </p>

                                <p>Australasia cannot rightly claim to be part of the free and developed world. Look at how they choose to keep so many of their people.  They refuse to get students work to externl examiners so as to hold them hostage.  The Government is the major employer (private law firms, for example, seem to subsist on all the work the government gives them to defend the atrocities of the government) and they won't even process applications for employment.  THey won't even employ people.  They are keeping hostages.  They are killing people.  It does not matter what any of the laws are (it does not matter what teh Australian constitution says at all) because the Judiciary refuses to uphold the law.  Recently NZ appointed a whole bunch of retired High Court Judges back into office (rather than appointing new judges) so they could write that they don't see anything wrong.  E.g., with the unexplained death of Mason Pendrous.  E.g., with the Universities of NZ enrolling studnets in whatever they wanted (even if that means double and triple billing, even if that means invoicing student loans for courses the student never applied to be enrolled in) and also refusing to get theses out for external examination.  Australasian Universities do not get students work out to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit interntional community from signing off on the students qualification.  Qualifications from Australasian universities can't mean anything because of all the false negatives (not giving students qualifications when they have done their work) and who knows how many false positives (giving the children of the administration theses they have taken from other studnets who were bullied into fleeing with no credit).  There's nothing there...
                                </p>

                                <p>All these people who grubbity grub grubed their way into lucrative government jobs by the age of 25.  40 years later they don't want to walk away from their salaries.  It isn't like they actually do any work.  They can just tell their slaves to house sit for them and hand their work over to them so they can claim it for themselves or give it to their own children or give it to people who (they believe) will  never  be able to function independently of them.  They can stay on payroll and however many younger people can be shipped off to die overseas, that's a good idea.  Right?  Send off however many generations to be exterminated while continually cry cry cry cry crying about how the problem is that there aren't enough people, there aren't enough skilled people, one will have to just keep on collecting up allllllll of the money for oneself there aren't enough people, there aren't enough people, there aren't enough people.  The people need to go off to die, now, because the problem is that there aren't enough people to do all of the work for none of the pay and none of the credit and then they die, and then there needs to be new people to do all of the work for none of the pay and none of the credit and then we need to manufacture a war for them to go off and die in..  Or maybe a psychiatric facility where they can be detained in the name of their mental health...  Or maybe an 'education and training institution' where they can do all of the work for none of the pay and none of the credit.  When it is time to pay tehm / credit them / acknowledge them.  Well...  Over the dead bodies of their supervisors and the university administration.  Right?  Carefully handpicked for being most psychopathic.</p>

                                <p>How many Medical Students did Dr Leeks refuse to graduate / fail out of the Medical Training Programme / refuse to endorce for Psychiatry training or registration on the grounds that...  They had a problem with him trying to teach childrent to sexually respond to (enjoy and be happy) being sexually abused by the various adults whom he chose to pimp them out to?  How many not psychopaths needed to die or give up their lives so that he could do his 'good works' (to then be awarded or rewarded by re-deployment to Melbourne)?  There's nothing there..  In Australasia, I mean. The leaders here choose to keep the population here as a prison camp or detention facility for all the criminal offenders of the world.  So far as I can see...</p>

                                <p>Sloooooooooow doooooooooooown Keeeeeeeeeeelllllllllly  https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/478653/why-the-government-is-being-taken-to-court-to-challenge-new-zealand-s-outdated-mental-health-act  yoooooooou can pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for all of their crimes....  Slooooooowwwwwwww dooooooooooowwwwwwwn keeeeeeeeeellllllllllyyyyyyyyyy  What part of 'only 'treat' the involuntary or nonvoluntary or those sreaming out their protest and objection' is hard to understand?  People who *ask for* and *request* and *want* treatment can't have it  because there will never be enough to go around and by the time we have inflicted out 'treatment' upon however many people who are screaming at us to leave them the hell alone (or would be if we hadn't involuntariliy unlawfully drugged them with horse tranquiliser or magic muschrooms or round up or...) there's nothing left.  If it isn't state sanctioned and paid for abuse..  THen....  Why...  Nobody would want to do it, anymore.  It wouldn't be sooooo competitive.  If you don't get to helpl yourself to torturing vulnerable people then why oh why would anybody want to do that programme for????
