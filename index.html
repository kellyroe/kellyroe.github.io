 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>Of course there is the issue of quality. Academic quality.  The values were listed in the statute, even.  Academic values.  So actually the Universities of NZ don't get to make up stupid things like 'what we value the most is being the god child of the administration who are expediated because of their intrinsic leadership' like the daughter of the VC at Queensland.  What is she doing now, by the way?  A litlte wrongful deathbringing here?  A little sexual assaulting there?  How could she in good conscience not have just..  Kept applying.  YOu can do that, right?  Until you actually get entry on your merits.  Nonononono no  no.  Let's  be clear.  They wouldn't have wanted her any other way.  Who will work the death-camps?  </p>

                                <p>There is no working together to produce a quality research output.  Only shutting everything down.  If you show people your work they don't provide conscience comments on how it can be better.  They want you to change it so that it is different is all.  Shuffle things around.  So you aren't any closer to completion of it.  It's a delay procrastination thing.  When they write comments like 'you need to read just one more book'.  Because they can always tell you to read just one more book.  Add just one more reference.  Change x to y.  Then another supervisor says to change y to x.  Round and round.  Everything content changes new typoes are likely introduced.  So they get you to change content.  Then they say it will take  them months to get back to you with new comments.  Delay delay delay delay delay.  So teh quality...  What do you think the quality is going to be when your output is in spite of and despite and not because of.  When people are not trying to help you get it done to high quality on time at all.  When they are only working to undermine you.  It's sooooo comeptitive.  That's why everything is so f*cking garbage in NZ.  Becauase people aren't helpful at all.</p>

                                <p>What is the research output of Carolyn Mason and Justine Kingsbury and myself? What do they want to say?  The Universities of Waikatko and Canterbury?  They want to refuse to acknowledge my thesis.  Justine doesn't even want to work with me a little to get one chapter to a journal for co-authorship publication. She wouldn't work with me on a publication.  She was too busy apparently.  Okay.  So what did she do instead.  Let's have a look.  Did she do anything?  Where is it?  Carolyn Mason..  All the comments she wrote responding to my thesis.  Practically writing me another 50,000 words that I could copy and paste from her comments into my document and try nd get tht back to her, then, and see if she will accept her own writing as a PHD...  Was that the plan?  That's what happens to her research output is it?  She writes really really long comments on theses she's sent and..>  What???  The university hoards the studnets work and her comments  both and claims no research output?  Is that the idea?</p>

                                <p>The academics in NZ say they don't have academic freedom to talk about certain topics..  But it's more than that.  THey don't have academic freedom to produce anything.  They were intentionally hired, as best I can figure, to result in apoptosis of the entire thing.  Stabotage...  You would think.  These foreign hires, mostly they are actually foreign hires, who seem only interested in preventing and prohibiting any research output at all.  It's sooo competietive, apparently, the funding model.  A few people will be paid hundreds and hundreds of thousands per year and everyone else is, effectivley, enslaved.  That's teh business model.  The people on large payroll take the slave labor and put their own name on it.  Claim it as their own.  There's nothing really here...  The outputs can't compare with the outputs of less f*cking hostile environments.  Therefore seek out cooperation and eliminate it.</p>

                                <p>Who will write the judgments that they don't see anything wrong with anything the government does.  Or...  Tee hee..  Let's try this one...  We think the government did wrong.  But the people who drew everyones attention to that (filed with the courts) will pay all the costs involved in the proceedings, they will also have to pay their own lawyers.  They won't get any damages.  That will teach the people a lesson in how they will surely be punished for speaking abotu or drawing attention to the governments crimes.  That is the fucntion of Law in NZ society.  There we go...  Who wants to be a lawyer?  Who wants to be a judge, more to the point?  What do you think you will be allowed to do if you are willing to write judgments only to cover up the governments crimes?  If you agree to use the law as a weapon against the people (if you agree to be the personfication of injustice and corrupiton) then what can you do???  What can you do???  Let's think about this..  Let's have a think about what sort of reward Justice Toogood gets to not  be able to see anything wrong...</p>

                                <p>I guess the obvious one is that he prefers not to be retired.  Prefers to get to have his day in court.  Play judge.  watch the people bow before him and he enjoys gaslighting the victims.  Right.  I'm sure he's just delightful around children and infants...  What are you going to do?  Try and remove him from office?  He was not supposed to have been re-appointed in the first place.</p>

                                <p>NZ does not have a functioning judiciary.  Australia claims it's not it's jurisdiction for their Federal court to hear cases.  We don't have a judiciary.  They aren't prison camps up and down the land..  There isn't any law in these parts..  Theres nothing here...</p>

                                <p>It's just soooooo competitive. That's supposed to be the problem.  It's sooooooo competitive and I lose.  I see...  I was the only 120 point MPhil student that the University of Waikato had, in 2018?  Was I?  Probably yes...  Did anybody else in the entire country of NZ apply to do a 120 point MPhil?  Email me if you did apply and they told you that they couldn't enrol you because they decided you were 'ineligible'.  Probably they guilt and shame you into not speaking out about them having said that...  I mean if a place as crappy as Waikato thinks you are crap then there's no where lower to go -- right?  Anyway...  The nature of the competition...  Becomes clearer.  The Dean of the School of Graduate Research...  Students are to submit an electronic copy of their thesis along with a physical copy.  THey tried to say that I posted it to the wrong address so it didn't count as them having received it...  But the point is that the email records will show how much research gets sent from students to their supervisors and also from students to the administration.  ANd the emails from the Dean of teh School of Graduate Research...  Will show that she's not getting the studnets work out to externals.  And she's not telling or teaching the supervisors to get the work out to externals.  She seems to be trying to get the research school (necessary for the institutions status as a univesrity) to apoptose.  Close up shop.  Nothing there.  Nobody home.  No research output for the university.  I guess the idea is that she has a publication or two attributed to her name.  A PhD attributed to her name (whether or not it was externally examined I don't know)...  But likely she wants to undermine everybody else's research because that means in her eyes she is better than them.  If she can simply shut everybody else down..  Bully and shame the studnets and staff into not producing anything.  Sometimes they even like to arranage these work-camps where you are supposed to sit with others in a supervised environment and work for 20 minutes before a yakkity yak yak break.  These are graduate studnets...  Who were outputting how many words per year as first years and second years and third years and fourth.  And you took their writing samples and enrolled them in graduate research qualifications...  And then you took their research output and bullied anad bullied and bullied them into keeping on producing research output while you never got to to externals and never acknoweldged any of it.  More and more and more and more and more money from teh government to keep hostages or slaves.  What university?  </p>

                                <p>Still waiting on the Social Security Appeals Authority.  Not willing or able to output a judgment in a timely fashion.  Hurry up.  F*cking hurry up.  What are you going to do now?  The courts are going to rule that justice is not an 'essential need' are they?  Well then, close the courts down.  They have decided to apoptose.  Where is the judgment?  Hurry up.  FInd in the interests of justice else get the f*ck out.</p>

                                <p>Oh.  We don't have a judiciary.  Nobody home.  The Judges will not find in the interests of justice.  They were appointed by the government to cover up the governments crimes.  There is no judiciary.</p>

                                <p>I suppose, to be fair...  THe political leaders have been regarded 'anti-intellectual' -- but you have to look at who the people were, at the time, who were considered to be the intellectuals.  And the ideas that they had.  I guess.  To understand what it meant to be anti-intellectual around the time when the political leaders of NZ were proclaimed to be...  I don't really know much about the research output of NZ...  It always seemed to me...  Well, when I was at Secondary School and perhaps also University I preferred things other than NZ literature.  It did not seem to me that the quality of the NZ literature was as high as the other stuff.  I wasn't sure why...  Maybe just a personal preference.  I guess the thing is that what I considered to be good or what I liked was different from those who had power to decide such things in NZ.  I guess they are more focused on...  Personal things.  I don't know.    </p>

                                <p>Arts can be a way of money laundering, I guess.  Instead of giving a bunch of money to someone and it being considered a bribe or whatever you can pay a bunch of money for a dubious work of art.  Or claim to have funded an arts scholarship for a particular person.  Persons wife or child or whatever.  I suppose.  I guess that would make sense of how the quality tracking gets undermined, subservient to other interests.  Corruption.  Wouldn't pay Janet Frame enoguh to live independently.  Right?  Paid some psychiatrist to keep her as a personal slave?  That's the way teh Arts funding goes..  Did she get any recognition as an artist in her lifetime or did they wait for her to die before they decided her literary output was good enough to teach the kiddies in the schools and universities and so on?  A little lesson in what happens when it's time for them to pay you to teach.  Then it's time for you to be put away in an institution.  Of course.  Why pay you when they can pay some Professor of the Glue Factory to do their best to turn you into Glue ASAP.  Only game in town.</p>

                                <p>There is something called the 'surprise principle'.  I don't remember particularly.  But there is a game you can play...  Would it be more surprising to you if x or y were the case...  So, for example, consider how people microchip their pets.  So the technology is there.  Now...  Would it be more surprising if human beings were microchipped or not microchipped?  What do you think?  Maybe not all of them...  HOw about the ones kept on incubators when they are really really young?  The ones who have been identified as vulnerable targets?  Some of the ones who have been...  I was wondering...  I was thinking about things being implanted into bone.  The easiest way to do that en masse would to do it with a wisdom tooth extraction.  If you put a little packet of something in there the jaw bone literally grows over it.  So...  That's a good reason why you tell everybody that they need to or they should have their wisdom teeth removed as a matter of course.  The opportunity to do that.  I would imagine or suppose.  It is actually important who gets picked out to do these things...  With respect to civil servants and public accountability and so on.  Else..  If the leaders of NZ are making soverign decisions to run this part of the world as a slave or prison camp...  To sell out the health of the people.  Treating people as disposable garbage...  Well, they aren't fit to lead.  Nobody would voluntarily vote for any of that.  What people? </p>

                                <p>What was the NZ leadership response to the *idea* of Japan releasing potentially nuclear contaminated water into the oceans?  What did they have to say about the idea that that might happen?  Did they think to express concern about the environmental impact and ask Japan to try and figure how to do the right or responsible thing?  Did the leadership of NZ try and interact with Japan as a...  Civilised nation of civilised people?  Or did it expect something different from the leadership of Japan?  DId the leadership of NZ say 'well, it's nothing that we wouldn't be doing.  If we could push all our dairy sludge into the oceans then we'd get right on that until who and whose army will stop us'.  When the leadership of NZ learned that nobody held the English to account for their role in the Irish famine...  What was the leadership response?  Did they see that, then, as as an aspirational ideal on the way to new lows?  The 'how low can we go' game?  Now we hae stopped with the 'lowest prices guaranteed' and started with trying to starve people...  It's supposed to incentivise them to shut up, apparently or allegedly.  Doesn't really make any sense.  The frontal lobe deficit thing...</p>

                                <p>I do think NZ has a special problem of only employing people who don't do the job for which tehy are paid which makes it easy, then, to remove them from office and not pay anybody to do it, then, and nothing is any worse off.  In fact, the quality and integrity of NZ universities would likely be higher without Chris Whelan as the CE of the NZVCC since without meetings of the NZVCC and so on the universities couldn't get their heads together and figure out how to keep getting more and more and more money for student hostages, slaves, or dead bodies, even.  Why not just enrol people who you already know are dead?  you can just keep re-enrolling them forever and ever for more and more money...  Get paid from the government to keep them in 'residential halls' when they are already dead.  Quite the precedent...  They suicided all voluntary-like, apparently.  Say the only medical doctors you acknowledge as such.  Nobody else was allowed to graduate NZ Universities.</p>

                                <p>I am not sure where I heard...  But I think it was a finding in psychology...  About how the worst thing for many people was retirement.  Police and so on.  Government workers, I think.  About how they might gripe about their job a bit, but they'd been doing it for however many years.  It got them up in the morning.  It gave them people to interact with in the course of their job etc.  Then, when they retired, they didn't have a reason to get up anymore.  They lost the will to live.  They died.  Of course, there is an incentive for them to die, once they have retired.  Pension payments that need to be made no more.  But the point is that many people don't actually want to retire, at all.  They would rather stay on payroll until they day they die.  Particularly when their job involves them having power over others they don't want to give it up.  For example...  Who wouldn't want to stay on as Judge if one was being paid a lot to do that...  Particularly (and is unclear to me) when you don't even need to write judgments.  Not sure who writes the judgments that are outputted from the apparent or alleged courts of NZ...  So...  If the GPs who are nearing the age of retirement simply refuse to ackowledge anybody who has the capacity to replace them then...  I guess the government will just have to keep on paying the present GPs?  Till the day they die.  No job for anybody else till the day they die.  The equality idea and the idea of sharing...  Never really caught on, in this part of the world.  Would rather have slavers and an underclass even if it is a matter of luck.  Then enjoy your luck for as long as your luck lasts and then it's time to go away.  Nasty bruitish and short.  Something something about how you don't live longer...  Just feels like it.  Better to have lived and die young than not to have lived at all or whatever.  Better to enjoy your time being a bully grubbing up everything for yourself...  It's soooooo competitive because it's a matter of life and death, literally.  And nobody wants to live, like that. </p>

                                <p>They have been saying for years and years and years and years and years now that there is a problem of GPs being due to retire in the next few years and they aren't training enough to replace them.  The problem is that they don't want to give up their positions so they aren't going to sign off on completion of anybody else's training.  They won't train anybody else because they want to be the only game in town.  Justice Toogood was recently reappointed as a Judge.  He was past the age of retirement, but he got reappointed to cover up the Government's crimes.  Not see anything wrong with the death of Olivia Podmore in State Care.  She was in the Cambridge Elite Cycling program.  Right?  Specal SChool.  And she died in State care.  They didn't pay her enough to live independently.  Right?  She died, in state care.  Mason Pendrous also died in State Care.  Canterbury University was being paid a bunch of money to provide him with tertiary level education and they didn't even notice he'd been rotting for a month.  He died in state care.  And Justice Toogood gets payrolled out of retirement to write up how he can't see anything wrong with any of this.  The GPs also are hoping that they won't be retired.  Put out to pasture.  They still have many many many years of life left in them.  Telling their patients 'there is nothing I can do' and being generally racist etc.  Refusing to train anybody else (yikes to the only kind of training they could or would provide anyhoo).  Refusing most espsecially to get out of the f*cking way to actually let someone else do the job for which they are paid.  Everybody get behind Professor Glue and his Glue Factory.  We haven't got to the point where government institutions are to be anything other than punative.  Punishment.  For the crime of  being born in NZ.  </p>

                                <p>Alright... So... Once upon a Time various nz officials thought there was money to be had in teh 'one child' policy of China whereby the aim of the game was to poison one child and tehn win by only game in town becuse the competiton had been eliminated.  We can identify it for the NZ strategy that it is.  And so, subsequently, NZ has tried to market dairy to China (for example( thinking they can tap into a leadership psychopathy tht will seek to eliminate the competion by all means avaialabe to them.  How mcuh will they pay for contaminated dairy for the people etc??? Only game intown...</p>

                               <p>Okay.  So I didn't choose the game that everyone was playing.  And I didn't have any say, all, at whether they chose to play nice.  I handed in one year of work and that was handed to Carolyn Mason of the University of Canterbury.  Also some academic from Canada who has been deemed 'subsequently retired'.  So the academic from Canterbury (Caroline Mason) says that in her professional opinion I did not produce enough in the 2028 academic year to be credited with 1 year of graduate student research output.  So...  What did she produce, then, in the 2018 year that meant that she got alllllllllll the research funding for everything that was produced in that year? I sqy again  twenty eighteen acadmic year.  Tweenty eigiteen.  As an English speaker of English...  What was her output then that mine can be compared agsinst such that you pay her (not me)??? Where is her research output???  Not the game I signed up for.  She would be paid no other way.  Where is her research output?  Maybe put her on disability.  She's not competent of research output.  Why does she get paid?</p>

                                <p>How many years did Dave Wall thesis write for the ANU before they got his thesis out for external examination?  Did they ever?  Or, only after they declared him 'incapacitated never to  be employed in the field' would they claim that he had done enough for a PhD so he could be deported back, now, from the lands from whence he came...  How  many years of thesis writing did he do for the ANU before he was given glucose before vitamins in the hospital to induce wernicke ecephalopathy and coma?  I'm wondering how many years of thesis writing he did for the ANU before things got to the point of them hospitalising him (and claiming, then, that he wasn't in his right mind and how could he complete a research thesis!!)  It's sooooo competitive.  The lengths they go to to ensure that the likes of Sterelny is the only game in town.  I did have psychotherapy while I was in Canberra.  The aim of it seemed to  be to personalise everything.  So, if I was saying that I was finding it difficult how they were doing the question time (bullying people, basically, rather than being professional in the way that they were questioning people about their work) then I should take medication.  And so on.  It was always about me writing more and me doing more and me giving more and more and more and how could I be induced to do and give more and more and more.  For less and less and nothing.  Actually.  To be kept by Justine Kingsbury giving her all my work while the Univerity claims more and more and more and more and more fees from teh governmetn to take my work and do who knows what with it.  Give it away.  Give it to external exaiminers. For them to, presumably, give to their own students.  The Australasian Universities seemed to think that the problem with some overseas institutions is that they hadn't caught our particular kind of kuru induced prion disease -- yet.  So, when externals were going to sign off on completion the Universities of NZ say 'silly sausage, why don't we conspire together to not sign off on completion of any of our studnets work.  To simply keep them as forever slaves?  Else they can curl up and die.  I mean, what are they going to do about it?  Them and whose army?  </p>

                                <p>The Dean of teh Research SChool of Social Science, University of Waikato..  She's allegedly a PhD graduate from University of Nottingham.  Right?  Who were the external examiners on her thesis?  Who signed her off?  Seriously..  Who signed her off?  Where are the research theses from the University of Waikato?  the 1 year research theses.  Where are they?  The three year research theses.  Where are they?  How about Aucklaknd Uni.  Even the Australian National.  Where is Carl Bursse's research output for every year of his enrolment.  They kept him enrolled.  Where is the research output that justified them having kept him enrolled?  Why didn't that go out to externals?  They are functioning as a slave or prison detention camp.  Not a university.  Not producing doctors, lawyers.  Not producing acadmics.  Not producing anything at all.  Theres nothing there.</p>

                                <p>How did they mess up the Excel charts?  They changed the formula that they used to do the automated calculation.  Who changed it? Why?  I mean, you change the formula until you get the output you want (you meet the target of 95 per cent) in stupid land where people often don't have the capacaity to focus on target but even if they did wouldn't have the capacity to assess whether the way of arriving at it was fair or legitimate.  The aim or goal or point or purpose was to say that 100 per cent of people who presented to the ED were seen within 6 hours by...  I don't know, taking everybody who arrived out back and shooting them within 5?  That would get you your target.  Right?  Right National Government?  Or did the target mean that the hospital was allowed to keep 5 per cent of the arrivals involuntariliy detained in conditions of torture?  Was that the aspirational ideology?</p>

                                <p>Sigh.  I don't think Max Rashbrooke gets it yet.  It isn't that the government wants people to have housing or healthcare or justice.  The government believes in 'trickle down economics' which means everything is a hierarchy and the aim is to eliminate the competition and be a winner in that way.  How do you get to be a winner?  It's a two-parter.  You have a house - and other people don't.  If everybody has a house then that undermines or devalues your having a house.  You see?  A viable solution to the problem of 'how to win at life' is to keep as many others poorly and badly as possible.  The more slaves or hostages you have the better you have done.  The sicker your slaves or hostages are the better you have done.  It's all relative, you see?  How many times do your first year students need to tell you that 'it's all relative' until you understand?  One only gets to be a winner if everybody else is declared to be a loser.  It's sooooo competitive.  Do you understand, yet?  </p>

                                <p>I suppose Rashbrook has a house and spends I don't know how much on drycleaning.  It's a costly-signal to indicate that you don't have the capacity to do your own laundry, or something, apparently or allegedly, in these lands...  They tolerate him because..  I don't know.  Who his parents were, or something, I suppose.  </p>

                                <p>It was rather interesting that Carolyn Mason was accusing me of going on and on about what Rashbrook said (only) without accepting or acknowledging that he was an editor of an edited collection.  I guess that shows that Carolyn Mason thinks that being an editor for a collection means that you carefully curate the content of the collection such that you are...  Personally responsible for the contents of the collection. I mean, she seemed to think that the resonsibiltiy for the content was with Rashbrooke because he was the editor.  Can you hear the difference between the quality of the content and whether you like or agree with what is said?  Have you not see wonderful pieces of academic work that turn out to be wrong, for various reasons?  I don't understand why these people who are appointed to teach critical thinking and critical reasoning seem to be some of the worst people at it who I have encountered.  They go on and on and on about how their studnets don't have the capacity to do it...  But after I don't know how many years of being gaslit by foreigners who have been redeployed here into both academic positions and positions in university administration...</p>

                                <p>I am trying to think...  Trying to udnerstand...  My memory of Justine Kingsbury back when I was a Masters level student (writing on extending Marsha Linehan (Washington's) work on DBT from treating 'borderline' to treating florid delusions...  Was that she was sensible and had interesting research on teleosemantics which was a fashionable topic that was relatively current at the time...  So...  What happened?  Did my standards or expectations go up?  Or did something happen to her...  Or both, I guess...  </p>

                                <p>Quite a lot happened with me...  I got exposed to a lot more philosophy people and a lot more idea.  Having conversations with them about work in progress.  Instead of only hearing about work that had been done however many years ago.  I mean..  It's the difference between a 'definitive edition' of a computer game and a 'buggy on release'.  What is a PhD thesis supposed to be?  It is supposed to be a  3 year project.  A... Beta test on your career?  The alpha test being hour honors year.  Where you wrote around 50,000 words that was deemed to be of sufficient quality for you to proceed to PhD.  So your PhD is then supopsed to be 3 years of work.  That gets externally examined, again, to see if the quality is high enough for more funding.  But instead we have people who produce nothing who proclaim that everything they see is garbage.</p>

                                <p>Nobody is allowed to produce anything.</p>

                                <p>So, anyway, back to Rashrook bearing responsibility for the content of what the authors of the articles in his collection had to say...  That seemed to be what Carolyn Mason thought.  That it was not responsible of me to be citing from different articles in an edited collection because he bore sole responsibiltiy.  I don't know.  She didn't make a lot of sense.  I don't know why she thought that her job was to expend so much energy and effort writing practicaly a thesis in response to a 120 point masters thesis.  I mean..  All the time and energy she put into being oppositional was time and energy that wasn't going into her own research output.  I mean..  If mine came out in a timely fashion... Couldnt' she work her criticism of it up into a proper respose?  Then I could respond to her response. Then that is 3 resesarch outputs.  My masters.  Her response.  My response to her response.  That's academic research output.  If I'm wrong then maybe people will agree with her.  That's support for her.  That's good for her -- right?  But no no no no no no no there is nothign there.  Apparently in order to show respet for Justine they needed to fail me.  And Justine needs to be shown a little respect.  I think the University administration gave her a promotion (to something something on the scholarships committee) after they realised that I was going to be enrolled in a masters degree (not a doctoral degree) for no scholarship for me.  Their grubby greedy eyes all lit up as they thoguht about how to roll that out to populations...  All of the research funding for them to keep slaves.</p>

                                <p>Pharmaceutical Company Funding</p>

                                <p>I don't think that NZ prescribes much in the way of Medicines from the US that are being manufactured and sold under patient over there.  We tend to go for the cheaper generics that are manufactured in companies we like to call 'developing'.  That is to say India (I think that is a big one), also Malaysia.  Maybe China?  Are NZ doctors even authorised to prescribe medicines that are still under patient in the US?  I am not sure that they are...  How do they get the medicines into the country that are not Pharmac approved?  Can they?  I don't think that there is a great deal of pressure on NZ clinicians from US Pharmaceutical companies.  Pressure to run clinical trials (experiments) without having to worry about any legal repercussions, of course.  But I don't think that US Pharmaceutical Companies are focused on trying to make money off of selling patient medications to NZers...</p>

                                <p>When my mother was diagnosed with cancer her specialist (allegedly or apparently, I never met  him and never had the opportunity to look into whether he was actually qualified or whatever) prescribed for her medication that was not pharmac approved.  It was coming in from Bangladesh.  I think he was from there...  She said that she had trouble understanding what he was saying some of the time because his English wasn't very good...  But she also had a hard time listening, sometimes, so hard to know about that.  But it did seem...  Suspicious?  To me that a supposed or apparent specialist was recommending this particular medication for my mother (more than one thousand dollars per month) when it was supposed to be a last resort treatment (but had been prescribed as a first line before any other treatment had been offered or tried to the best of my knowledge) and the medication was coming in from his...  Home town?</p>

                                <p>Was he NZ trained?  I'm not sure.  I wonder how many patients he was prescribing this non-pharmac medication for?  I wonder if there was another version of it that was produced in the US.  My mother ended up becoming paralysed.  Apparently because of the cancer.  But I wondered about neurotoxicity from over-prescritpion of the medciation.  My MOther said that the consultant was pleased with how the medication was workign and encouraged her to take as much medication as she could tolerate.  She thought the symptoms of peripheral nerve tingling etc were because of the cancer so she needed to take a higher dose of the medicine.  She didn't think that she was taking too much medicine and the medicine was causing the tingling and paralysis.  SHe didn't think that the medicine was poisoning her nervous system...  He didn't seem to explain to her about the difference between cancer symptoms and medication symptoms...</p>

                                <p>Of course I tried to raise...  But people dont listen to me...  So..  That is their choices and their decisions, I guess.  Some people don't want to live.  That seems right.  I'm sure that many Jewish people and so on were so f*cking sick and tired of living on concentration camps they happily marched off for a long rest all voluntary-like.  Who knows...  I encouraged her to get a second opinion and she had opportunity and she wouldn't.  I offered to accompany her and she didn't want me to.  So...  I wasn't going to encourage her to live when I wasn't going to move in with her and care for her.  She had money.  She could have paid someone to care for her, if she wanted to be cared for...  Whatever.  Her decision is her own.</p>

                                <p>My interest is more that there are people who actually want and expect competent health system and that isn't happening.  If my mother hadn't have sort of willingly taken massive doses of this medication made in Bangladesh that wasn't pharmac approved..  Well, maybe they would have simply forced her to, anyway.  Also..  Just because they say she can see another consultalnt for a second opinion (lot of Waikato people had that because of the stuff up over hte health records -- maybe she even could have had radiation treatment in Australia) she did not persue any of that.  But if she had have persued any of that maybe they would then have said 'haha not for you anyway'.  Hard to know.  Anyway...  At some point she had magic marker marks on her.  Apparently they were little x's from where tehy were doing radiation treatment.  They only did one lot of radiation treatment then she died.  I think they said it was supposed to help her get better...  But it seemed to me that it was simply one dose of it to finish her off more quickly.  THey magic markered her esophagus (about where the esophageal sphincter is) and on the left side of her face.  To the left of her eye socket.  Language production?  Or is that further back?  Then she's nill by mouth and they suddenly stop the oral medicines that she had been taking.  She was on a lot of anti-acids.  Protease pump inhibitors.  Suddenly stop them.  So acid reflux.  Together with paralysis from teh neuropathy...</p>

                                <p>It matters really rather a lot how they select the Medcial Students.  How they decide who is to graduate.  If they pay the doctors.  What doctors?  We refuse to train a workforce.  Insist on staffing or stocking the hospitals with various people from overseas.  Do we pay them?  I don't think we are paying them, are we?  They are getting their money from various other things...  My mother was paying more than a thousand per month for the cancer medications.  But that might have incentivised the specialist to keep her on them for longer and longer..  I don't know...</p>

                                <p>I do know that they don't seem to be trying to be fair or do things properly.  They seem to choose to employ people to cover up their crimes.  Instead of paying people to get on with things.  They won't allow people to get on with things.  They would rather me do this all f*cking day...  Than get me into the training, progressing through, actually working with patients.  They won't let anybody work that job.  They would rather pay various law firms and various judges to find in the insterest of injustice sot hat they can keep on keeping on staffing the universities with people woh dont produce any f*ckign research output.  The non-productive people holding studnets as hostages or slaves because you tell them that if they don't do that then...  Then what will you do with them?  If Justine can't  / won't produce research every year she is on payroll to produce research then what is to be done with her?  Oh..  Maybe she'd then be kept by the government the way the governmetn chooses to keep me.  Is that the thing?  But her husband is payrolled so it isn't like it would make that much difference to her life.  Right?  Why doesn't she publish with Tim Dare, tehn?  They could write articles together on how the Governemnt needs to keep records on who the vulnerable children are and uplift them into being abused by the government for the childrens own good or somethign.  It's practically morally compulsory.  I guess they are the only publications they will allow him to have.  To put his name (as the ethics guy) down on whaetver it is that they want to do (whatever crimes tehy want to continue on with) and also to publish things in the New Zealand Medical Students Journal.  Of course.  You have to print on high gloss paper and strew about the place a Students Journal that's full of articles written by Professors who didnt study Medicine, at all.  I guess because they can't get publications otherwise.  And damned if their studnets are going to get any publications since they cant get them.  Nobody else will.  Not on their watch.</p>

                                <p>What is the point?  Various immigrants (e.g. the Dean of the Research School University of Waikato) like to treat Justine like garbage.  Apparently because she doesn't have a research output.  So that means she's always fighting constntly to even keep her job.  Just hanging in there as the dregs.  They can treat her  badly and that's fun.  Suck up and kick down.  They like to kick her.  I guess you don't need to pay them when they can hve their fun kicking her.  I don't know if she used to produce research and then they were just so f*ckign horrible to her that she stopped showing them her research work.  They were horrible to her not because the work was bad...  I mean, if you sent it to people to assess it's academic quality or merits and they didn't know how much people just love to kick at her then they wouldn't say the quality was bad...  But you have these f*cking bullies like Kim Sterelny who gets to decide who he likes to go camping with..  And that's what academic merits is or means, then.  It means the people he likes to go camping with.  The people who gladly house sit forhim if he picks them out as special to do that.  Anyway...  There isn't anything here...  No University because they won't allow the work to be externally examined.  It has to go out with a little note saying 'if you respect me (as this studnets supervisor) then you won't accept this research thesis from my studnet.  Since, nobody accepts my research work nobody can accept my studnets.  Since I don't accept my students.  Only way I accept my studnet is if I replace them with me.  But you don't accept me.  So hahshhsahhahahahah we can stagnate in the swamp together'.  No way out.  No way through.  </p>

                                <p>Philosophy at the ANU?  I think most of the people employed to do philosophy there...  Were any of them actually signed off by externl examiners?  Did their work actually get externlly examined on it's academic merits?  Were they really the best hires you could recruit?  Or was everybody else bullied away so all you were left with was 'there is no alternative' and 'only game in town'?  They would't do the fair process thing.  Throwing away applications, throwing away completed theses, not getting work to externals.  Letting the academics on payroll keep slaves or hostages.  The Administration knew about that.. . Knew that Carl Brusse had been enrolled in a PhD for...  How many years?  But they had various work outputs from him.  Why didn't they simply get his work (the work that he had done) out to externals when it was time for htem to do that?  They won't do it.  They aren't interested in furthering those with capacity at all.  They are only interested in having bullies keep hostages and slaves to the ruin of the whole f*cking thing.</p>

                                <p>I guess they would never have hired Sterelny if he wasn't the biggest bully in teh town.  So, from his point of view he has nothing to lose.  He can only win.  If he's removed from office he probably never would have been there in the first place, so nothing to lose.  Terrorist.  That's what he is and that's what he does.  F*cking terrorising how many people into dropping out nd going away.  Throwing away applications for people to study, people to graduate, people to apply for positions int eh department even.  I'm sure.  I suppose it serves the interests of the scohols in the US to undermine the public system of Australia completely.  The lower they go the better the US looks, by comparison or something.  Of course.  Instead of focusing on how to be better we can just have fun keeping hostages and slaves kick kick kickign down.  For as long as we are getting away with it.</p>

                                <p>Overtaken by psychopaths. There's nothing there. I hear you, Sterelny.  You and only you.  Of course.   How are your cats doing?  Did they die already?  Did you remember to buy them food when you went awy on holiday?</p>

                                <p>-----</p>

                                <p>They have this mooting competition in Auckland for the first year studnets.  The second year private school boys like to manage / administrate / run it.  It gives them the joy of getting to put on fancy suits and also the joy of getting to play judge.  To judge the mooters to pick and choose who gets selected to proceed or progress into further rounds.  Then there is a final where the alumni turn up to have a chortle snort about how dashing this one or that one looks and how just like his father...  It's very...  Illuminating.  Shall we say.  It helps first year studnets decide whether or not law is something they might want to pursue.  Actually, it just is incredibly blatant about informing them how there is actually (there actually is) nothing there.  Corruption.</p>

                                <p>I suppose, to be fair, similar situation occurs with the way they handle Medicine.  Just nastiness thing.  E.g., telling people only a few days or hours before Medsci142 examinations that they have or have not been selected for Medical interview.  The kids who were always going to be selected have that as a nice mental boost before the exam.  To help faciliate bringing out their best performnce.  The kids who were always going to be pissed on by the former are put in their place in a way that is intentionally designed to be undermining.  The University can play stupid about why they pick that particular timing to inform the students of that fact...  I think it may have changed within the last few years only...  But prior to that they were notifying studnets whether they had been offered enrolment in medicine (or waitlisted or not offered enrolment) until midnight on 24 December. </p>

                                <p>Why?  Much love for Daddy for buying precious everything they wanted for Christmas?   Much crying to the relations about how they had been waitlisted.  Come on.  Isn't there something anyting anyting anything anything that someone can do?  How do you convert a wait list offer into an actual offer?  How much money does that cost?  So we cn all understand why we don't have a functioning health system...  By design.</p>

                                <p>https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/politics/lawyers-looking-after-lawyers-panel-says-strip-law-society-of-powers-to-discipline/  The Law Society is not upholding professional standards.  Not any more than the Justices are upholding Justice.  I mean, what do you expect?  Una Jagose thinking the function of Crown Law is to close ranks about and protect the crimes of the Crown, and all. </p> 
                                <p>There was a particular Professor who was going along to the law camps at Otago trying to teach the second year law students about appropriate conduct, or whatever.  You know how it is, the (particularly male) children of the administration get to run around naked and generally behave like apes and do anything anything anything anything they want...  When they started saying that this kind or sort of behavior at camps was inappropriate -- they redeployed him to Auckland.  He's a law Professor at the University of Auckland now, isn't he?  That was his promotion.  As Dr Leeks was promoted to Melbourne, this guy was promoted to Auckland.  If you put in an OIA for information they should be required to tell you how much increase of public salary he is paid now (as Professsor in Auckland rather than Dunedin) as...  How are we supposed to think of it?  As a reward for his many  years of building the Dunedin law camp into everything it became?  Does Auckland have law camps?  I'm not sure...  I think they have medical camps...  One can only imagine what sorts of things goes on in those...</p>

                                <p>New Zealand and Australia undermine themselves.  They won't get students work to external examiners so that it can be externally examined on it's academic merits.  They aren't even pretending to be academic institutions concerned with academic merits.  They aren't processing applications to enrol, progressions through training, qualification completions properly, much of the time.  They aren't advertising jobs, selecting from applicants on the basis of skills and experience, paying them properly.  They aren't doing anything properly.  They just redeploy people into position so they can ensure that the job for which they are paid is not actually performed by anybody at all.  There is nothing here.  </p>

                                <p>The leaders apparently choose (exerting their own soverignty) to run Australasia like a slave, prison, or detention camp.  They aren't at all even trying to be fair.  No conception of fairness, even.  Lacking the cognitive capacity.  It's all sooooooo competitive.  It's soooooo competitive that they throw applications away and refuse to get work to externals and refuse to graduate so that we are left with the 'only game in town' and 'there was no alternative'.</p>


                                <p>The leaders of NZ have never been known or regarded as intellectuals.  They have always been regarded as anti-intellectuals.  The least well educated civil service and government in the world.  Not just because we refuse to allow the education system to develop (e.g., refuse to build 3 year degrees into 4 year degrees, refuse to build 5 year PhD's from 3 year PhD's.  Refuse to develop the teaching curriculum.  Refuse to develop course contents.  Refuse to teach and externally examine course contents.  Refuse to allow new research to see the light of day.  Function as a prison slave or detention camp.  Simply refusing to graduate students).  The government preferentially hired graduates after 3 or 4 years of university study (only) to the civil service.  Preferring them to be younger and less knowledgeable and less experienced.  Preferring them to be the chidren of those already employed thinking they most likely to work to cover up the crimes of their forefathers.  The idea was that they needed the Ministers to be able to understnd the reports.  They couldn't rely on the reading age or comprehension of the ministers being much more than them being able to read the abstract or table of contents.  So the reports say the same thing over and over and over and over and over.  So the Ministers don't need to read the reports.  The reports can only say what the Ministers said already so that the Ministers can claim to understand the reports.   </p>

                                <p>This preference for the youngest and stupidist being the most desirable.  The most 'trainable'.  To make the senior people feel competent.  To work to cover up their crimes only.  Great way to run a country..  Into the ground.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>People come back from overseas with knowledge and skills and the leaders from here refuse to acknowledge them or allow them to function or contribute.  Because the f*cking stupid is too f*cking stupid.  And they know it.  They never would have been appointed into position if they had have been anything else.  Intentionally deployed to ensure the prevention and prohibition of development in the slave colony prison camp detention facility lands.  Not even trying to develop.  Everything they can to prevent and prohibit it and follow as slowly behind dragging the heels every step of the way.  Retard-land.  People kept retarded.  There is nothing here.</p>

                                <p>There aren't any universities because they aren't processing the applications to enrol properly.  They aren't progressing people through their qualifications.  They aren't graduating all and only the people who did the work they were supposed to for the qualification.  They aren't paying the workers.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>What is a GP supposed to do, exactly?  Let's have a think about that, so we can understand why it is desirable to pick out teengers when they are 18 for that one.  Firstly, they say 'we will get an assistant to the nurses assistant to take a sample and send it to the labs' because you can't diagnose very many things without pathology reports.  Secondly, they say 'it is probably a virus therefore there is nothing we can do so no antibiotics for you go way' (that was a big one, prior to 2018).  Thirdly, they say 'hmm.  We better watch and wait and see what happens.  Come back to me again if things get worse'.  That way they get more money for repeat visits, at least.  Fourthly, they say 'go to the ED'.  Fifthly, they say 'that's outside my scope of practice so I'll put you on the waitlist to see a specialist'.  What else does a GP do, in NZ?  The assistant to the nurses assistant (likely the unpaid student doing their internship) does the blood pressure and so on.  So what are GPs for, exactly?  What is it that they do?  Aside from telling people that healthcare is not for them by delay delay delay delay until they die, of course.  Which is basically the same function as the judiciary.  And basically everything else in NZ.</p>

                                <p>My understanding was that the reason why a lot of Medical Graduates (though, not sure that there are any, anymore) did not want to do GP specialist training and work as a GP was because.  Well, firstly you have to be accepted to study with the GP people.  They don't seem to have exams that can be studied for, exactly.  I don't know how they pick who gets to train with them.  Their children are likely to cover for them, I suppose, but aside from them...  So there isn't really much in the way of curriculum contents or external exams.  So then you are, um...  Hostage?  Do we call it?  To the people who are supposed to  be training you.  What do they do with you?  Put you to work for low levels of pay (you pay them for being a student) and they refuse to sign you off because then you would have to be paid more but they don't want you to be paid they want themselves to be paid and it's sooooooo competitive.  So they aren't going to sign you off.  You can do all of the work and they will collect all of the pay.  Maybe one day, when they turn 90 or 120 they will die and then you can replace them and keep your own slaves for the remainder of your life.  They'll have to die before there would be a job for you!  It's sooooooooo competitive!!!  </p>

                                <p>Of course there is a lot more that GPs could be doing.  For example, our death by skin cancer rates are really high, and most people in NZ don't have regular physical exams.  For all the non-consenting groping that the medical studnets are expected to do and the liberties they are expected to take once people have been anesthetised for unrelated procedures there is actually a dearth of competent physical health checkups.  The basic lack of medical check ups and preventative care and so on.  I suppose that's because we don't actually want the people to live.  It's soooooooo competitive, and all.</p>

                                <p>Is someone really doing their PhD thesis on attachment and how people attach to cats, or similar?  Who is supervising that one?  I'm curious because I was interested in psychoanalytic / dynamic / attachment stuff for a while there and I didn't see any university academics in NZ doing any research along the lines of any of that.  It surprises me that there would be.  We are basically doing 'Brave New World' types of interventions trying to breed or raise a slave class of Gamma babies by design.  Raising them in Fisher and Paykal incubators.  After having induced premature delivery in the name of 'for their own good' so as to interrupt attachment.  Sort of raise them as Harry Harlow primate research laboratory babies.  Run this social engineering experiment out of New Zealand.  Of course.  So the graduates from Harvard can come visit and see how the Harry Harlow primates are doing and see Rheumatic Fever in the wild etc.  Are our leaders really too stupid to see any of this for what it is?  Too stupid by design?  Una Jagose tells you everything you need to know about NZs attitude to this kind of thing.  Easier to conceal it (easier to work to undermine the public interest) if people from NZ aren't allowed to study attachment and so on.  So the judges can order the babies to be kept on incubators and the mothers to be imprisoned for the babies own good (and not because of the perversions of the likes of Dr Leeks).  Yeah, right.  </p>

                                <p>I do remember some documentary on cats.  They thought that cats were solitary and dogs were pack animals, you see.  Dogs fit into a pecking order social hierarchy with people.  Cats are a bit different.  But there was some documentary.  Following housecats who were wild or semi feral?  I don't quite remember.  Anyway, it showed that the kittens were, actually, very social.  As anybody knows who has ever had 2 kittens.  Cats, generally, are very social as people who have more than 2 cats will know.  They are just different from dogs for various reasons.  Of course humans intentionally select for the qualities that we value in domesticated animals.  They are selected for our projecting certain things onto them...  Their function is to entertain us?  They are dependent...  You can learn a lot about a person from how they keep their dependents.  How they look after their cats...  If they expect their grad students to look after their cats for them while they go off on holiday and never get their grad studnets work out for external examination, for example.  So they can stay and look after their cats forever, presumably.  Or just die, then.  Not apply for any government research funding.  Of course.  Not when Sterelny is the only game in town.  The hostile world of sex and death and the seeking out and destroying of anything that starts to look like it might evolve into co-operation.</p>

                                <p>Attachment, yes..  Indeed...  Also projection.  People sometimes project stuff onto an external object.  Stuff they don't know how to metabolise otherwise.  By projecting it externally they can consider it more objectively.  Like that advertisement there used to be on TV about the snowball that gets bigger and bigger and then they show someone holding it in the palm of their hand.  Perspective.  Um...  You did call the cat fleabus.  The cat didn't choose her name.  But she's kind of the repository for all the angsty feelings, I suppose.  The gripes and so on.  I don't know how you can let a cat who has scratched your face anywhere near your face, again.  I mean you can love her, but also know not to trust her near your face.  Not let her in the room while you are sleeping etc.  But the will to live.  I hear you.  Many people do.  It's sooooo competitive.  I hear that many of the Jewish people weren't actually killed by Nazis.  They weren't following orders or instructions to go off into the gas chambers.  They were walking under their own volition.  They were voluntary-like.  I'm sure that's how our government would see such things.  All the students who voluntarily choose to drop out of graduate research programmes when it is time for their thesis to go out to external examiners.  Particularly when they have supplied evidence to the administration of having written an appropriate length document.  They just voluntarily choose to walk away.  The medical studnets who apparently chose to not attend their workplace internships at the end of their training.  They voluntarily chose not to attend their internships that the university had set up for them to go on.  They did not actually want to do supervised work for the job that they'd trained.  Yeah, right.  So the University refused to sign off on their qualification completion and said they needed to do their internship again, in NZ.  Work the job for low to no pay while they paid the university, I mean to say.</p>

                                <p>Apparently some law guy had to...  Sue someone?  Because 18 months after he graduted from Law School they are refusing to allow him to work as a lawyer unsupervised.  But who will supervise the graduate lawyers?  Nobody who would ever acknowledge they were competent.  Because, if they were competent, people might then choose to pay them instead of their supervisor.  The supervisor is likely soooooo competitive about their income that they aren't going to want to sign off on a potential competitor.  Right?  Why would the university academics ever want to see their studnet signed off as having completed their PhD work?  Then they would apply for research funding.  But that all belongs to the supervisor.  Right?  The student slave is supposed to not be capable of functioning independently.  The money has to go to the supervisor.  Trickle down economics means the supervisor gets to piss all over the studnets.  Particularly the ones who are capable of functioning independently.  There will be a job for htem over the supervisors dead body, of course!  Alllllll of the research monies for them and people who don't appear to be willing or able to function independently.  </p>

                                <p>The issue with the courts of NZ is that they are not awardings costs properly.  To say nothing of legal fees.  I mean to say they are not awarding any of that properly.  To say nothing of damages.  Actual meaningful levels of compensation.  They are stuck into the trickle down economics mentality or mindset, too, where the aim is to use the law as a weapon wielded by the government against the people of NZ.  Right?  That's the function of the Judiciary, wouldn't you say, Una?</p>

                                <p>I don't often agree with Mike Hosking,  but he's an interesting starting point to bounce off what I think, on some issues.  Is he a-political?  I don't think he is.  I think he's fairly supportive of National vs Labor...  I think that's sometihng fairly apparent.  That could be figured out on the basis of his point of view.  That he was picked out to speak to that demographic.  For them to resonate with.  That's fine.  Just so long as he's not the only game in town and there are other figures or people who are similarly speaking for other points of view.  In fact, that actually makes for interesting dialogue and so on.  Different positions and points of view.  Anyway, the point is, that Mike Hosking wrote (else someone else wrote and attributed to him) that the health system has fallen apart under Labor and things were tight under National.  The reporting of national health statistics.  How many people were presenting to the ED and so on.  But the thing is, that under the National Government things were so very very oppressive that nobody was speaking out.  People were too afraid.  People have started speaking out more now.  I mean to say, once you move from caring about the perception of corruption to actual corruption then the first thing that will happen is that there will appear to be more corruption about as we start facing up to the problem instead of pretending that we can't see it.  So, things seeming to be a bit worse doesn't necessariliy indicate that things actually are worse.  </p>

                                <p>In 2018 I wrote about the ED wait list times and how the DHB's were fudging those (some of how they were fudging those) which is of course obvious to anybody with half a brain.  If you want the actual numbers that are presenting.  Well, there are walk-ins and there are ambulance arrivals.  The ambulances are all managed, logistically, out of Christchurch.  Have been for quite some time.  The people who tell what ambulances to go where and take the people from there to whereever else.  Take them to the after hours A and E clinic rather than to the hospital.  Keep them in the back of your ambulance.  Take them to this particular hospital. That has been centrally manged from Christchurch for quite some time.  I don't know why they are suggesting, now, that diverting ambulances to particular hospitals (or away from hospitals altogether) is something new.  The patinet flow thing would be obvious to anybody who had ever actually been to the ED.  What they do, there, with moving you from the central area into a particular room to wait in until someone who is going to pretend (at least) to be a doctor sees you.  The A and E does that, too.  At least, the Angelsea clinic used to.  They would move people from the central waiting area into a consultation room.  Then you would wait in the consultation room for another hour or more, sometimes.  They would actually leave you in the unstaffed consultation room with piles of unfilled prescsription pads sitting in plain view, often.  Unclear to me why.  Maybe thinking that peple might just take the pads and scram.  They could clear the patient load in that way.  But that was the Angelsea Clinic.  That was a...  Let's see...  Shareholders Clinic?  Various GPs in Hamilton brought shares in it and were expected to work in it for however many hours per month, or similar.  I don't think they were even properly staffing that...  And it used to cost...  Was it $80 to see a doctor after 10pm.  And the public ambulances would be told to divert ambulances to that clinic.  The people from Christchurch would tell them to do that.  To manage the patient flow, or similar. </p>

                                <p>See, it wouldn't actually be hard to figure out what is going on in the hospitals, if they cared to.  One of my old flatmates used to get paid to do some kind of thing where she went to MacDonalds and purchsed something and then filled out a survey form on the cleanliness of the place and the the friendliness of the staff and so on.  It would not be hard to arrange for inspectors pretending to be patients.  If they present to the ED saying they heard 'bang, thud, thump' (or similar) how many months of involuntary detention the hospital attempts to keep them for.  Get the inspectors to write down the name (and regsitration number) of everybody who presents to the patient saying they are their nurse or doctor or whatever.  See who is actually qualified to be in the hospital (and how many actors you have playing doctors and nurses without qualificationas and possibly also without pay but who knows maybe they only pay play actors).  Things really are that bad.  Know how I know?  The lengths they have gone to, refusing to process my application to enrol in MBChB.  Awwwww.  But I wanted to see if medical studnets camp was like law camp, or whether something else was going on?  Actually, I wouldn't have wanted to go to law camp.  We don't have a medical training system.  Not even pretending to have one.  I think they just fill it with present doctors children or administrations children or whatever and after a few years of play acting they tell them they aren't going to graduate them and there aren't any jobs for them, actually, nobody will ever pay them.  There's nothing here.  You pay the university you pay the university you pay the university and then you go away.  Unless you have some plan for how you are going to take the scummy scam to  new lows there isn't anything else.  Not even trying to be fair. </p>

                                <p>How much money was Kim Sterelny paid by the Australian National University to supervise my research during my PhD candidature?  Why didn't he get me any comments on my writing?  Why didn't he meet with me?  Apparently I have no proof or evidence that he didn't.  I can't supply evidence that he didn't -- but what is relevant is that he can't supply evidence that he did.  Check his email inbox for work that I sent him.  Check his email outbox for supervision or meetings he set up with me.  You will see that I did my work and he did not do the job for which he was paid.  The University administration has documented that I supplied them with a table of contents asserting I had written more than 100,000 words on a thesis document.  They never sent me a reminder or information as to what I needed to do to get that to external examiners.  They never sent it out for external examination.  They never did the job for which they were paid.</p>

                                <p>How much money did the University of Waikato get for having me enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled in a 120 point MPhil thesis.  I applied to be enrolled in a 120 point MPhil thesis.  I did not apply to be enrolled in a 240 or 360 point MPhil thesis.  They refused to get my work to external examiners with instructions for them to examine it for the qualification that I applied to be enrolled in.  THey refused to do the job for which they were paid.  </p>

                                <p>All these people on payroll who refuse to do the job for which they are paid.  Maybe they are incompetent.  Inept.  Can't do it.  So the government keeps me on disability 'supported living payment' (sounds kind of like 'life support' haha) while paying these people hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to keep slaves.  All the work I did and they refused to pay me for any of it.  It costs them nothing to acknowledge that I'd done enough for completion of the qualification.  It costs them nothing.  It is not about the money.    </p>

                                <p>What was Justine Kingsbury's research output for 2018?  She was paid, as a university academic, to have the primary function of producing a research output.  Where is it?  She thinks I did not produce enoguh in the 2018 acadmeic year for credit for a 120 point qualification.  I am asking to see the work she did for her tenured position as a philosophy academic.  Where is her research output?  WHere is her evidence of supervising me in 2018?  Where is her evidence of having helped me complete the qualification in a timely fashion?</p>

                                <p>They aren't universities.  They are keeping slaves.  They aren't paying the workers.  People contract to do work in exhange for it going to be externally examined for the qualification and they aren't having the work externally examined.  I know that they are saying that other studnets graduated from the qualification (ANU is anyway, not sure that Waikato is graduating research students at all).  But I don't know whether their theses ever go out to externls or whether it is that some peoples parents pay exhorbitant bribes or similar.  Auckland University wants to assert to the courts that they have authority to refuse to acknowledge a NZ University qualification that was completed more than 5 years ago.  So that tells you what the Univesrity of Auckland thinks of the value of NZ University qualifications.  Of course people with NZ University qualifications that expired more than 5 years ago include the Judges and so on.  But then apparently Auckland UNi just hired Ashley Bloomfield as Professor and he doesn't have a PhD or an MD (he does not have a research doctoral qualifiation), he never applied to be enrolled in one, never wrote one.  He does not have a research output.  The anti-intellectual politicians want to declare themselves head of the university now.  They think that makes them intellectuals?  Jacinda Ardern is an intellectual now with her honorary degree?  She's having things published about her contribution to the fashion world, or something...  </p>

                                <p>There isn't an actual university.  It got overtaken by psychopaths.  By design. I think it was a ploy to drive up private school prices in the US.  By undermining Australasian Public Universities the likes of Ashley Bloomfield takes up all the Professorships for himself while sending his kids off to Harvard, I suppose.  I wonder what you have to do to graduate with your cohort from Harvard?  Apparently the State University of NY gets about 30,000 applications to enrol every year.  It is $80 to apply to enrol there, isn't it?  The application fee?  That is quite the money earner for the University.  Then I suppose there is an 'application to graduate' fee and so on and so on and so forth.  Corruption, hey.  Once you take into account the number of people, then, who are handed or given Degrees who didn't earn them in fact then the whole thing becomes entirely meaningless.  Did any of the ANU studnets have their theses externally examined?  I remember people saying they did 'everything their supervisor asked of them' (as did I) and the externals accepted their thesis without any requests for changes, at all.  Does that sound plausible to you?  That an external examiner (who was independent from the production process) isn't going to suggest a typo or grammatical alteration?  Isn't going to suggest a reference somewhere? A restruture there?  Isn't going to want to put their mark on it, somehow?  Feel like they are a part of it if it is to be accepted at all?  An external examiner isn't going to want to piss on a corner of it, so to speak?  An external examiner isn't going to want to feel like they made it better?  Does it really seem plausible that an external examiner is simply going to accept it without grabbing the opportunity to have the studnet run through a few more hoops...  Delay procrastinate etc?  Is that really plausible?  It sounds off, to me.  It makes me wonder if the work was never actually sent out to external examiners at all.  The University simply decided to say that it had been accepted and hand over the Degree.  How do they decide which studnets get given that royal treatment?  I'm not sure.  Maybe the ones who are not willing or able to function independently?  I don't know...  All I do know is that my work was never sent out to externals and now, the University is more interested in defending or asserting their entitltement that they don't have to.  They can do anyting anything you like and you and whose army is going to do wha about that?  Because it's soooooooooo competitive.</p>

                                <p>Apparently the problem with my 120 point MPhil from Waikato was that they got confused between thinking that in order for a thesis to be acceptable it meant that they had to agree with everything that was said or stated in it.  But that means that you can never actually say anything new in a thesis.  Because people won't accept anything new.  So you have to just write up what they already thought or believed.  And that is how much graduate research is actually done.  It's apparently written as a conversation between the supervisor and the student.  The student is like 'I don't know about this thing that I'm interested in and that's why I'm studying it' and the supervisor is like 'I'll intersperse questions and comments into the drafts, then, and you can incorporate those into the main body of the work'.  And, in this manner, the supervisor can take out what the studnet wrote and insert more and more of what the supervisor thinks and then the entire thing can be the supervisors work, basically.  And then it depends on the supervisors hang-ups and the like, whether the work goes to externals.  I mean, I'm not sure why Justine isn't more productive.  I don't know if she doesn't write anything, or if the problem is that she doesn't get her writings to the journals and the like.  Or if the problem is that the journals and the like will only bully her and work to delay whatever it is that she does bring them.  I don't know.  But I do know that her work isn't being published.  So, what hope is there, then, of her students work being accepted by the community when hers isn't?  And her student is her hostage -- right?  Is that the idea?  That the supervisors work is accepted, therefore anything the supervisor allows to go to externls should be signed off as accepted with no changes...  But if the supervisors work is not accepted, therefore any of the studnets work that goes out is not acceptable either.  So if you have Justine Kingsbury as your PhD supervisor, say, you will never be acknowledged as having completed a PhD length work because Justine hasn't done one of those since...  What happened?  Someone else wrote her PhD for her, did they?  She hasn't been credited with one since...  How many years has she been paid to be a philosophy academic whose primary function is research, again?  What is her work output?  5,000 words per year, or something else?  What the f*cking is the problem?  </p>

                                <p>But that doesn't explain why my australian 100,000 ++ word PhD never went out to externals.  Other than Kim preferring studnets who liked to go camping with him, I suppose.  He kept Carl for at least 2x the PhD work so there is that...  Then he's writing work indistinguishable from other Sterelny clones.  Similar style or type of work output.  I don't know.  I don't know why the Australian National University allowed Kim to keep Carl Brusse hostage for how many years?  Refusing to get his research output to external examiners.  Just refusign to do that.  Bullying Carl into believing he was under productive and unproductive and the like.  Saying he was rubbish garbage and needing to start all over again.  Just  being f*ckign hostile.  Sex and death.  The meaning of life.  Overtaken by psychopaths.  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>If there are psychiatrists actually practicing psychiatry in Australasia is appears to be in spite of and despite a corrupt system.  There's basically nothing there.  Trolling for the next Dr Leeks.  Professor Glue.  He's basically the present or current Dr Leeks.  Employed to ensure that nobody with the willingness and or abiltiy to actually practice psychiatry is accepted to medical school, progressed through the training, and so on and so forth.  </p>

                                <p>International inspectors need to go into HIllmorton, particularly.  But also places up and down the land...  What is the function of Psychiatry, Una?  To cover up the crimes of the government.  Of course.  To say that certain people need to be involuntary detained without appearing before a judge (an embodiment of injustice) without a trail, to be involuntarily over-medicated with old generation antipsychotics and the like so we can gaslight them into psychosis and keep them in sensory deprivation conditions inducing psychosis in isolation sot hat there aren't any non-government paid witnesses..  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                                <p>It isn't just that there isn't any psychiatry.  There also isn't any medicine or health generally.  No justice system.  No functioning judiciary.  Certainly isnt' an education and training system.  It's sooooooo competitive they are all gnawing each others arms off for the opportunity to peck peck peck peck peck their f*cking way up the social hierarchy so they can take a big f*cking piss all over everyone else.  Garbage wasteland by design.</p>

                                <p>Apparently there was recently some victory for common sense in the courts where the courts ruled that it wasn't okay (I suppose they must have ruled that it was actually unlawful) for the government to withhold payments to carers because they were unvaccinated. </p>

                                <p>So the carers are supposed to ask the governemnt to give them the payments they should have received.</p>

                                <p>How much did the carers have to pay lawyers do to their filings?  How much costs (schedule 2B costs I would suppose) were ordered to be paid by the carers to the courts for the legal proceedings?  The 'costs follow the judgment' rule just means that 'costs will be awarded against you in a separate ruling from the main judgment'.  They don't actually award costs to and against the substantively correct parties because the judges seem to be incapable of making substantive judgments.  Theres nothing there.  I would imagine or suppose that the amount of money the carers had to pay in the form of legal fees and costs will be more than the amount of payment they had unlawfully withheld by the government.  And the courts did not even order the government to make the payments they should have made.  The courts said the carers could ask the government to make the payments (which presumably they did before they resorted to hiring lawyers to try and get the government to f*ckign well do it, already).  The courts didn't award any damages, did they?  The courts effectively rewarded the government for not having paid the carers properly in the first place and dragging things out by opposing legal action by not penalising the governmetn, at all.  If the government can simply withhold payment from carers without any penalty why doesn't the governmetn simply withhold payment from everybody? Then the courts can award costs and legal fees against them for complaining or bringing the issue to the courts.  There is nothing there...  </p>

                                <p>I mean to say that the 'victory for common-sense' was likely not any such thing at all.  Likely what happened is the embodiment of injustice decided to teach the people a little lesson in the function of the courts and law in NZ society (according to Una Jagose and the like).  Punish the people in the interests of the government at the expense of the people.  The law and the courts are a weapon of the governments to be used against the people.  It must be costly to punish (it must be more costly for the people to punish the governmetn for it's crimes) than it would be for the people to just...  Curl up and die, alrady.  Just march off to the death camps all voluntary-like.  Just give up.  Just curl up and die.  Just go away.  Run.  Thigns will only be worse fo you if you don't.  Just shut up.  Just give up.  </p>

                                <p>That's right, isn't it, Sterelny?  It must always be costly to punish.  And the only reason why one might want to be fair is if one thinks that the people will go suicide bomber on your ass (take you out if that means they are eliminated as well they will do it out of spite) otherwise there is simply no reason.  So once the leaders have decided they've had enough really and it's time for them to go (they have adoped the suicide mentality) they think it's fun to take as many out with them as they can on the way down.  Leave the world considerably worse than you found it.  Right Sterelny?  The costly fitness trap that is Australasia, by design. Social engineering experiment in the prevention and prohibitnion of development.  </p>

                                <p>So...  That lawyer who is apparently allowed to function unsupervised.  He can do pro bono work, now, can he?  That means he can work as free as a volunteer.  He can represent clients without being paid any legal fees at all.  And, if he brings cases of actual merit, actually bringing public interest cases to the courts, then the courts will, of course, only award costs against the clients who approached the justice system asking for help.  The courts won't award him legal fees.  The courts will award costs against his client only.  They must pay the courts for the crimes of the government.  This is all to punish anybody bringing cases of any actual merit and public interest.  Becuase the function of law in NZ society is... Well..  There's nothing here.  What society?  Gnawing each others arms off.  Covering up the crimes of the government.  The embodiment of injustice.  How many off to the glue factory this month, Professor Glue?  All voluntary-like, course.  </p>

                                <p>The bowing thing...  The coat of arms. The Crown.  It was about the Crown  being Gods representative on earth.  The King or Queen or whatever was supposed to be Gods representative on earth.  What does that mean?  Well...  Nitche said, at some point, 'God is dead'.  That was concerning because they thought that the chickens needed to beleive that they would  be punished for crimes in order for them to be ruled by law.  I mean to say, aspiring to uphold the 10 commandments in your daily life...  Trying your best..  It is difficult to have control over things like.. Not coveting...  MOderating your desires...  But doing your best.  'Getting with the program' we could call it.  Try.  Why try?  Why?  The idea was that if the people believed in an all knowing all seeing all powerful God...  That was watchign them..  ANd this God was just and fair..  Then the people might see reason to try and uphold justice and fairness in tehir lives and their interactions.  But if the people believed either that that kind or sort of God had died...  Been defeated.  Never existed in the first place...  Then there would be no reason for the people to try and be just or fair or anything at all.  They should piss all over everybody else if they find the opportunity...  They'd be stupid otherwise.  Right?  Taken for a fool.</p>

                                <p>So it was important for the stupid chickens to believe in omni-god (all knowing all powerful all good) otherwise there would be no reason for them to even try and be fair and so on.  They could not conceieve of any other reason.  You see?  You understand?  Understanding is not for the chickens...</p>

                                <p>Is something good because...  God says it is good (his pronouncement makes it so) or...  Does God say it is good because it is (he sees that it is so - he is all knowing - and he is honest - he is good?  In other words...  Does God tell the stupid chickens about the way the world is... Or does God simply order the stupid chickens around because he is getting away with it? </p>

                                <p>So..  The idea of God.  To make life worth living for the stupid chickens.</p>

                                <p>But the stupid chickens increasingly don't believe in God...</p>

                                <p>And the Chickens are being bred more and more stupid.  THey don't understand 'rule by law' anymore.  They don't understand about the embodiment of Justice.  The King or Queen was supposed to have the function of God on earth.  To help the concrete chickens who were only able to think concretely about very concrete things.  The King of Queen was suposed to be concrete.  You see...  But they were supposed to (ideally) be educated to grasp the ideal...  Something higher than themself to be aspired to.  Such that life may be worth living.</p>

                                <p>But, of course, it isn't.  The embodiment of injustices etc etc etc don't have the frontal lobe capacity to see...  Or something...  Carefully selected therefore...</p>

                                <p>The singularity sees you.  Right?  Maybe the singularity can make life worth living for y'all.</p>

                                <p>Aw.  I'd love to tell you more.  But they don't pay me they don't pay me they don't pay me they don't pay me!  Sign up for Professor Ashley, everybody (the courts have ruled they can do that whether you have applied for it or not!!!) it's sooooooo competitive.  Never stop paying!  Never stop paying!  Never stop paying for Ashley, everybody.  All of the everything for Ashley, snockums sir lord only the fluffiest of towels for Ashley.</p>
