                             <p>`Massive mental illness like the twisties'...</p>

                             <p>There are higher level skills and lower level skills.  For example...  Suppose there are skills A, B, and C.  C is elite level competition.  The performance of C is what elite level athletes are assessed on.  In training...  Should the athletes train A or B or C?  Or what ratio of them all?  </p>

                             <p>There are some skills (maybe A) such that performance on them, or training on them, is indicative of performance of C.  But where training C alone will only undermine or stall progress.</p>

                             <p>My understanding was that tumbling (both forwards and backwards tumbling) is a more basic level skill than twisting.  I mean to say, tumbling is trained extensively.  Controlled tumbling.  So that athletes can initiate a tumble and pull out of the tumble in time to stick the landing...  That is extensively trained.</p>

                             <p>Twisting is then a higher level skill superimposed on top of tumbling.  But it is an advanced level skill that needs to be kept limited in it's practice time.  If you do too much tumbling - with a twist - then you get the 'twisties' which means you cannot control your tumble (the more basic skill) to pull out and stick the landing.  So you need to tumble tumble tumble tumble tumble.  And then tumble with a twist.  And then tumble tumble tumble tumble tumble.</p>

                             <p>Like how your elite level freestylers need to kick kick kick kick kick kick kick.  Too much sprinting freestyle leads to an infeffectual kick that will lose them the race.  Kick kick kick kick kick.  Not too much sprinting.  Or they get the 'sprinties' or whatever.</p>

                             <p>Like what happens if you do too many 1 rep maxes with your olympic weightlifters.  They lose the neuromuscular coordination and they stall.</p>

                             <p>I don't see how it is a mental illness.  So much as it is a reality of the limits of high level performance.  How much the training and bread and butter and everyday needs to really get back to and focus in on the basics.  </p>

                             <p>Can't be sprinting every day.  Can't be practicing tumbles with twists everyday.  Can't be expected to peak every day.  Need time to get back to the basics.  Fundamentals.  Foundations.  Keep it simple, stupid, and all that.</p>
