 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>Alright, so here's the story.  I am waiting on two things: </p> 

                                <p>(1)  The Australian National University.  They are locating my student records and saying something about why I left the ANU without recieving credit for a PhD. 
                                </p> 

                                <p>(2)  The social security tribunal of New Zealand.  The courts have set more than $20,000 security for costs otherwise my proceedings are, they say, forced to have been abandoned.  Forced to be aborted, if you will.  The registrar's say that my cases are not public interest cases and everything is all very particular or personal against me.
                                </p>


                            <p>
                            The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications.  They define a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  
                            <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a> Whereas the High Court Judge thought that the University of Waikato was entitled to refuse to get my work to external examiners because I submitted it 'too early'.  Waikato said I needed to work for 12 months (at least) before submitting a 120 point thesis for up to 3 months of external examination.  Apparently that's normal practice for all the students -- but it's not a matter of public interest, it's all very personal against me.
                            </p>

                            <p>Here is how much the Inland Revenue says I owe the New Zealand Government for my 'Education' and 'Training' that are no longer acknowledged because New Zealand qualifications expire 5 years post-graduation (well, not the Judges law degrees, apparently, but my qualifications have expired): 
  
                            <a href="judicial-review/ird-shot.pdf" target="_self"> $104,663.</a>

                            They have not provided a break-down of what courses they recorded me as having been enrolled in, in what year.  I have transcripts for some years that I will upload.  They acknowledge that I have completed BA(hons) and an MA (I can't tell whether they invoiced 1 year or 2 years or more of fees total for the MA - it looks to me from my transcript that they may have double-billed).  They refuse to acknowledge that I have completed anything since then.  They keep invoicing my student loan -- for courses that I never applied to be enrolled in (changing enrolment dates for more billings for them which make me look like I'm slow).  They take my research work, particularly, and give it to third parties without crediting me (or paying me).   
                            </p>

                            <p> We don't have a health system.  We don't have an education and training system.  There's nothing here.  It's a detention camp is all.  There's nothing here.  The courts don't / won't / can't function.  There's nothing here.  Or there's two worlds or two realms, or something, and I'm shut out.  Not Miss popular.  No PhD for me.  That's clearly what it's about.  Honorary because we like you else nothing at all.
                            </p>

                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  They aren't progressing the filings. They are refusing to supply applications, refusing to process applications on their academic merits.  Apparently it isn't a matter of public interest how they pick and choose people to pass themsleves off as 'doctors' in our hospitals.
                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  Demanding me to pay more and more and more money to the courts else they force all my cases aborted, or abandoned.  
                                </p> 

                            <p>
                            It seems to me that the Australian Constition explicitly states that New Zealand is regarded, by them, to be a State of the Federation of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  Australia refuses to honor it's own Constitution.  New Zealand seems to function as a detention camp of Australia only.  That is how the NZ Government chooses to keep the people of New Zealand.
                            </p>

                            <p>Here are  <a href="judicial-review/sup-court-waikato.pdf" target="_self"> My Filings </a>to the Supreme Court regarding the University of Waikato    
                            </p>

                            <p>The Social Security Appeal Authority  <a href="judicial-review/ssaa.pdf" target="_self"> Intention to schedule a phone call sometime after July 4. </a></p>

                            <p>So the state of the scam is 1/3rd of the nurses aren't graduated because they refuse to sign off that they have completed their internship.  They are 'working' 40 hour weeks while paying the University for their student fees, not being paid by the hospital.  They get them to re-enrol and re-enrol and re-enrol and keep paying keep paying never stop paying the University.  That is how we 'staff' the hospital.  With unpaid slaves.  Who pay the University.  How long can they get away with that?  I guess at some point someone will blow up the hospital.  That seems to be what they are going for, here.  Quite the experiment.  Quite the primate research study.  They say they won't give them their qualifications -- because then they would choose to leave for overseas (Australia, say) where they would actually be paid to work.  They don't want them leaving, and they don't want to pay them, so they decide they are entitled to keep them, slaving, as slaves.  If they don't like it, well, f*ck off and die, then.  Can always replace you with a new cohort of students.  It's sooooooooo competitive.  The students will do anything anything anything for their degree.  And it's all very normal completely normal and standard and it just happens to everyone like this.  It's just the way that it is.  because of COvid.  You know...
                            </p>

                            <p>Shortland Street teaches people how to act, in the Hospitals.  That's why we have the Bloomfield show.  Public Health Education.  It isn't like Pharmac purchases first world medications, anyway.  People airlift to Sydney.  There's nothing in this little detention camp.  It's not even trying to develop.  It's just a stupid scam.  They pay slavers to keep slaves.  They don't pay the workers.  There's spin doctors and marketers and managers and administrators and slavers, generally.  And then there's just this scam.  Hopefully they will die before graduation (else we simply won't graduate them) and if they push it..  Well, they must  be a violent criminal.  Right?  I mean, they must  be.  They don't count.  We refuse to count them.  Apparently our unemployment rate is so low.  So low.  HOw many people are there, do you think?  Count the other way.  HOw many full time jobs are there?  Enough for 1 in every...  10 people?  People don't count -- because you are invoicing them as students right.  So they arent' unemployed.  Else they are disabled.  That's 25 per cent who don't count as unemployed.  Too old.  Too young.  Criminals.  
                            </p>

                            <p>How long can it possibly take to complete 1 year of research?  I gu gu gu gu gu gu gu guess you'll just be forced to re re re re re re repeat the year.  That's a gu gu gu gu gu gu gud plan for you.  I didn't mind that you had a stutter.  I gave you time to speak.  But it's not a stutter of motor output it's a stutter of mental processing.  Whose job is it to explain to me that the game everyone is playing is the race your way to PhD by the time you are 25 game? I said I wanted to learn more.  I wanted to do a 5 year programme in the US because I wanted 2 more years of courses before writing my PhD.  So I would be able to draw things together and actually have something to say.  Whose job is it to say that you aren't supposed to have anything to say.  You are supposed to get your supervisor to write it for you.  Else you take your undergraduate student's work and you kludge that together into a thesis.  Put them to work in your classes and get them writing about Descartes, or whatever, then write up your version once you've read the work of the entire class.  Get your ideas from there.  If they are partiuclarly good then you'll likely want to fail them out of the University.  At the every least, make them repeat a year.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I did not know that many people consider the game to be to race your way to doctor (of any variety) by the time you are 25 years old.  18 from School, 21 from undergrad, 22 for Honors, 25 brings us to the end of a 3 year PhD.  Then there's 1 year of sucking up -- right?  After being told you have to work for 3 years before submitting for examination then there's 3 months examination, 6 months re-enrolment (the inevitable outcome of what they like to call 'first examination'), another 3 months examination.  And then..  Probably up to 10 weeks of crying screaming tortuous tantrums while the University administration and the supervisor bring out the sniper rifles...  And maybe (if you are popular enough and you sucked enough of the right d*cks) then you'll get your PhD.  Or your MBChB.  After working for..  Is it a 1 year internship in the hospitals (yeah, right).  While you pay fees to the University, of course.  Never stop.  Never stop.  Never stop within invoicing your workers to do the work.  Never stop keeping the slaves.  Quite the racket.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            And every case is another thesis.  Another thesis that I write for the courts, now.  How much work do you think goes into me filing for the High Court and Court of Appeal for each and every one of my cases.  For the Supreme Court.  The filing and re-filing and re-filing.  Case management conference after case management conference after case management conference.  How many hours of my life do you think that takes.  And the courts send me invoices that I am to pay court costs, I am to pay court costs, I am to pay court costs.  Gee, the state of our Courts looks really rather a lot like the state of our tertiary education looks really rather a lot like the state of our hospitals. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Well, then, die, Ms Roe.  You have outlived your usefulness to us.  You have been forced to be aborted.  That's what voluntary means.  Thanks for playing!
                            </p>

                            <p>Andrew Little said something about how it isn't about vaccination rates...  It is about knowing that everyone who wanted a vaccine could have one (and had time for that to take effect) before the borders opened.  I agree that sounds like a better goal.  We would want to say that.  Did that happen?  I am not sure that it did.  Some people were given vaccine that was diluted contrary to manufacturers instructions.  Other people were given vaccine that had expired.  Some people did not take up the offer of vaccine -- because they were skeptical of the competency and / or integrity of the medical or health system in New Zealand.  Because of past problems (e.g., administering the wrong thing, administering the wrong dose of the thing, administering things past expiry).  People don't feel safe presenting for health things when they are involuntarily detained in conditions that may amount to torture.  Then there's the issue of trying to force or mandate compliance with sanctions like loss of employment for teachers and the like.  THe government doesn't need yet another reason to refuse to pay the teachers and the like.  They just don't.  So many small businesses were put out of business by way of forced closures.  How is the stock market supposed to grow when people can't do business?  Can't grow business?  Can't get government contracts or government...  Sanction... In order to be allowed to function.  It's not rocket science.  But, sure.  First step, getting the aim or the goal or the target right.  Second step, let's get a bit clearer on 'perverse incentives' vs the 'wicked problem of evil'.  Is it that we are bad at being good, or is it that we are good at being bad?  What do we value?  Where does all the money go?
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Alright... Here is a concern.  You can grow sperm and egg unions (pre-embryos, embryos, whatever you want to call them) in a dish, or a uterus you found somewhere (some donor) or whatever.  Until they are...  HOwever old they are.  Then you need to implant them in a women's uterus (in a woman).  Let's call that 'IVF treatment'.   So...  Let's say you are a mad scientist who wants to know what all the human genes do.  And you have this idea that how you find out what a gene does is you knock it out.  Zap.  And then you see what deficits or whatever the growing embryo or foetus or neonate or infant or 10 year old or 20 year old or whatever...  What it is that they can't do.  So...  You want to implant them...  And fetch them later.  How do you play 'fetch', then? Well...  You can take it from the 'mother' later...  YOu can induce premature delivery.  If you want to be all clinical and not at all touchy feely you can schedule cesarians where surgeons remove the 'tumor' that is the growing thing... Maybe it has a beating heart...  Maybe there is a market for beating hearts of around that stage of development.  Maybe you can grow the beating heart in a lab..  Do experiments on it..  Implant it later..  These are the kinds of sorts of things...  And in a developed nation you hope that ethics and science and statistics and humanities and all the fields are at similar stages of development and there is a kind or a sort of quality control.  ANd in NZ the trouble is you hear really rather a lot about why they are justified in ethics dump kinds of studies.  And then it turns out htey plant o make up their data, anyway (clean their data) and do dodgey data colection and then dodgey stats and then dodgey science where the aims or whatever..  Teh scientific justification for the experiment is basically very weak to think to non-existent.  And then you add to that entire situation ethics dump.  And you end up with a bunch of people basically torturing innocent children for fun.  Because, you know, it's costly to sto pthem.  Apparently.  ANd that is kind of the stage of development.  Where New Zealand is at.  Direct flights to the Ivy League also Texas.  Because peole will pay big money for various things...  To be sure...  And you see how much people will sell ut the health of people..  Rather than sak honest people genuinely, for help.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Quote for the day:  'we give it the good old college 'try' and see if it sinks it's teeth into us (to divert us from the main quest of being dr of whatever is highest ranked in the hierarchy of being before we turn 25).  Sure.  Sounds like a great system.  Then it's time to die.  Your kids can play again.  Thanks for playing.  Who wins?
                            </p>

                            <p>So...  Mixing it up a little from 'better call saul' 'is New Zealand Society better off for having Kelly Alexandra Roe be part of it?' and the answer, from the New Zealand Governmetn is a resounding:  'No!'  I mean, look how much money she owes them.  She owes them for her 'education'.  She owes them for what the law courts had to say about her 'education'.  She owes them for her 'essential costs' including accommodation. All of these recorded in teh form of a negative debt against her.  To the NZ government.  She has no loans from banks or loan sharks or whatever.  The New Zealand governmetn thought it was entitled to be the loan shark.  Her mother died.  Maybe because there is no medical care or treatment in New ZEaland.  Her sister was given (by her mother) access to bank accounts and term deposits.  Some of which was distributed early.  Public trust did not ask for the money to be repaid.  WE are talking sums in the tens of thousands.  We are not talking enough sums to pay the costs the courts are demanding are paid before she has access to justice.  WE are not talkng enough to pay back the amount the government recorded against her name for her 'essential costs' involve din the fact that she f*cking well exists.  Jesus F*cking christ.  Why would she help you.  You got that f*cking right.  She hopes the f*cking terrorist bombers end you f*cking all. You are f*cking welcome.  You win!!!! The great game of annihiliate us soon as you can!!!!  That's the will of the people!!! Well f*cking done!!! Yay you!!!
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I mean, the brilliant thing of all is looking at the law firms that the Universities chose to appose me.  Little old me.  Myself.  Standing up for myself with no other support.  They choose to hire primary and secondary council from major Auckland Law firms.  They chose to hire Queens Council.  They chose to  hire...  What was Mr Sims?  PhD in Law from Oxford?  2 Year Masters??  Against lil old me.  Lil old me who is only allowed to accumulate negative value (clearly because there is something wrong with my math).  yeah.. Sure..  That' sthe problem here...  What's that, Sterelny?  'Not worth marrying'.  Right.  Sure.  I guess you would know.
                            </p>
