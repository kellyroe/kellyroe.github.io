                            <p>
                                <a href="https://kellyroe.github.io/writing/realmecv.pdf">Chronological CV</a>
                                There is a link to my CV that I have presently under consideration for various things.
                             </p>

                             <p>I will try not to do  anything to break the links while I update contents.  I am in the process of file re-formatting and reorganising my work. </p>

                             <p>Have I done enough for a PhD?  How many years is it supposed to take, again?  Before they, you know, they pay you.  We are supposed to believe that Jacinda Ardern gets honorary qualifications and honorary fellowships becuase she's going to write a book one day (after completing a 3 year undergraduate degree from Waikato) whereas I haven't done enough?  We are supposed to believe that Ashley Bloomfield gets appointed to Professor of Public Health when he never applied to do a M.D or PhD, never did the work for one.  He doesn't have any research output.  What Universities?  There doesn't seem to be anything there.</p>

                             <p>
                              https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/504035/student-hunger-bad-teachers-revealed-in-latest-pisa-tests-showing-dip-in-nz-teens-scores  New Zealand students don't care about studying or working hard.  Because they don't pay you, they don't pay you, they won't pay you, they won't pay you.  They won't let you sit the exams, but even if you did they wouldn't grade them properly.  They won't graduate people who have done the work.  They won't even process applications to enrol.  There's  nothing there ffs.  They aren't even trying to be fair, at all.   
                             </p>

                             <p>Work hard to get into `University' everybody.  Justice Toogood (pulled out of retirement for the occasion  because that's the proper process for appointing judges) ruled that he couldn't see anything wrong with the `Univesrity' of Waikato recording that I was enrolled in a MPhil Programme in 2019 when *I never applied to be enrolled with the `University' of Waikato in 2019.  I mean to say that you don't even need to apply to be enrolled in `University' in order for the `University' to arrange for debt to be recorded against your name with the IRD.  Didn't you know?  WOrk hard to go to `University' everybody!  Why not record that everybody is re re re re re enrolled with the `University'.  That way you will never need to pay anybody at all!  THey can just stay in the student slums indefinately handing over more and more and more work for the people already on payroll to reattribute to other people already on payroll.</p>

                             <p>It's a f*cking farce of a f*ckign joke of a f*cking scummy scam.  There's nothing there.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                             <p>We don't have teachers and nurses and doctors etc  becuase we won't pay them.  Nobody is allowed to work those jobs.  They won't pay anybody to do themm.  No shortage of unpaid slaves to pass themselves off, as.  If it's really sooooo competitive to do medicine then why do they need to spend so much money exporting Shortland Street to the world to teach the migrant slaves how to comport themselves in NZ hospitals.  Come to NZ, everybody!  Play school.  Do all of the work for none of the wages.  Don't forget to re re re re re re apply for visa re re re re processing, everybody.  We won't pay the workers.  There's no workers, here.  Nobody has any qualifications.  There's nothing here.  ALl of the jobs for Ashley, therefore!  I'm soooo glad I'm a gamma baby, I don't have to get paid half as much as Ashley.  Ffs.  The F*cking psychopaths.  Right, Sterelny?  You managed to take out your f*cking pen and arrange for a meeting with the studnet you are supposed to be supervising, yet?  How many words per year was that?  For how many years?  You f*cking psychopath.  Is it f*cking well dead yet?  There's nothing there.  Go to University (`University') to eat your lunch with Sterelny, everybody.  What a f*cking farce of a f*cking hoax of a f*cking joke.  Mate.  F*cking hell.  There's nothing there.</p>

                             <p>Oh it's sooooo competitive, to get into Medical School, in New Zealand.  It's really competitive entry on the basis of GPA (not even a little bit).  They will not process the applications.  There's nothing there.  Nobody home.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  Dr Leeks was the only game in town.  Everybody else's application was thrown away.  Everything it is that we value.  There's nothing there.  What health system?  It's sooooo competitive!  How many people (sorry, `people') can we kill today?  </p>
