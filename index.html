 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/opinion/131711380/josie-pagani--yes-minister-health-is-in-crisis  Well, now, what could explain them thinking they are doing a great job of things?  I guess you need to think about what their aim, purpose, point, or goal is.  If the aim was to kill rural Maaori with cigarettes, for example, then could they be doing a better job of it?  At some point in history didn't they give the natives small-pox infected blankets in an attempt to eliminiate them (because it's soooooo competitive)?  Why would we think that our health system wasn't similarly competitive?  Trying to kill off everybody else's kid.  Or at least sicken them, weaken them a bit.  Kill off everybody else.  Disable them.  Incapacitate them.  It being sooooooo competitive, and all.  The trouble with the ideal of social services is that it requires people to actually be pro-social.  But what evidence is there of that, then?  What evidence is there that the leaders are even trying to be fair, at all?  </p>

                                <p>Jacinda wants to eliminate violent extremism?  Really?  I thought her whole strategy was to encourage it since that is what makes her appear to be at her best.  Didn't she say that she was in virginia when the twin towers were bombed and she became motivated and inspired by how the people who were so very divided over politics before all game together in their grief and disbelief and mourning.  They turned to the political leaders for words of comfort.  Instead of having vitriole against the leaders the vitriole was directed towards the person who was named to be 'terrorist'.  And Jacinda wanted in on that action.  So, then, there needs to be 'terrorists' or 'terrorist-like activity' so that she can comfort the people.  Right?  So they can be comforted by her.  So the likes of Brian Tamaki need to be locked up in Mt Eden so that nobody can vote for him because he's clearly a terrorist threat to the New Zealand Government...  Uh..  Yeah...</p>

                                <p>'The Christchurch Call' is a social experiment in how under conditions of urgency urgency it's an emergency the government takes more and more and more powers for itself to not do proper process to not do proper consultation.  To pass laws in the stealth of the night.  I don't really understand the role that Jacinda played (or if she was merely reading the teleprompts) telling the graduates of Harvard that they wouldn't be prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus in NZ (so destination for all their knock-out gene studies).  Nobody was prosecuted when abortion was a criminal offense.  But more in particular, that was her chosen way of informing the people of NZ that the abortion laws had been changed by stealth without any public consultation on the issue whatsoever.  Not even trying to be a democratic country following proper process at all.  Not even trying to be.</p>

                                <p>What is the aim of Tertiary Education, in New Zealand?  Is it to ensure that the people currently on payroll never need to retire from their positions?  In other words, to ensure that 'education' is about the prevention and prohibition of education and training and skills development so as to ensure the people currently on payroll are, and will remain to be, the only game in town?  That seems to be the aspirational goal or ideal of it.  To not educate or train or develop any kind of a work-force, at all.  Why would we graduate them -- then we would have to pay them?  Why would we pay them when we can collect their slave-work for free?</p>

                                <p>How much research output do the researchers on Univesrity payroll do every year?  Is it indistinguishable from the output of a computer programme?  Is it indistinguishable from them copying and pasting together the output of their first year class or the output of their graduate research students whose work they stole before they bullied them into fleeing the 'University' with no credit for the work they have done?</p>

                                <p>New Zealand says there is no point graduating students from our 'Universities' becuase we aren't going to pay them to do the work that they have trained for.  Teachers.  Nurses.  Doctors.  All the things, really.  We will cry cry cry cry cry cry cry about how there aren't any and refuse to acknowledge that the problem is that we refuse to pay them.  The people presently on payroll will have to die before there will be a job for anybody else, apparently.  They are the only game in town.  Don't acknowledge anybody else's qualifications.</p>

                                <p>How many psychiatrists did Dr Leeks train to do the kinds or sorts of things that he was up to?  How many applications to Medicine did he throw away to ensure he would remain the only game in town?  How many studnets did he refuse to sign off on?  Just keep working the internships.  Just one more internships.  Just keep handing over more and more and more research 'work' to  your supervisor.  We still aren't done assessing whether you have the capacity to do the job.  We only know that the people presently on payroll are the only game in town and there will be a job for you over their dead bodies, apparently.  Have to bring people in from overseas because there aren't any skilled and trained New Zealanders.  None acknowledged as such that aren't indisginguishable from a computer programme therefore why pay them when you can get a computer programme to do their work for no pay?</p>

                                <p>'There could be no evidence admitted that would attest to corruption within the New Zealand Government'.  That's a good output for the courts.  They can refuse to accept evidence, refuse to accept filings. It's at the Judges's discretion to order re-filing of the re-filing of the re-filing of the re-filings, apparently or allegedly.  And the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Courts say that it is contrary to the independence of the Judiciary for them to remind the Judiciary on expectations for timely judgment delivery.  That is or means to say, remind them that 5 months post-hearing a Judgement is awaited...  Still..  Everything is held up by the courts.  Apparently they are off sick and they are off on holiday.  Becuase they are the only game in town for their payroll and that, presumably, is precisely why they are paid.  Chris Whelan hasn't processed a single application of wrongdoing against any of the 'Universities' of NZ since he was appointed to CE of the NZVCC back in about 2014.  The Education and Training Act says the position is about upholding the quality and integrity of NZ Universities.  Only, there isn't any quality and integrity to NZ Universities, at all, by the seems of it.  They (regularly, reliably, systemically and systematically) say that 'personal problems' occur such that they refuse to process enrolment, completions etc.  They won't get students work out for external examination and they choose to employ people with little to no research output.  They aren't even trying to be fair at all.  The problem, then, is that the likes of Justice Toogood need to be pulled out of retirement and re-appointed as Judge presumably because there isn't anybody else who will be acknowledged willing or able to do that job until he's dead.  Over his dead body.  Re-appointing a retired Judge is not a proper process for appointing a Judge.  They are not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                                <p>New Zealand does not have a functioning health,  education and training, judiciary, at all.  It is written into the Australian Constitution that NZ is a state of the Federation of Australia.  There is a process involved in how they are to go about changing their constitution.  That involves a vote.  They don't get to say that various of NZ leaders simply failed to turn up to various meetings therefore NZ is no longer a State of Australia by consent.  They never gave the people voting papers and asked them if they wanted to be citizens of Australia or not.  What does it mean to be a citizen of Australia?  Australaian wages for government work.  Access to Australian education and training programmes.  Government employment.  They aren't even trying to be fair.  NZ says they will not sign off on NZ qualifications because qualified people will flee from NZ to Australia for wages since they won't pay them to do skilled work in NZ.  They are trafficking slaves around is all they are doing.  They are not even trying to be fair.</p>

                                <p>Who wins?  Foreign countries, I guess.  Who ensure that Australasia needs to keep turning to them for skilled anything since Australasia failed to develop education and training programmes etc.  The only leaders International Community will acknowledge or accept for this region are ones who ensure the lack of education and training systems, judiciary, health system etc etc.  There doesn't appear to actually be anything here, at all.  Not even trying to be fair.  Refusign to process filings.  Refusing to process applications to enrol.  Refusing to process qualification completions.  Refusing to employ skilled workers.  Refusing to pay the workers.  Insisting on re-appointing 'Judges' from retirement to see nothing wrong.  Insisting on employing Chris Whelan who cannot / won't do the job for which he is paid.  There is nothing here, at all.</p>

                                <p>And of course the jobs (insfoar as there are any) go to the people they were always going to go to.  The dependents.  Those kept dependent.  Those not willing or able to function or work independently.  That's the aim or the goal or the purpose or the point of the education and training system.  Right?  To output indistinguishable units so they can console themselves that it's entirely arbitrary who is picked for payroll and who is picked to slave since they are all much of a much of a much of a samey sameness.  It wasn't like Dr Leeks  or Dr Green (Pathology, from the Cartwright Inquiry) was doing anything any differently from what anybody and everybody else who was acknowledged as Pathologist or Psychiatrist would be doing.  Right?  The only game in town.  Let's have yet another courtcase where the victims can cry cry cry cry cry about how impactful the perpetrators were.  How they will never ever be forgotten.  If you can't be loved may as well be hated, right?  Let's sing a monument to these monumental figures and create a real motivation and incentivisation for people to become Medical Doctors in these lands.  The courts can give teeth to how bringing these issues before the courts will result in the victims paying the victims paying the victims paying the victims paying the victims paying to sing sing sing about just how monumental these figures were.  How these only game in town figures ruined so very very very very very many lives.  In a land that aspires to be sooooooooooo competitive.  All the money from the victims so they can pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the courts.  What judiciary?  There is nothing here.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  THey aren't processing applciations to Medicine.  They aren't processing completions from training.  They are intentionally not doing these things so that they can dedeploy the likes of Dr Leeks around in order specifically to see how many lives can be declared 'incapacitated' and 'disabled' and the like.  How many lives they can claim to have ruined.</p>

                                <p>War on the people.  Think how how the politicians and various leaders think of the function of role of education.  Knowledge is power, apparently.  Why would those in power voluntarily choose to share power?  Why would they want to pursue equality or fairness?  Psychopaths.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>I think the messaging has been, for quite some time, that NZ aspires to be the garbage slave-land of the world.  It wants to seek out (sends the likes of Chris Whelan blackbirding) for people who have no options or no alternatives or who can be indoctrinated into believing that that is true.  Then they can pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for visa and visa and visa and visa and pay and pay and pay and pay for re-enrolment and re-enrolment and re-enrolment and re-enrolment.  Until it's time to take all their work for no credit and no pay and deport them.  Make them go away.  Quite the way to run an economy of slave 'workers', hey.  Not trying to have any kind of honesty or integrity at all -- right Chris Whelan?  The Judge says that it would be unlawful for you to perform your statutory function.  Riiiiight.  In upside down and back to front land.</p>

                                <p>Why do the Universities choose to hire senior partners of major firms to defend them in court?  That is the kind of thing that guilty people do.  Or maybe I'm a real prodigy with my filings that they didn't feel able to simply ignore my filings (it was civil proceedings and they needn't have hired legal counsel at all if they thought I was being vexatious).  But it turns out they could simply have relied upon the corruption of judges else the fact that NZ does not have a functioning judiciary, at all.  The judges refuse to accept evidence that I supplied.  They judges refuse to acknowledge half the laws (the ones conferring duties or obligations on the Universities).  The judges insist upon recasting or conceptualising or framing the problem that I brought before the courts as something other than the 'ultra vires' claim that I actually brought  before the courts.  They insistently refuse to distinguish between the outcome of a judgement (and whether I personally do or do not like it becuase it's all very very very very very personal and particular against me and not a matter of public interest at all, apparently) and the process by which the judgment is made.  The problem in NZ is that either there is not procedure for fair process else the procedure that there is is not followed.  For example, they will not allow blind grading of academic work on the basis of it's academic merits.  Because they want the children of the administration (for example) to be given the qualifications or the paycheques or whatever.  They aren't even trying to be fair at all.  So much work goes into ensuring that the likes of Dr Leeks is the only game in town.  Nobody else gets to have their application considered.  They throw the applications away before they consider them on their academic merits.  They intentionally enrol 18 year olds (saying they have discretion therefore are allowed) and say that they aren't so very much worse than any other applicant.  But they only say that  because they threw away the applications from any applicant that looked  better on paper.  They throw away applications from domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years (who are eligible to be enrolled in the programme they have applied to) to expediate enrolment of 18 year olds who will better  be trained to be the next Dr Leeks and Dr Green and so on.  They aren't even trying to be fair.  It isn't a tertiary education institution at all.  It's yet another government institution of abuse is what it is.  1/3rd the Medical Cohort of Otago were refused graduation on grounds that Harlene Hayes (subsequently redeployed to Western Australia) refused to accept they had completed the internships the Uni sent them to even when they had their internships signed off by supervisors.  So they were told, then, that they could only go into 'Junior Doctor' positions in NZ hospitals if they agreed to keep paying the university for re-enrolment just keep paying the university just keep paying the university.  Just keep doing the 'work' while you pay the university just keep handing over everything to the 'university'.  Not even trying to be a 'university'.  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camp land.  Nasty nasty nation of slavers.  </p>

                                <p>They brought the euthanasia drugs in.  Apparently we have a 'science led' health system.  Who does the LD 50 on the euthanasia drugs, then?  It doesn't matter what any of the laws are when the Judiciary fails to uphold them.  There's nothing here.  I don't see how anybody can do business in this jurisdication because the courts fail to function.  Won't enrol people in law school.  Won't graduate them.  Won't pay lawyers to work that job.  Etc.  There's nothing here.  Not even trying to be fair.  Nasty nasty psychopaths.</p>

                                <p>  https://www.newsroom.co.nz/secret-manuals-shroud-justice-in-secrecy  Not even trying, indeed.  My guess would be that the Judiciary knows full well that the bench books are in such bad shape that it's a f*cking embarrassment.  That's why they don't want the information to be made public.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Therefore secrecy.  Not even an OIA request for information will have the government hand over the shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame inducing documents.  The shame shame shame state of things.  So we'll all be held victims and hostages to their shame, then.  No work can be done on making anything any better.  Because:  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.</p>
