                                <p>What is the aim of Tertiary Education, in New Zealand?  Is it to ensure that the people currently on payroll never need to retire from their positions?  In other words, to ensure that 'education' is about the prevention and prohibition of education and training and skills development so as to ensure the people currently on payroll are, and will remain to be, the only game in town?  That seems to be the aspirational goal or ideal of it.  To not educate or train or develop any kind of a work-force, at all.  Why would we graduate them -- then we would have to pay them?  Why would we pay them when we can collect their slave-work for free?</p>

                                <p>How much research output do the researchers on Univesrity payroll do every year?  Is it indistinguishable from the output of a computer programme?  Is it indistinguishable from them copying and pasting together the output of their first year class or the output of their graduate research students whose work they stole before they bullied them into fleeing the 'University' with no credit for the work they have done?</p>

                                <p>New Zealand says there is no point graduating students from our 'Universities' becuase we aren't going to pay them to do the work that they have trained for.  Teachers.  Nurses.  Doctors.  All the things, really.  We will cry cry cry cry cry cry cry about how there aren't any and refuse to acknowledge that the problem is that we refuse to pay them.  The people presently on payroll will have to die before there will be a job for anybody else, apparently.  They are the only game in town.  Don't acknowledge anybody else's qualifications.</p>

                                <p>How many psychiatrists did Dr Leeks train to do the kinds or sorts of things that he was up to?  How many applications to Medicine did he throw away to ensure he would remain the only game in town?  How many studnets did he refuse to sign off on?  Just keep working the internships.  Just one more internships.  Just keep handing over more and more and more research 'work' to  your supervisor.  We still aren't done assessing whether you have the capacity to do the job.  We only know that the people presently on payroll are the only game in town and there will be a job for you over their dead bodies, apparently.  Have to bring people in from overseas because there aren't any skilled and trained New Zealanders.  None acknowledged as such that aren't indisginguishable from a computer programme therefore why pay them when you can get a computer programme to do their work for no pay?</p>

                                <p>'There could be no evidence admitted that would attest to corruption within the New Zealand Government'.  That's a good output for the courts.  They can refuse to accept evidence, refuse to accept filings. It's at the Judges's discretion to order re-filing of the re-filing of the re-filing of the re-filings, apparently or allegedly.  And the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Courts say that it is contrary to the independence of the Judiciary for them to remind the Judiciary on expectations for timely judgment delivery.  That is or means to say, remind them that 5 months post-hearing a Judgement is awaited...  Still..  Everything is held up by the courts.  Apparently they are off sick and they are off on holiday.  Becuase they are the only game in town for their payroll and that, presumably, is precisely why they are paid.  Chris Whelan hasn't processed a single application of wrongdoing against any of the 'Universities' of NZ since he was appointed to CE of the NZVCC back in about 2014.  The Education and Training Act says the position is about upholding the quality and integrity of NZ Universities.  Only, there isn't any quality and integrity to NZ Universities, at all, by the seems of it.  They (regularly, reliably, systemically and systematically) say that 'personal problems' occur such that they refuse to process enrolment, completions etc.  They won't get students work out for external examination and they choose to employ people with little to no research output.  They aren't even trying to be fair at all.  The problem, then, is that the likes of Justice Toogood need to be pulled out of retirement and re-appointed as Judge presumably because there isn't anybody else who will be acknowledged willing or able to do that job until he's dead.  Over his dead body.  Re-appointing a retired Judge is not a proper process for appointing a Judge.  They are not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                                <p>New Zealand does not have a functioning health,  education and training, judiciary, at all.  It is written into the Australian Constitution that NZ is a state of the Federation of Australia.  There is a process involved in how they are to go about changing their constitution.  That involves a vote.  They don't get to say that various of NZ leaders simply failed to turn up to various meetings therefore NZ is no longer a State of Australia by consent.  They never gave the people voting papers and asked them if they wanted to be citizens of Australia or not.  What does it mean to be a citizen of Australia?  Australaian wages for government work.  Access to Australian education and training programmes.  Government employment.  They aren't even trying to be fair.  NZ says they will not sign off on NZ qualifications because qualified people will flee from NZ to Australia for wages since they won't pay them to do skilled work in NZ.  They are trafficking slaves around is all they are doing.  They are not even trying to be fair.</p>

                                <p>Who wins?  Foreign countries, I guess.  Who ensure that Australasia needs to keep turning to them for skilled anything since Australasia failed to develop education and training programmes etc.  The only leaders International Community will acknowledge or accept for this region are ones who ensure the lack of education and training systems, judiciary, health system etc etc.  There doesn't appear to actually be anything here, at all.  Not even trying to be fair.  Refusign to process filings.  Refusing to process applications to enrol.  Refusing to process qualification completions.  Refusing to employ skilled workers.  Refusing to pay the workers.  Insisting on re-appointing 'Judges' from retirement to see nothing wrong.  Insisting on employing Chris Whelan who cannot / won't do the job for which he is paid.  There is nothing here, at all.</p>

                                <p>And of course the jobs (insfoar as there are any) go to the people they were always going to go to.  The dependents.  Those kept dependent.  Those not willing or able to function or work independently.  That's the aim or the goal or the purpose or the point of the education and training system.  Right?  To output indistinguishable units so they can console themselves that it's entirely arbitrary who is picked for payroll and who is picked to slave since they are all much of a much of a much of a samey sameness.  It wasn't like Dr Leeks  or Dr Green (Pathology, from the Cartwright Inquiry) was doing anything any differently from what anybody and everybody else who was acknowledged as Pathologist or Psychiatrist would be doing.  Right?  The only game in town.  Let's have yet another courtcase where the victims can cry cry cry cry cry about how impactful the perpetrators were.  How they will never ever be forgotten.  If you can't be loved may as well be hated, right?  Let's sing a monument to these monumental figures and create a real motivation and incentivisation for people to become Medical Doctors in these lands.  The courts can give teeth to how bringing these issues before the courts will result in the victims paying the victims paying the victims paying the victims paying the victims paying to sing sing sing about just how monumental these figures were.  How these only game in town figures ruined so very very very very very many lives.  In a land that aspires to be sooooooooooo competitive.  All the money from the victims so they can pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the courts.  What judiciary?  There is nothing here.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  THey aren't processing applciations to Medicine.  They aren't processing completions from training.  They are intentionally not doing these things so that they can dedeploy the likes of Dr Leeks around in order specifically to see how many lives can be declared 'incapacitated' and 'disabled' and the like.  How many lives they can claim to have ruined.</p>

                                <p>War on the people.  Think how how the politicians and various leaders think of the function of role of education.  Knowledge is power, apparently.  Why would those in power voluntarily choose to share power?  Why would they want to pursue equality or fairness?  Psychopaths.  There's nothing here.</p>
