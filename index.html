    <p>Universities in Australasia are choosing to function as detention, prison, slave camps.  The Australian National University is refusing to process applications to enrol on the basis of academic merits.  They state that they do not have the willingness or ability to supervise graduate research.  But I am sure that they enrolled other students when they said that to me.  I mean to say they are not being fair on how they choose which children of the administration to give what enrollments or qualifications to.  I have posted on the writing page various theses that I have given various Universities.  They were supposed to help me with my research (check Kim Sterelny's outbox for evidence of him doing his job I don't think you will find any) or, at the very least, get my work out to external examiners so it can be externally examined on it's academic merits, in a timely fashion.  Various universities refuse to get work out to externals.  The University of Waikato keeps false enrolment records and false transcripts, now (recording that students have failed qualifications that they never even applied to be enrolled in!)  The Inland Revenue keeps false records about student debt when the Universities record that students were enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled so the Univesrity can collect up more and more money from the Australasian Governments for keeping the students detained as hostages or slaves.  The work, meanwhile, is given to third parties so that others can receive credit for it.  Others are given paid research positions (I guess they were the only applicants, theirs were the only applications acknowledged, they were the only game in town, nobody else wanted or applied for that job, nobody else can have the job, generations can be sent to the prison slave detention camps because certain special snowflakes need to have 3x or 4x or 5x the FTE payroll of everybody else).
    </p>

    <p>There is really nothing there.  It is in the Australasian Constistution that NZ is a state of Australia.  If they don't like it then there is a process for changing the Australian Constitution.  It involves supplying voting papers to New Zealanders.  Which they have never done.  They simply refuse to uphold the Constitution.  That is the state of Australasia.  Not even trying to be rule by law, not even a little teeny tiny bit.  Apparently it is also a thing that you are supposed to hire locals where possible.  Only recruit from overseas when there isn't anybody locally willing and / or able to work that job.  But they repeatedly throw away applications from locals so as to hire foreigners to come to these lands and help the administration keep the bulk of the people in these lands detained, imprisoned, slaving as slaves.  For example, various academic posts are given to people who were born in, educated in, graduated from overseas institutions.  Even the present Vice Chancellor of the University of Auckland has no ties whatsover to this region while she takes around three quarters of a million dollars for herself each and every year to keep various people, in NZ, slaving as slaves.  While the University of Auckland refuses to supply applications to enrol to domestic adults (who are eligible to be enrolled in programmes they have applied to by statute) in order to fill up the courses with teenagers (who are eligible for free secondary education until they have attained the age of 20 years) so the government can record higher and higher and higher levels of debt against their name while keeping them as uneducated as possible so as to try and conceal that Bart Simpson gets to be safety inspector of the powerplant (for example) because Homer simply refused to 'train' anybody else.  And of course Homer is the only game in town.  He's the only application they acknowledge as having received and they simply refused to look at employing anybody else.  </p>

    <p>They won't pay anybody to work the social service jobs.  There aren't social services in these parts.  Just various ways of keeping people (who they don't view or see as people) as impoverished and deprived and sickly as possible.  Try and breed, for the world, a gamma baby population of uneducated and impoverished slaves.  The leaders seem to think that their job or role is in managing or keeping the detention or prison camp of the world.  Nobody was held to account for actrocities around the end of WWII and the governments in this region seem to take themselves to be still be at it.  The Judiciary fails to function.  I guess because the judges were largely selected on the basis of who their daddy was.  Then it is like they pretend not to speak English.  Not capable of parsing the relatively simple statutes (e.g., regarding the statutory function of NZVCC to progress complaints of wrongdoing e.g., regarding the statutory function of Universities to progress applications to enrol from domestic adults e.g., regarding the statutory function of Universities to uphold academic freedoms of students and to be engaged in research).  And / or simply not willing to uphold them.  There isn't anything in this part of the world.  Not the developed world at all.  Simply chooses not to be.  </p>

    <p>The government seems to think that the laws are a tool that the government uses to oppress the people.  By, for example, imprisoning the likes of Brian Tamaki because they simply don't like what he has to say.  That is the function of police (to arrest him and take him to Mt Eden prison).  The function of crown law is to respond to what the Prime Minister has to say about whether someone will be prosecuted.  I mean, if she asks for someone to be prosecuted by the government on political grounds or for political reasons then that is the only reason that seems to matter when it comes to crown law.  The fact that the Universities are keeping false enrolment records and false transcripts and falsely reporting enrolments so as to falsely record false levels of debt against peoples names to that the government can keep them detained and imprisoned slaving slaving slaving without so much as Australian passport...  That's just how things don't work in this part of the world.  Not the developed world at all.  Not even trying to be.  There aren't any universities.  What research output?  Computer generated, much of it.  Or stolen / reattributed to managers and the like who don't actually do any work.  Just collect up all the money.  There's nothing here.</p>

    <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/opinion/130581219/damien-grant-when-an-activist-judiciary-invites-itself-to-the-party  I see...  I didn't know the Bill of Rights stated 16 was the age of adulthod.  Parliament needs to look at increasing that to 18 or, better still 20.  Focus on upholding the rights of children.  They do keep the age young or low (while cry cry crying about how we are doing better than some other country where they actually marry the kids off at 14 rather than just pimping them out for the hour or weekend or year or two to their 'teachers' or 'pediatricians' or 'coaches')...  The Education and Training Act states that you have the right to a secondary education until you are 20 at which point you are eligible to have your application processed for tertiary education.  But, of course, they intentionally market tertiary education to teenagers and fill up the training places with teenagers recording levels of debt against their name and refusing to regard 20 year olds to be eligible. </p>

    <p>My understanding was that IF there is a remedy in statute then that is the remedy.  I mean to say, if parliament has stipulated a remedy in statute (e.g., that a fine of no more than x shall be applied to each instance of a violation or breech of a statute) then the Judiciary's power to provide remedy is constrained  by the contents of the statute.  When the statute does not provide a specific remedy then they are leaving it open to the courts to decide what seems to be just or fair in that case given the facts of the case.  If the judiciary is providing remedy that parliament does not think is fair then parliament can work on changing the laws so as to constrain the judiciary.  Damages, for example, have precedent in the rulings of the courts, or some judicial reasoning so that decisions aren't unprincipled.  What remedy is fair for universities enslaving people for however many years refusing to supply them with qualifications they have earned, refusing to enrol them in progammes they have applied to, refusing to teach them anything, in some instances, refusing to sign off on completion of training?  What is the purpose or function of remedy?  What needs to happen to get the Universities following the law?  At the moment the VC takes three quarters of a million dollars per year in order to refuse to follow the education and training act when it comes to processing applications.  Giving training places to children (recording levesl of debt against their name) and refusing to enrol and progress and refusing to allow externals to sign off on completion of training of domestic adults in order to keep people detained, imprisoned, slaving.  Slaves.  While pimping out the children.  What a f*cking farce.</p>
