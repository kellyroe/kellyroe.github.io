Fit to be a medical graduate.  Fit to be employed to practice medicine.  Fit to be responsible for however many children placed into his care.  Ooops, no, sorry, he was given them to do anything anything anything anything..  How many medical students did he train?  How many studnets did internships with him?  How many medical studnets did he sign off on as having completed their training?  Was nobody declared fit to practice, by him?  He was un-rivalled?  Unsurpassed?  Nobody was fit to work *with* him.  Not *under him*.  Not next in line to practice..  He was the only one declared fit to practice.  Him.  Only him.  There was no other game in town.  He's fit to do anything anything anything.  Until it comes time for him to be responsible. Accountable.  At which point he is declared not fit.  He was fit to take how much money, how much taxpayers funding?  He was fit to be paid how much to do what, now?  He was fit enough for that.  But not fit enough to display any responsibility.  Any accountabilty.  Not fit enough for that.  F*cking psychopaths.  They moved him to Melbourne to ensure that he could continue on offending.  THat he could continue on with his crimes.  WHAT MEDICAL SYSTEM?  WHAT HEALTH SYSTEM?  F*CKING PSYCHOPATHS.  THERE ISN'T ANYTHING THERE.  THEY CAN'T EVEN, WON'T EVEN PROCESS AN APPLICLATION TO ENROL.  NOT UNLESS IT COMES FROM A F*CKING PSYCHOPATH.  NOBODY THERE.  NOTHING HOME.  TELL IT TO THE PEDOPHILE JUDGES PULLED OUT OF RETIREMENT -- BECAUSE OF WHY, AGAIN?  So they can take all and only the law firms interns who were trained to shut up about the partners crimes.  THe only law firm that trains high court judges.  Nobody seriously thinks that the most junior Maaori partner was the only one (the one) guilty of sexual offending with regards to the interns?  Seriously?  WHY WAS HE PICKED TO BE JUINOR PARTNER.  F*CKING PSYCHOPATHS.  GET OUT!!!!! F*CKING WELL DIE, ALREADY< PSYCHOPATHIC FREAKS!@!!!!  </p>
                            <p>'The Singularity' is just an excuse.  It goes like this:  'Wasn't me -- must have been the singularlity'.  For example 'I'm not racist.  I programmed the computer to approve or deny people visas on the basis of race but that is the computer / the singularity's fault -- not mine, the programmer'.  Never was there better reason to believe in the singularity!  Wasn't me!!!!</p>

                            <p>Wasn't the people paid to assess application's fault that the singularity expeidited the teenage daughter of the VC into medicine enrolment and choked and died and killed and removed and failed to process and removed from processing any aplications from anybody else.  That's how competitive it is.  The singularity made everybody do it.  Was the singularity's fault.  They write the judgments for the only Judges on payroll -- that is to say the ones who were required to have been retired (by law).  The only ones acnowledged by singularity!  All heil the singularity!  Only game in town!!!</p>

                            <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/europe/300962986/98yearold-charged-over-role-at-nazi-concentration-camp  Awwwwwwwwwwwww!  Awwwwwwwwwwwwww!  Awwwww poor him!  He should have moved to NZL.  Then he could have lived out the rest of his days not having to worry about being expedited to stand trial.  ANd think of the atrocties, in NZL he could have gone on to committ!  Poooor him!  It isn't like what he was doing was any different to what anybody else was doing!  Wasn't any different from what anybody else on payroll was doing!  Wasn't any different from what anybody else on payroll is doing!  Isn't any different from anything and everything it is that we value!  All heil the mighty leader!  Everything that everybody was and is and ever aspires to be!  A real winner in teh life-game the game of life the only game of life worth playing! ALL Heil everything that it is that we value!  Maybe the only place in the world that he ever would actually be called to account is..  Germany today.  I suppose there is that.  Slooooowwww doooooown NZL.  Sloooooooower.  Slooooooooower.  Sllooooooow doooooooown NZL...... </p>

                            <p>Wah wah wah!!! NZL doesn't have any politicians!!! What politicians do you see?  All the politicians voted out of every other place in the world will be volunteered to move to NZL and be put to work as the elected officials of NZL!!! Nobody from NZL wants to work that job.  It's soooooooo competitive that nobody got to work that job.  ALl of the politicians voted out of every other nation will get to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the visa processing fees to get to move to NZL.  ANd pay and pay and pay and pay and pay all the twits to be like share and subscribed for all of the arses on farcebook to supposedly like share and subscribe or upvote or some such nonsense.  F*cking retards.  Would have things no other way.</p>

                            <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/497056/overseas-trained-doctors-working-for-call-centres-uber-due-to-nz-registration-difficulties  Well, now, the only reason Shane Reti is registered to practice as a GP is because he won't spend more than 1-3 weeks practicing as a GP per year (he will spend most of his time as 'elected' parlimentarian.)  What does he do with his 1-3 weeks of regsitered GP labor?  What does he do?  See his entire patient case-load?  Every illness that they have, that they need to schedule a GP for is to be heard by him in 1-3 weeks that he actually practices each and every year.  They would register him no other way.  What does he do in the 1-3 weeks.  Take a look, then, at the referrrals he writes for specailist care or treatment and the prescriptions he writes (for a year's worth of amphetamines?)  I mean, f*cking well think about it.  What does Ayesha do?  Is she registered to practice immunology?  Really?  ANd he has a house in Malaysia...  And what does she have to do in getting more and more and more and more money to be paid in 'visa processing fees' to that various people can be trafficked to NZL and put to 'work' as what, exactly? They just can't suicide themselves fast enough.  Say the only people you would pay to do autopsy's or coroner's reports.  F*cking psychopaths!!!  It takes the application and it f*cking well processes it -- in accordance with the laws as f*cking well written.  *It really isn't supposed to be that f*cking hard.  F*cking psychopaths!)  </p>

                            <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/300962816/shelly-bay-sale-to-peter-jackson-and-fran-walsh-bittersweet-for-mayor-tory-whanau  Well, everybody knows that 'affordable housing' will only degrade and destroy the local environment, wherereas 'unaffordable housing' will inevitably lead to..  Um.  Great to see the motivation and inspiration and true genius behind our leadership.  Our 'leadership'.  I'm sorry.  Best advertise for international audience only and see who you can lure with false promises.  There's nothing here.  Determinedly.  </p>

                            <p>So I really really really want to know..  What happened to the VC's daughter..  THe VC of the 'university' of Queensland.  He used his position to give his daughter a place in Medical Degree programme (he stole the place from someone who actually earned it)..  What happened to her?  I heard that she was graduated.  Even though she didn't earn her entry apparently her daddy didn't need to pay for others to sit her graduation examinations for her, or do her internships for her.  Apparently he only needed to beg borrow steal or bribe her way into the Medical School and apparently she earned her way through and out of it (snigger, guffaw, yeah, right) where is she now?  I'm wondering because..  Well, I guess if she finds herself surrounded by child molesting murdering psychopathic malevolent incompetents..  She can't exactly speak.  Say anytihng.  Protest.  I mean she was cheated her way in so she doesn't have any right to speak out about other cheats and incompetents.  Right?  So, I wonder, what is she up to now?  What is she doing?  The public has a right to know.  Was she regarded to have passed her STEP examinations?  She practicing in Florida?  The aged care institutions over there?  She claiming to have found worms in the brains of people (she did not plant them there herself) in Canberra?  She flying around the Northern Terrotory?  Finding Kuru in the populations of New Guinea?  Where is she now?  The public have the right to know.  So that they can avoid this person who cheated their way in.  Who would not get out once the fact that they cheated was made public.  What is her name now?  What is she up to now?  She in prison?  How about daddy dearest?  He still in Australia or he retire into state institutions of FLorida or similar?  Managing teh public medical schools over there?  Oh, please tell us.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                            <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/world/496892/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-voice-to-parliament-referendum-date-announced  Who cares what the Federation of Australian Constitution says? Who cares?  They refuse to uphold their constitution as it is currently written.  So who cares, what difference does it make, how they plan to change it, or not.  They refuse to uphold it (no matter what it says) that is all that matters.  That is all that you need to know.  What does it say?  It says that NZ is the second named state of the Federation of Australia.  So where are the voting papers, for the people born in NZL to decide whether or not to alter the constitution of Australia, as wrote?  WHere are the voting papers for people born in the second named state of the federation of Australia?  Nobody cared whether or not the NZ governmetn consented to being a state of Australia or not.  Nobody cared.  The voting papers get to the people.  I'm sorry..  The government is too f*cking stupid to know what 'it has been provided that' meeeeeeeeans.  Too f*cking retarded in the brains.  HOoked up to those fisher and paykal incubators from birth and 'educated' in their 3 year con-munications degrees!!!!  F*cking retards...</p>

                            <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/496914/visas-of-offshore-migrants-linked-to-employers-under-investigation-cancelled-minister-says  So the 'education system' then?  Can't get visas to do graduate study in NZ -- because they won't acknowledge the full-time work that the graduate research students do after they arrive.  THey take their work and they won't get it out to externals and allow the externals to sign them off (the qualification is the payment for them having done the work for the qualification.  But they aren't allowing the students to get the qualification so they can get more money for more visa processing and re re re re re enrolllment.  The secondary schools weren't paying the teachers.  Weren't paying the teachers.  Weren't paying the teachers.  The domestic teachers.  Refusing to accept they had completed their qualifications.  Refusing to accept they had completed their internships.  They can pay and pay and pay and pay the 'university' for re re re re enrolment while they are put to 'work' in the schools in the name of 'internships' but they will not pay them.  THey will not pay the teachers.  People coming to NZ from Fiji etc needing to live in the basement of the principle's house -  becuase they would't pay them.</p>

                            <p>I thought the idea was to pay them in sex trade.  In exchange for the foreign hostage living in the principle's house they would get to do anything anything anything to the kiddies in the schools.  Or, at least, they would shut up about what the other people (particularly those on payroll) were doing in the schools.  Maybe even what the principle is doing in the schools.  I mean, when they don't pay you it must be that you are passionate about it.  Who isn't more passionate than a pedophile about working with the kiddies?  They won't pay them they won't pay them they won't pay them.  Starve everybody else out so only the pedophiles remain.  That was the great plan for never having to pay anybody to work in the health sector.  Right?  We'd just stock it, staff it with murderers and pedophiles and rapists.  They'd 'work' the 'job' for free!  Cheapest 'employees' ever!  Don't forget to pay for your visa to be re re re re processed!  Don't forget to shut up about all the crimes!  Don't forget to  hire the likes of Chris Whelan into position and pay and pay and pay  him hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to throw all the complaints of wrong-doing away!  What it is that wae most value!  Sterelnly sing sing singing the praises about all the f*cking psychopaths!  *There's nothing there*.  WHat health system?  What education system?  F*cking psychopaths.  'Sorry'!  Aw...  'Sorry!'  But it isn't like it is any different from what anybody else is doing!  THe pedophiiles and rapists and abusers are the only 'people' we see!!!!  It's sooooo competitive!!!!  Sooooo hostile!!!! All the 65+++ who won't get out after more than 45 years of government payroll!!!! It's soooo f*cking hostile!!!!  Soooooo competititive!!!!</p>

                            <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/496873/police-ambulance-and-mental-health-co-response-teams-to-be-rolled-out-nationwide  You called the police?  You must be mentally ill!  Someone tried to kill you, abuse you, maim you, hurt you, you must be doing it to yourself!  The people from NZ can't kill themselves fast enough -- didn't you know?  Everything everything everying to be non-voluntariliy drugged with date rape drugs etc etc in the  name of psychiatry.  How old are you?  Still a teenager?  Must sign you up for 'last resort' treatments from Professor Glue.  The immigrant medical graduates giving the date rape drugs to the teenagers of Dunedin.  Quickly quickly quickly expedite selection for foreigners who will get busy date rape drugging the teenagers  of Dunedin.  Nobody else need apply to Medical School.  Nobody else need apply to 'work' in the ED.  Only game in town.  Only game in town.  Only game in town.  Will  have things no other way.  Cannot even process an application on the  basis  of academic merits.  Can't even calculate a GPA.  THere's nothing there ffs.  REstructure it out of existence then once you've killed it go ruin the University of Western Australia.  Well done Harlene Hayes.  Psychopath from the USA, wasn't she?  Why didn't they expedite her to ruin the Universities over in America?  Why did NZ have to take her?  Nobody from here could possibly work that job.  Oxygen deprived at birth, they were, in their Fisher and Paykal Incubators.  QUite by design.  </p>

                            <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/science/300959963/stronger-than-tnt-the-vials-of-acid-that-saw-a-bomb-squad-called-to-a-university  Probably what you would do is go in at night.  During the down-time.  When you don't need to evacuate much in the way of anybody at all and when you can most safely detonate explosives in the domain.  In the stealth of night.  When nobody is anywhere near close to the situation.  But that way you don't get to see the..  Uh..  Hundreds -- was it?  Hundreds of thousands -- was it?  All the students and staff.  The faculty.  The researchers.  All of the people based in Grafton Campus.  How many of them walked out the front door when it was evacuation time.  Uh..  What's that?  *NOBODY HOME*.  Nothing there.  Nothing to see -- at all.  What, then of all the student doctors and nurses and optometrists and..  Ahahahahhahahahahahahah they pay and they pay and they pay and they pay and they pay for visa *entry* to NZL.  And in NZL..  Uh..  Nothing to see.  Nobody home, at all...) </p>

                            <p>Oh my it's sooooo competitive!  It's sooooooo copmetitive that the only applicant to MPhil in Philosophy with the University of Waikato (the *ONLY APPLICANT* at the institution whose primary function (according to statutory law of NZ) is research.. It is *sooooo competitive* that the *only applicant*...  Cannot possibly have their application processed..  Cannot have adequate supervision...  Cannot have their work forwarded to externals..  It's sooooo competitive..  It's soooo competitive..  That the ONLY applicant..  It's sooooo competitive.  Now we understand the nature of the competition.  It's sooooo competitive to get into Medical School.  All the applications from domestic adults are thrown away and only teenagaers else international teenagers (non-domestic) will have more and more and more debt recorded against their name.  It's sooooo competitive.  It's soooooooo competitive..  There is no competition.  Because there actually is nothing there in fact.  What 'University'?  What 'health system'?  What 'judciary'?  The dumb and f*cking dumber show in fact.  *There's nothing there*.  It's soooo competitive!  Alllll of the mone for Kim Sterelny and various others over 65 years (after 45+ years of government payroll they never figured self-suficiency.  Even after all that could not even figure so much as a start-up to invest in.  Alll of the payroll for them, therefore.  They never made it to financial independence.  All of the governmetn salary they got for 45+ years and they were still too much of a f*cking fitness trap to get to financial independence.  Why, then, did the government choose to invest in them instead of the likes of me?  Go figure.  All heil the mighty and illustrious Dr Leeks!!  Sooooo motivational and inspirational!  The only game in town!  ALL Heil the current state (future prospects for) Meidcine and University and Government..  There's nothing to see!!! There's nothing nothing nothing, at all!!!</p>

                            <p>How much do they pay for a little brown baby?  A little Rubi Tui.  Don't worry, we impregnaged the mother when she was in a state care institution (psychiatric or hospital or prison or whatever) and we removed it under sedation without any kind of informed consent, as is our way.  Now, how much can the government get for it on the international market do you suppose?  Just tell the mother that it died.  Else arrange for the mother to die in state care.  Else blackbird the mother into believing that she's incompetent and so on and so forth.  She can't tell when it's cold or when conditions are inhumane.  It's clearly the most socially responsible thing to do.  Sell the baby to international investors.  It's all about the people the people the people.  Right?  And NZL trafficks in meat.  Of whatever variety.  Therei sno informed consent. What people?  Animals.  Not kept half as well as foreigners keep their pets in fact.  What people?  What people in NZL?  There's nobody home.  Nothing there in fact.  Don't take it personally.  The Australian Natioanl Univesrity can't  /   won't process applications to enrol.  Can't / won't get studnets work out for external examination.  There's nobody home.  Nothing there, in fact.</p>

                            <p>How many years of work did the ANU take from Dave Wall before he got to the point of being hospitalised?  And then what did you do to him?  Give him thamine before glucose and blame him for the fact that you didn't do the most basic of things that you were supposed to do regarding getting his work out for timely external examination.  F*cking psychopaths.  In fact.  F*cking psychotics.  Take Kim Sterelny and his wife to boot.  You can f*cking well have them.  The dumb and f*cking dumber show, I swear.  Make it to slavery?  Australia?  Make it out of the f*cking 'we are apes and our graduate studnets are evolved apes' to slavery?  Have we discovered or realised slavery yet?  F*cking psychotics.  There's nothing there, hey.  Can't even parse the constitution that they wrote.  Nobody home.  F*cking ratards.</p>

                            <p>Waiting for the social security appeals authority to overturn the ministry of social development's declaration that 'justice not essential need'.  It hasn't been overturned when the substantive hearing of the issue was more than 9 months ago.</p>

                            <p>This is so that cases can be heard on appeal.  The High Court Judges were (in 2 instances) re-appointed into position from retirement.  NZ has a compulsory age of retirement for Judges and the Judges are required to get out once they hit that age.  These 'Judges' were required to have gotten out.  They were not appointed  by proper process at all, because there is no proper process for re-appointing Judges past the age of their retirement.  Why am I having to explain this?  NZ is not even trying to be rule by law, at all.  What judiciary?</p>

                            <p>The 'Universities' of NZ are not properly processing applications to enrol, graduations etc.  They refuse to comply with the education and training act. They refuse to comply with Tertiary Edcuation Commission Guidelines.  Chris Whelan is paid upwards of several hundred thousands of dollars every year to take all the complaints that he receives every year and declare each and every one of them (since he was appointed to office in about 2014) to not be a complaint of serious wrongdoing, at all.  He refuses to follow the policy that the NZVCC wrote that it would follow when it receives complaints.  He refuses to get evidence to police.  He refuses to bring issues (or allow complainants to bring issues) before the NZVCC.  Not even trying to comply with the statutory laws or government policy documents of NZ.  Judges hauled out of retirement for the occassion cannot / will not see anything wrong.  There are none so blind as those who will not see.</p>

                            <p>It is soooo competitive!  The University of Otago refuses to calculate my full time GPA for Medicine.  That's how competitive it is.  THe point or purpose of the 'alternative' category is to provide a justification for them enrolling studnets who have never studied at tertiary level at all.  Those without so much as a tertiary GPA.  That's how competitive it is.  How academically competitive it is to do medicine.  It's sooooo competitive that they will give training places to Australians -- who, presumably, did not get entry to any of the Medical schools over in Australia.  It's soooo competitive that Otago would rather enrol Australians without any tertiary GPA than bother calculating the GPA of anybody from New Zealand.  That's how competitive it is.  It's soooo competitive that the issue or  problem must be lack of social skills.  But that wasn't the problem when I was an English Major.  The problem must  be that I interview badly.  But everybody else says that I interview fine.  Okay.  Presentable.  Have done many presentations.  So that's not the problem, either.  Take a look at the people they preferentially select from overseas.  HOw personable is Professor Glue, would you say?  It's sooooo competitive!  Oh my, it's soooo competitive!  It is important to rightly understand the nature of the competition, hey.  Poor Dr Leeks.  Poor Professor Glue.  Quickly quickly quickly expedite them into position and payroll them for 45 ++ years.  There will be no other way.  Only over their dead bodies.  Wouldn't you say?</p>

                            <p>The Supreme Court of NZ declares that it is not a matter of public interest that NZ Universities are not properly processing applications to enrol in MBChB (Medicine) or graduate research qualifictions.  That they are keeping false records about enrolments including sending false information to the Inland Revenue Department.  Saying studnets have been enrolled in programmes they never applied to.  Refusing to get work that has been submitted for external examination out for external examination.  What Universities?  What judiciary?  WHat health system?  They aren't processing applications for Medical School.  They aren't processing graduations.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  There's nothing there.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>Poor Dr Green.  Poor Dr Leeks.  It isn't like what they were doing was any different from what any other Medical Doctor was doing.  What they ARE doing.  All of the qualities that we value.  Expedited into position quickly quickly quickly by throwing everybody else's application away.  Professor Glue's Glue Factory is the only game in town.  Declaring (particularly young females) to be treatment resistent and feeding them horse tranquilier, ketamine, LSD...  As a first treatment last resort...  Auckland busying itself manufacturing ketamine and LSD...  Anything easy and cheap.  Anything...  Abusive.  Not keeping medical records of prescribed medications.  Drugging people in the 'hospitals' and likely the prisons etc as well.  Tool for gaslighting (it's not cold!  There must be something wrong with you!  It's all in your head!)  Bullying and abuse.  Only game in town.  Everybody else's application thrown away.  Better re re re re re apply for visas, all you foreigners, so that you can come to NZ and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the 'Universities' to do anything anything anything everything Professor Glue says (in return you can do a little anything anything to the victims, no doubt, I mean who would believe them anyway)?  Right?  What health system?  What University?  What Medical SChool?  What judiciary?  Not even trying to be rule by law.  Will not properly process applications to Medicine.  Throwing the theses away.  Throwing the theses away.  Will not acnkowledge research output.  Poor Dr Leeks.  Poor Dr Green.  Poor Professor Glue.  It isn't like what they are doing is any different or any worse to anything that anybody else on payroll is doing.  NZ refused to have or allow things to be any other way.  F*cking psychopaths.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>The Education and Training Act says that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are ELIGIBLE to be enrolled in the programme they have applied to.  The 'Universities' refuse to accept this and the courts refuse to uphold the laws.  They preferentially record that teenagers (under 20) have been enrolled in Tertiary Education (often levels of debt against their name) when it is in the law books that they are entitled to a free secondary education until they are 20.  The 'Universities' throw away applications from domestic adults.  They will not do it.  They will nto process the applications to enrol.  They also will not get studnets work to external examiners.  They refuse to allow qualification completions.  They will not do it.  They record re re re re re enrolment in qualifications when the requirements for them have been met by the studnet years ago.  Decades ago, in some instances.  THey are not even trying to be an education system, at all.  HOstages.  Slaves.  There's actually nothing there.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                            <p>Hey, I know..  Instead of processing my application to Medical School in accordance with the policy and procedure documents that there are (it takes enters the full time undergraduate GPA into the selection algorithm along with interview score and UMAT / UCAT score and it outputs the rank order score) they can give the places to the childeren of the administration who can explain to them that if they do anything anything their superiors say for x y z number of years then they themselves can get on to committing all the crimes and absues of Dr Green and Leeks and they can start up their very own Professional Glue Factory.  The spoils of war!   </p>

                            <p>And the government can just pay or pay off (or something) however many people to say 'sorry' in a too little too late  manner or way.  Mostly what it is about is ensuring that the structures and people expedited into position are in place to ensure that all of the everything we value continues on.  Poor Dr Leeks.  Poor Dr Green.  Poor Professor Glue.  Send Professor Glue overseas to conference..  See how much money he can raise for NZ in visa application fees after selling to foreigners this ideology of them coming to NZ and doing anything anything anyting tehy want with complete and utter impunity.</p>

                            <p>How much does it cost to dump your wife in Hillmorton, these days, and be made or declared bachelor, again?  Acknowledged by NZ in the international papers as being a consultant Orthopedic Surgeon?</p>

                            <p>This lady who was found to be killing babies in England.  She never would have been discovered for that if only she had have chosen to move to NZ.  Firstly, we don't keep records on such things.  Secondly, it isn't like her records would be any different from anybody else's on payroll.  Right?  </p>

                            <p>kim.com advertising or marketing to everyone in the world how they can move to NZ if they may be prosecuted for crimes overseas.  Move to NZ and never be extradited to stand trial overseas.  NZ is the prison camp detention camp of the world.  By design.  </p>

                            <p>That seems to be the ideology -- right?  The Australiain Constitution declares NZ to be the second named state of Australia (it was provided in the constitution regardless of whether NZ government consents or not).  The process for changing the constitution requires the people to be given voting papers.  They refuse to supply voting papers to people born in NZ.  Australia chooses to govern Australia like a prison detention camp.  Standford prison experiment come to life with being divise and appointing overlords to bully and abuse everybody else.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  No ideology of equality.  It's a hostile and competitive environment.  How is cooperation even possible at all?  What cooperation?  F*cking psychopaths.  Bullies.  ABusers.  Not even trying to be fair.  Not even trying to be rule by law.  What people?  WHat people do you see?</p>

                            <p>Professor Faull (he takes the Fall haha -- get it?) and his brain bank.  I think the idea is that people in the US pick out the little brown babies and inplant force detection devices into their teeth sockets so they can measure the shaking and smashing and so on that goes on in the state care institutions else by their parents else in the name of national sport.  Maybe feed them a little rabbit or human diseased liver to see if you can induce a little Kuru.  Take the Parkinson's brains of people and mash it up and get that into the food chain.  Why?  To create an entire nation of 'i'm soooo lucky I'm a gamma  baby I don't have to work half as hard as Ashley Bloomfield' or whatever.  The point, really, is to kill and autopsy the brain on demand.  On cue.  The little experimental subjects.  Need to observe the effects of kuru over time.  Neurodegeneration.  Probably starting with the neurodegeneration of the infants kept in the Fisher and Paykal Incubators, I would say. Target the most vulnerable.  Line up the holes in the swiss cheese to target the most vulnerable.  It's sooooo comeptitive!  Oh my!  It's sooooo competitive!  What health system?  WHy would anybody wnat to  help anybody else?  Right Sterelny?  It's soooooo competitive!  Oh my!  It's sooooo competitive!  Such a hostile world!  Oooooh it's sooooo competitive!  How old is 'It takes the faull' anyway?  Where are all the kiddies he trained?  Or ate?  Or something???</p>

                            <p>How old is Grant Gillet?  Still on payroll?  How old is Sterelny?  Still on payroll?  Justice Toogood etc etc..  Oh my! It is like the payroll never stops for them!  The next generation should just voluntarily die all volutnarily like (they have been volunteered) so that these f*cking psychopathic freaks can have enough to raise a whole harem after more than 45 years of government payroll!  Of of the everything for them!  It's sooooo competitive!  Nobody other than them could possibly do any of the things that they do!  F*ckign psychopathic freaks.  Get the f*ck out.  Only over their dead bodies,  hey.  F*ckign hurry up and die you f*cking c*nts.  Hey.  NOthing Sterelny wouldn't say to me.  Right?  F*cking hurry up and die, you f*cking freak.  HOw many years did Carl Brusse hand over doctoral work to you?  How many years did Dave Wall?  F*cking psychotics.  You.   Yes, you.  F*cking freak.  Get the f*ck out.  F*ck off, mate. Is it f*cking well dead yet?</p>
