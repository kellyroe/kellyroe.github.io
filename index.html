    <p>Australasia seems to have chosen not to have Universities.  Instead  they have a series or  system of detention camps, prison camps, or slave camps up and down the land.  Apparently it is entirely at their discretion if they enrol students or not, what they enrol students in (if anything), whether students are recorded as having graduated or failed, and whether they are enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled so that the 'University' can collect up more and more and more money from the government and / or the 'student'.  Apparently it is at their discretion whether or not they hire academics who are willing and able to supervise or whether they give them money in exhchange for them not supervising, not getting their students work to examiners, not entering students grades into the system in order to keep the studnet indefinately detained.  Apparently it is at their discretion that they can keep work indefinately detained in the name of examination and also at their discretion whether they get it to externls.  It is even at their discretion to fail the student out entirely so as to reattribute their work to others or to give it to the government for it to be censored and witewashed.  The University administration thinks that they have unlimited discretion to choose to enrol (for example) the children of the adminisration into the qualifications they themselves believe to be high value (e.g., Medicine and Law) and they are entitlted to make decisions on non-academic grounds.
    </p>

    <p>The University of Auckland, University of Otago, University of Waikato, Australian National University are all refusing to process applications on the basis of the academic merits of the applicant.  They believe that the University gets to choose what (if any) Degree is right for you on grounds that are different from academic.  To be clear, these are not private Universities, any of them.  They are responsible for limiting entry to programmes such as Medicine and Law and Engineering and Teaching Accounting and so on.  So that we find ourselves in positions whereby wrongful death after wrongful death after sexual violation after wrongful death because, apparently, there is no alternative.  Nobody is willing or able to work that job except for a few special snowflakes required to have 3x or 4x or 5x the FTE salaries of everybody else in exchange or return for the role they are playing in keeping people unlawfully detained slaving imprisoned up and down these lands.
    </p>

    <p>They are supposed to hire locals where possible rather than hiring foreigners to work positions where they are keeping locals as hostages or slaves.  For example, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Auckland was born overseas, raised overseas, educated overseas with no ties to Australasia.  But she gets three quarters of a million dollars per year because she is only supposed to be temporary, one can only suppose, sent her in order to completely and utterly undermine or stabotage the University of Auckland, one can only suppose.  For the good of England, or something, who will seem posiitively attractive, by comparison, so as to motivate and incentive the elite government officials in New Zealand to pay to pay to pay to pay to pay to send their kids overseas in the hope that they have Universities since we don't, one can only suppose.  Various people, in New Zealand, picked to come here from overseas in order to keep the people from New Zealand detained and slaving as prisoners.  The way the Australasian Government chooses to Govern is like they have come here or been picked out to run a detention prison camp slave colony.  That is how they choose to Govern still.  It is in the Constitution of Australia that New Zealand is a State of Australia.  They cry cry cry cry cry about how they refuse to accept that for various reasons.  But if they don't like it then there is a process they are required to follow for changing their Constitution.  It involves supplying voting papers to New Zealanders which they have never done.  They choose to use New Zealand as an off-shore detention camp refusing to allow New Zealanders to freely travel to Australia and withholding Australian Passports and Voting Papers and telling them they are not entitled to any of the benefits of Citizenship.  They refuse to process applications for Government Employment and certain Education and Training Programmes (e.g., HECS supported Medicine).  Even when HECS is fairly clearly and obviously the idea, quite literally, of the Government choosing to put a HEX on you since they will keep you enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled while (if they happen to choose to) refusing to supervise you or train you, refusing to get your work out to examiners, refusing to do the job for which they are paid, collecting up more and more and more and more money for keeping you, often while you are actually put to 'work' (as in 'get in there and have a go and maybe you pull it off despite us or in spite of us and most certainly never because of us') while they collect up more and more and more money for themselves.</p>

    <p>Australasia does not have an Education and Training System.  The Social Services do not function.  No education, no judiciary.  The Judges refuse to uphold the law.  The Australian National University refuses to accept that studnets lodge complaints of wrongdoing.  You complain and they instruct you to 'revise and resubmit your complaint' because they refuse to accept it.  The Vice Chancellor's office has seen that I have been asked to revise and resumbmit my complaint to them 4 times and they are still refusing to accept that I have lodged a complaint.  The New Zealand Vice Chancellor's Committee chooses to pay Chris Whelan several hundred thousand dollars per year in order to say that he has never received or progressed any complaints of serious wrongdoing since he took up that position in office.  He simply denies that he has recieved any complaints at all.  The Judges choose to re-appoint retired judges rather than appointing new judges.  That means to say that the people who are paid to employ judges are unwilling or unable to do the job for which they are paid.  The judges are then put to work refusing to accept filings, refusing to schedule hearings, refusing to accept evidence, refusing to acknowledge half the laws (the ones that confer duties or responsibilities on the Universities).  This cannot claim to be the developed world.  This cannot claim to be the free world.  This cannot claim to be rule by law.  There is nothing here.</p>

    <p>Una Jagose and David Parker refuse to instruct Crown Law to Prosecute the Universities for keeping false records, misuse of official documents etc.  They refuse to do it.  They tell me that I am required to take them to the civil courts because New Zealand will not prosecute wrongdoing.  Jacinda Ardern, Judith Collins (in her capacity as leader of opposition), Chris Hipkins (in his capacity as Ministser of Education) refuse to use whatever discretion they may have to instruct somebody to prosecute.  Meredith Connell is the Monopoly firm in Central Auckland who claims to be conflicted out of prosecuting, often, because they also function as a private firm and various people have placed a dollar in their pocket so that they cannot be prosecuted in Central Auckland.   </p>

    <p>The Supreme Court of New Zealand has ruled that it is not a matter of public interest that the Universities are not processing applications properly (that is to say according to the Education and Training Act), not getting work to externals or getting it to externals with instructions it be examined for the wrong qualification etc.  It is not a matter of public interest that the NZVCC is refusing to process complaints of serious wrongdoing.  Apparently it is not a matter of public interest how it is that the Public Universities of New Zealand are choosing what students to enrol (or not enrol) in Medicine (for example), or whether they will be graduated or not on the basis of internationally accepted standards (rather than giving qualifications to the children of the administration and withholding graduation from maybe even 1/3rd of the class so as to get them 'working' in the hospitals while paying the university paying the university paying the university to be enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled in the MBChB Degree).  Apparently I am to pay the courts more than $20,000 security for costs for the cases to be heard on appeal because everything is all very very personal and very very particular to me or about me and it isn't a matter of public interest at all says the Supreme Court of New Zealand.  </p>

    <p>In this manner they delay proceedings for another year so that the Social Security Tribunal can rule on whether people can be kept detained by the New Zealand Government (e.g., kept or held on welfare while the New Zealand Government refuses to process applications for employment or training, refuses to hire or enroll the best according to objective criterion, so as to keep some people very very poorly while the children of an elite few collect up 3x 4x 5x the FTE of everbody else when it comes to their payroll into perpeptuity (e.g., the judges 70+ after more than 40 years of government payroll while various other people are kept imprisoned or held as hostages being expected to do all of the work for none of the money whhile the government goes HAHAHHAHAHHA AND WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT??  Because these lands are not developed or functional or rule by law at all).  We don't have education and training programmes, schools, universities, hospitals, any social services.  There is nothing there. The Government is and has been too corrupt.  They take themselves to be running detention camps or prison camps up and down the land.  PReferentially hiring from overseas so that people will come here and manage the prison or slave colony.  That is how our leaders choose to govern.  Party party party.  Who wants to party party party with the administration.  There is nothing here.</p>

    <p>Where is Stuart McCutcheon?  Where did he go with his millions and millions and millions of taxpayers salary for how many years of being Vice Chancellor of the slave camp that is the University of Auckland?  How about Ashley Bloomfield?  Where did he go with his millions?  He had one job to do:  Lawful lockdown. And he couldn't  / wouldn't do it and the courts refused to provide meaningful consequences or sanctionsf or his inability and / or unwillingness to do his job. Where did he go with his millions?  We are supposed to believe  he 'voluntarily chooses' to walk away from his salary.  Who voluntarily resigns from that salary?  I'm worried about his mental  health.  Whether he's stable.  Who voluntarily chooses to walk away from more than half a million dollars per year?  Where are his sons?  He had 2 boys about the age they are when they are supposed to take up their positions as wrongful deathbringers or sexual violators at one of the Universities of New Zealand (since they can do anything anything anything anything anything they want -- at least that's how they see the courts of New Zealand treat their Daddy and so how are they supposed to learn anything different?)  Half a million dollars per year over how many years?  Do he full fee paid his sons to go to Harvard, then?  Or something else?  They were to go party party party with Faucci's sons?  Exactly how is all this supposed to go?</p>

    <p>'Our goal is to make people safe at work' by punatively going after kids who are ram-raiding etc.  The police say their job is to investigate and apprehend and prosecute.  I don't know if they think that is the order, or if the order needs to come from higher up or from the policicians.  They want to target the kids, particulrly.  Not the teachers.  The 'teachers'.  They want to be hard on crime when it comes to the children but also hard on education when it comes to the function of that being to not pay the teachers, not employ the teachers,  not enrol the teachers, not graduate teachers, not educate students, sexually abuse students, arrange for the sexual abuse of students, not prosecute offenders in the schools, not get students work out for external examination, not teach the students, fail the students, indoctrinate the students into believing that education is not for them and they are to do what their superiors say when they say because they say and suck up suck up suck up and kick down...  Once the kids realise that the game is up and they don't want to be Bart Simpsons slave becuase of who his daddy is and how Bart was picked out to have a certain position in the powerplant and all that money because of who his Daddy is...  Well...  Is being 'soft on crime' when you go after the children rather than going after those who are offending against the children?  Oh, my bad, it's when you declare children to be 'adults' to obscure and conceal the fact that New Zealand is likely one of the worst and most unsafe places to be a child in the world.  Not even trying to be a developed nation at all...  What schools?  Politicians can argue over what are valid reasons to be missing school...  How about reasons like hiring sexual offenders to indoctrinate kids into believing that they are stupid to take up positions as third class citizens or actively grooming them for gangs?  I mean...  The Universities refuse to process applications on the basis of academic merits.  It isnt' like employment opportunities go any differently.  When you treat the people like disposable garbage you can't exactly be surprised when the kiddies learn that that is how they should treat you...  Of course none of this matters when the judiciary cannot function becuase the kids of the judges (I suppose) can't function.  I guess that's because they are still waiting for their parents to die, or something.  The 70+++  year old judges who seem unwilling and or unable to uphold the law...  Not willing or able to parse it, or something.  No spiiktiy the English.  Why does the government keep declaring war on it's people?</p>

    <p>Apparently University of Auckland employees are not entering grades into the system as protest, or something. So what.  Did they ever enter grades into the system?  I think the Council or whomever would go through and over-write them in the name of 'rounding' or 'scaling' or whatever anyway -- right?  I mean, the 'finalised grades' were often different from the ones actually assigned by academics in the internal process.  And they weren't getting theses out for external examination, or even if the examiners reports were coming back, they weren't using the reports as the basis for whether they recorded on the transcript that the student had done enough for their PhD or whatever anyway.  Right?  I mean to say the University is garbage garbage garbage garbage garbage because there is no signal. They won't pass students who were supposed to be passed on academic grounds.  And they give all the positions and the qualifications to people on non-academic grounds.  The people who paid Crimson Education enough money to be handed the answers or the questions or both by people on payroll (barely) to write the exams or grade the exams or what have you by the Univesrity.  I mean to say the source of the corruption is the University itself.  The 'University'.  Who has to hire a foreigner, apparently, to take three quarters of a million dollars for herself every year, every year, every year, for as many years as she can get away with that for...  While she busily works to undermine and destroy the 'University' entirely, as best I can figure or see..  Much like the glorious Harlene Hayes refusing to graduate at least 1/3rd of the Medical Students one year (despite their having been signed off on the internships she sent them to) so they could be put to slavery in the hospitals while paying the University, paying the University, paying the University.  To roll that out to Western Australia.  To completely and utterly undermine education and employment in the region.  Prison slave and detention camps up and down the land...  Where does all the money go????  I found it!  I found it!  Waiting on the courts..  The complete and utter lack of Judiciary...  There doesn't appear to be anybody home... </p>

    <p>The Government is still refusing to supply compensation to the victims of abuse in state care.  Still refusing to do it.  Is choosing, instead, to pay people to have a yakkity yak yak yak yak about it for the next 6 months or so, while not dividing up the pot of money that was set aside for compensation (less, per victim than any other developed nation) and getting it to the victims.  Not doing it.  Refusing to do it.  The people on the government payroll to have a yakkity yak yak...  Was their payroll supposed to come from the pot that was set aside for compensation for the victims?  Was the government going to take the pot that was set aside for compensation for the victims and, instead of getting it to the victims, divide it up between government employees to have a yakkity yak yak yak about how everything is sooooo hard they can only work under conditions of lateness and the courts could take take take take take from tht pot, too, in the name of court costs and legal fees.  Was that the cunning plan of how it is that New Zealand is going to refuse to compensate the victims, refuse to compensate the victims, refuse to compensate the victims.  The injustices working only to compound and magnify injustices.  The embodiment of injustice.  The right honorable injustices 'working' only to prevent and prohibit justice.  Like the prevention and prohibition of education.  The prevention and prohibition of social developoment.  The ministry of the promotion and promulgation of ill health sickness and disease.  The 'perverse incentives' only that is the active intelligence (so to speak) the motivating driving force or desire or goal or reason to be the lowest of the lowest of the lowest how low can we go?  Apparently in the name of serving Dawkins Selfish Genes.  I mean, once God is declared to be dead (the Godless heathens) then who do they serve?  They don't have the capacity to apprehand or comprehend such ideals as health or justice or education or.... So they choose to slave for their own selfish genes.  Themselves.  What do they care if the entire world goes to hell so long as their nasty brutish and short life is their legacy.  Or something.  Yay them.  Well done.  Good job.  What universities?  What schools?  What hospitals?  Nothing..  NOthing nothing nothing at all...  Corruption.  Corruption up and down the land.  Party party party with the selifish.  There's nothign here..  Why would Jacinda think that her Father has access to Cancer Care?  Why would she think that...  It really doesn't make any sense at all...</p>

    <p>I mean, I am trying to think of what more the Governments could be doing in their aim or goal or purpose or quest to create terrorist threats.  How could they be going about prosecuting or persecuting the people more than they are already?  What could they do to up the ante on the situation?  I mean...  I'm trying to be really really very very clever here.  What could they be brain storming in their yakkity yak yak yakkity yak yak sessions?  What ideas could they have...  THeir complete and utter refusal to appoint judges willing and able to uphold justice within the laws in a timely fashion...  No justice for the people.  The main offender being the Governmetn and Government employees...  What more could the Government do in declaring war on the people?  Most of the private businesses went out of business.  Those that remain are not really private businesses, at all.  They are bankrolled by the Government.  All the 'private sector' the private sector law firms and so on.  Defending the Government against the people.  Still waiting on the University of Auckland answering my Official INformation Act Inquiry to know how much they chose to bankroll Bell Gully to defend their right to refuse to apply the algorithm they published for the purposes of accountailtiy to applications to Medicine in 2018 and again in 2019.  They are refusing to process applications according to criterion they published.  Refusing to enrol students.  There is nothing there.  I wonder if Bell Gully Lawyers work Pro Bono because otherwise the 'University' of Auckland will simply refuse to acknowledge that they were an enrolled Law Student, there.  Refuse to acknowledge they graduated law school, there.  Will..  I don't know... Lock them up with Brian Tamaki (worst terrorist threat to the governmetn ever -- yeah right) and arrange for them to be suicided.  Or die of natural causes at the ripe old age of 20 or similar.  There's nobody home...  Nothing there...  What a f*cking farce of a hoax of a scam...</p>

    <p>The Education and Training Act states that, in New Zealand, people are entitled to a free Secondary Education until they are 20.  Then they are eligible to have their application processed for Tertiary Education once they have attained the age of 20 years.  But what happens is that the Universities fill up the 'training programmes' with teenagers (who have not attained the age of 20 years) mostly so that the Government can record levels of debt against the studnets name.  They enrol them in University courses of the University's choosing (not the students choosing) and, often, put them to work in the name of 'training' while refusing to examine the work properly and refusing to keep accurate records of their progression through training, refusing to give them the Degrees for the Qualifications they did the work for, refusing to graduate them.  So that they can replace the 'workers' with more 'students' who pay the University and pay the university and pay the university while the Government keeps false records about them being indentured servants etc etc only.  Quite the scummy scummy scam.  What Edcuation system?  There isn't any such think as 'earning entry' to University Education for teenagers.  There isn't any University.  It isn't Adult Education for Adults.  It is a detention or slave camp for teenagers.  They aren't processing the applications from adults properly.  They are arranging for traffickign of teenagers for sexual offences, and the like.  There's nothing there...  AUT enrolled a 14 year old Vietnamese student in a finance degree, apparently.  She came to NZ with her 'guardian' and by the seems of it they actually say she graduated before she was deported.  Visa expired, or similar.  But there are many more cases of people being deported without ever recieving their qualification.  I don't know if the Vietnamese Government ever recognised her finance degree from AUT.  I don't know what actual skills or knowledge she managed to learn (even in spite of them or despite them).  No idea.  Maybe they were just trying to train her to be a terrorist bomber against New Zealand Universities and / or the New Zealand Government.  NO idea what the f*cking plan was.  Nobody home.  Not much thinking going on.  That's for f*cking sure.</p>
