                            <p>
                                <a href="https://kellyroe.github.io/writing/realmecv.pdf">Chronological CV</a>
                                There is a link to my CV that I have presently under consideration for various things.
                             </p>

                             <p>I will try not to do  anything to break the links.</p>

                             <p>I file re-formatting my work from previous formats.  Previous formats will be replaced.</p>

                             <p>I am also attempting to simplify my cv by turning individual pieces (some of which weren't previously available) into collections such as:</p>

                             <p><a href="./publish/2003-rep.pdf">Roe, (2003).  Collected Essays and Conference Proceedings for 2003.</a></p>

                             <p><a href="./publish/2006-rep.pdf">Roe, (2006).  Collected Essays and Conference Proceedings for 2006.</a></p>

                              <p><a href="./publish/2007-rep.pdf">Roe, (2007).  Collected Conference Proceedings for 2007.</a></p>

                             <p><a href="./publish/2008-rep.pdf">Roe, (2008).  Collected Essays in Cognitive Neuropsychology for 2008.</a></p>

                             <p>
                              <a href="./writing/ks.png">Here is an example of an email from Kim Sterelny.</a> 

                              I collated the 'few small chunks' as he refers to them, here:
                              </p> 

                                <p><a href="./publish/2013-rep.pdf">Roe, (2013).  A few small chunks for 2013.</a>
                                </p>

                                <p>It is basically a re-write of my thesis topic, especially for him.  You can see how I referenced him in the middle chunk, particularly.  That was his cue to send me emails telling me what I should take out and what I should put in.  I suppose that's how it is done?  Sterelny says, Sterelny, thinks, Sterelny believes.  Sterelny can tell me what my original contribution is allowed to be.  He can give it to me and I can copy-paste it into a thesis?  When?  For how many years am I to give him work, or how any years am I to do work for the University (present material at conferences etc) before they bundle it up and get it out to externals for external examination?  What University?</p>

                                <p>BEFORE I LEFT AUSTRALIA I sent him this: <a href="./writing\doctoral.pdf"> Over 100,000 words of doctoral thesis.</a> He gave me NO COMMENTS on it.  NO FEEDBACK.  AND HE WOULD NOT SEND IT OUT TO EXTERNALS.  Years later I get my student records from the ANU and there is  note from him asserting that I sent him 50,000 words (only) and it should be done in 3 months (therefore 3 months more money for the Philosophy Programme for keeping me re-enrolled so he gets more money for pretending to supervise me).  If he wanted to see 50,000 words from me (only) he should have asked for my words in 2006.  If he wanted 100,000 words (only) he should have asked for my words as at end of 2007.</p>

<p>I did not see any of the ANU students with reports from external examiners.  I did not see any ANU students give a public oral defence of their thesis in response to the reports from external examiners.  Public oral defences should have been publically advertised.  I simply don't believe that various people had public oral defences without my knowing about them.
</p>

<p>How are other students claiming to have PhD's from the ANU?  I don't understand.  </p>

        <p>What Universities?  </p>

        <p>Dark ages.  There's nothing there. </p>

        <p>Various people wanted to be University academics so they could eat lunch with their friends.  How's academia suiting you, Jacinda Ardern?  How is your book coming along?  That's pretty fabulous how they are paying you to write them a book.  They aren't paying you for already having written a book.  I can understand why various kids parents are going to pay Harvard a bunch of money so their kids can go to Harvard and be taught by you.  What will you teach them?  What it's like to be totalitarian dictator of NZL?  Help them get the laws changed so they can come to NZL and breed knock-out babies to populate their underground bunker of their bolt hole?  Just call it a NZL government institution initiative, or similar.  So much for University.  Ffs.</p>
