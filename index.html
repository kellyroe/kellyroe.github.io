			<h1>Kelly Alexandra Roe</h1>

		<p>Last updated:  YYYY-MM-DD:  2025-12-15.</p>
		
		<p>I set up this website in the context of learning how to use .html to get .pdf content publically viewable on the internet.</p>

		<p>I was also learning about things like versioning control.</p>

		<p>- I did not intending to build or ship software.</p>

		<p>- I intended the focus to be on the content displayed rather than the source code (e.g., the .PDF rather than .tex files)</p>

		<p>As such, I have built a website over there: <a href="https://kellyroe.org">https://kellyroe.org</a></p>

		<p>I have also deleted the 'publish' folder on this site.</p>

		<p>If you find yourself with a broken link (e.g., https://kellyroe.github.io/publish/readme.pdf) then try the corresponding link (e.g., https://kellyroe.org/publish/readme.pdf)</p>
