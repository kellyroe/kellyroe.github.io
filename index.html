			<h3>Hello World!</h3>
			<p>I found my way here from Khan Academy when I was trying to figure out how to make my academic research in philosophy publicly available to a wide variety of university administrators and prospective employers.  It can be difficult for arts / social science people to get credit for work they have done when they are required to hand it over to supervisors or publishers and wait on them to decide what (if anything) to do with it.  To be fair, I suppose it may be similar to presenting work to the patient office hoping that they choose to acknowledge your submission.  </p>		
			
			<p>At the time I started posting here I did not really understand that GitHub was a place for sharing computer programming code, specifically.  I am not a computer programmer or coder, and so thought it was more appropriate for me to migrate my content to: http://kellyroe.org.  My .tex source files are, from a coding point of view, degenerate versions of the publicly available templates from whence they came.  Any value that has been added is not to be found in the code.  My content has likely already been fed into the AI programmes.  You are welcome. </p>
			
			<p>I am in the process of sorting out my metadata on Zenodo and other platforms such that the hyperlinks in my cv etc resolve to not GitHub servers.  I will then see if I can have my GitHub account deleted.  I did not mean to misuse this platform.  I did learn a lot from posting things here, for a time, and it was a stepping stone for me to set up my own website that is not on this platform.   </p>
			
			<p>Thanks to the coding community for helping academics like me not have to hand write and snail mail everything.  Thanks also for the people who do great work porting computer games and fixing them up so that they can be played the way the creators intended with respect to ironing out bugs and improving textures etc.</p>
			 
			<h3>Goodbye Github!</h3>
