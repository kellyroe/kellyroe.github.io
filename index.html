Or do the 'apprentices' have levels of debt recorded against their name, with the Inland Revenue Department?  The Government is paying the training provider to keep them as hostages.  Prisoners.  Detainees.  Slaves.  They aren't paid minimum wage for the work that they do -- are they?  Are they paid minimum wage?  How many decades are they supposed to do their 'apprenticeship'  before they are graduated from their qualifications so that they can go into their minimum wage paying jobs?  What education and training system?  You don't pay the workers.  You pay the slavers to keep slaves.  How are they unemployed when they don't make minimum wage for the work that they do?  What workforce? What economy?  </p>
