                                <a href="https://kellyroe.github.io/writing/realmecv.pdf">Chronological CV</a>
                                There is a link to my CV that I have presently under consideration for various things.
                             </p>

                             <p>I will try not to do  anything to break the links while I update contents.  I am in the process of file re-formatting and reorganising my work. </p>

                             <p>Have I done enough for a PhD?  How many years is it supposed to take, again?  Before they, you know, they pay you.  We are supposed to believe that Jacinda Ardern gets honorary qualifications and honorary fellowships becuase she's going to write a book one day (after completing a 3 year undergraduate degree from Waikato) whereas I haven't done enough?  We are supposed to believe that Ashley Bloomfield gets appointed to Professor of Public Health when he never applied to do a M.D or PhD, never did the work for one.  He doesn't have any research output.  What Universities?  There doesn't seem to be anything there.</p>

                             <p>
                              https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/504035/student-hunger-bad-teachers-revealed-in-latest-pisa-tests-showing-dip-in-nz-teens-scores  New Zealand students don't care about studying or working hard.  Because they don't pay you, they don't pay you, they won't pay you, they won't pay you.  They won't let you sit the exams, but even if you did they wouldn't grade them properly.  They won't graduate people who have done the work.  They won't even process applications to enrol.  There's  nothing there ffs.  They aren't even trying to be fair, at all.   
                             </p>

                             <p>Oh it's sooooo competitive, to get into Medical School, in New Zealand.  It's really competitive entry on the basis of GPA (not even a little bit).  They will not process the applications.  There's nothing there.  Nobody home.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  Dr Leeks was the only game in town.  Everybody else's application was thrown away.  Everything it is that we value.  There's nothing there.  What health system?  It's sooooo competitive!  How many people (sorry, `people') can we kill today?  </p>
