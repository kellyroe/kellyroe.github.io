 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>'Dr' Ashley Bloomfield is 'Dr' in virtue of graduating from MBChB (Medicine).  The Univerities of New Zealand are giving the bulk of the training places to 18 and 19 year olds (they maintain they have the discretion to choose to do this and the Courts have upheld their freedom to do anything include disccriminate against applicants on basis of race or income or post-code or secondary school or disability).  Ashley Bloomfield did not apply to study for PhD.  He does not have PhD.  I don't think he tutored or did laboratory demonstrations.  I don't think he wrote research publications.  I don't think he did any teaching or any research.  I'm not entirely sure how he went from MBChB to a 1 or 2 year Masters Degree (or how many months of enrolment they recorded his research project as having taken) but he went from there to Wellington and worked his way up the Government as a civil servant.  
                                </p> 

                                <p>AUT is apparently wanting to fire people on staff because it says they aren't teaching or researching enough.  The problem isnt' that they aren't teching or researching enough to be made Professor...  They aren't teaching or researching enough to be employees of the University, at all.  Meanwhile, Ashley gets made Professor for all the teaching and research work that he does not do.  On the basis of no teaching experience and on teh basis of no publications, at all.</p> 

                                <p>Did they publically advertise the Professor position that they have given to him?  HOw many applications did they get for the position?  Was he really teh most qualfied applicant for that job?  Did they not receive a single application from anybody with a PhD?  Not a single application from anybody with publication?  Not a single application from anybody with any teaching experience?  Did they then re-advertise the job to make sure that international candidates knew we were looking for a Univesrity of AUckland Professor?  In case other countries are still handing out PhDs when we don't seem to want to do that anymore because we dont' have any jobs for our graduates because all our jobs to to people who never graduated.  What f*cking nonsense.</p>

                                <p>The High Court Judges have declared that there is nothing to stop the Universities of NZ from enrolling whoever they want for whatever arbitrary reasons they want.  That includes them throwing away applicaitons on the grounds that the applicant is a race they don't like or whatever.  Including if the applicant is the victim of abuse in state care and they think the applicant would make a better victim than a perpetrator).  And with that knowledge we are supposed to believe that Otago has become the most desirable location in the whole world for people to go to to get the cheapest Medical Education in the English Speaking World so they have more money left over to donate to the University in the hope of buying good-will or something, one can only suppose.  New Zealand of course the best place to do experimentation on infants since we recently just changed the laws so that nobody will be profescuted for wrongful death or murder involving anything to do with a foetus.  Also, nobody was ever prosecuted before.  So it doesn't actually matter what any of the laws are.</p>

                                <p>I used to think that I would donate my inheritance to a University.  To provide a scholarship to a future student.  But there aren't any universities, by the seems of it.  The scholarship money doesn't get to the kids, it gets stolen or taken by teh administration and mis-spent.  The University throws away applications on arbitrary grounds.  Refuses to supply applicatons so that certain people are the only game in town.  We didn't have anybody with a PhD or any teaching experience to make Professor.  How many applicants were there for the Professorship recently given to Ashley?  The lengths they have to go to in order to try and make it look like he's the only f*cking game in town.</p>

                                <p>Of course it's a joke.  The Universities don't want me donating anything at all to them.  They decided that they would just take everything from me until I wouldn't have anything left to them to take.  They would just take all my research work and give me no credit whatsoever at all. It was somehow going to be more lucrative for them to refuse to allow me to apply for scholarshihps, even (well, they could just take the scholarships for themselves that I applied for or to), they would take my research proposals and, well, may as well just swap out my name for theirs and take all of the money for that for them too.  Hey, I know, let's get her slaving for the courts, then.  SHe can be instructed to file and refile and refile and refile and refile so the Judges can assert and reassert and reassert the Unviersities power to do anything anything anything they like with complete and utter imunity.  They dont' have to follow the Eudcation and Training Act.  They don't have to follow the Bill of Rights.  They can just exterminate people all voluntary-like.  Round them up for their shots (vaccine or euthanasia it's all the same).  No people.  I can't see any people.  Can you?  They can't publically advertise training or employment.  They can't assess people on the basis of the merits with respect to the things they are supposed to be selecting for (with respect to their published selection criterion).  How is NOT HAVING A PHD PART OF THE SELECTION CRITERION FOR PROFESSOR?  What a f*cking farce.</p>

                                <p>The hierarchical people think that people are like chickens.  That is or means to say you spend your entire life peck peck peck peck pecking and the frienemy who is one place higher than you in the pecking order.  Then you peck that guy to death, or dismemberment.  Incapacitation.  That guy gives up the will to live.  So then you get to take that guys place and peck peck peck peck peck at your freienemy one above. Then they get the chickens all pecking aroudn in circles. The great circle-jerk or what have you.  Wasting time.  Well, now, here's a better idea.  You get a group of monkeys together and you all throw rocks at one of them.  You decide which one of them to eliminate.  So now it's about politicking getting everybody all motivated and inspired to throw rocks at one guy.  So now the guy could be teh top guy, even.  Because the mob.  Biggest mob wins or something like that.  Anyway.  The whole poitn or purpose is that the people don't udnerstand equality.  They don't want to live amongst equals.  They want to live amongst animals where everything is sooooooooooo competitive.  Sooooooooo competitive.  Sooooooooooo competitive.  And where you are justified in kick kick kick kick kicking down because they are all pecking up.  They are pecking at you..  They are your lackeys.  Your job is to weaken them and keep them kicked back and down.  So that they can't peck quite so hard at you.  What a wonderful way to spend our lives.  Right?  How..  Uh..  Motivating and inspiring...</p>

                                <p>Some people are bullied and excluded because they are disabled.  They appear different or are differnet in some way that makes other people feel uncomfortable. And when something makes you feel uncomfortble then some people respond to that by thinking the best thing they can do it eliminate it.  Remove it.  Remove the source of their uncomfort in that way.  Other people are bullied and excluded..  Because.  Just because.  Doesn't matter why.  Because others are getting away with it.  That makes them winners in the great competititon of life game, apparently.  The aim or the goal or the idea or the point is to incapacitate disable and elminate as many people as possible.  THe losers at or of life.  That's what that means.  I mean...  In a war environmetn if I pluck your eyes out then I win.  You lose.  If I cut your ears off and you can't hear then I win.  You lose.  If you can't walk and I can.  I win.  You lose.  If I can have it recorded that you are disabled then you have been incapacitated.  You lose.  I win.  The High Court has ruled that the Univerities of New Zealand can throw away applicatons to enrol for whatever reasons they like.  Now think about reasons. Including because they think that a person might speak out about abuse in state care (rather than wanting to partake in or of it).  INcluding because they think that people might have compassion or empathy for the weak rather than thinking that they most desire to exploit them.  INcludilng thinking that the heatlh system is about anything other than weakening sickening disabling incpacitaing and generally going aroudn declaring much of everybody else to be losers of the great life game. </p>

                                <p>The government seems to think that their primay purpose or point is in fact to declare war against the people.  I mean to say..  Ashley Bloomfield was the only person who applied to be Professor?  Really?  Was teh job even publically advertised?  How many other applicants were there?  HOw many applicants had their applications thrown away only because they were obviously more qualified and better suited to Professorship than he?  There is really no hint of 'try' so far as I can see...  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  I used to think that I would donate my inheritance to a University.  To a scholarsip of some variety.  Something like that.  But they are too corrupt.  Also, (actually part of the corruption) they don't need or want any donation whatsoever from me.  They decided that they would just take me for everything that I have completely totally and utterly so I'd have nothing to give.  I mean..  For how many years am I expected to work towards qualifications that I've done enough to have earned years and years and f*cking years ago?  Meanwhile people who didn't do the work for them get made Profesor?  They won't pay me for the work that I do.  Then they throw me to  be slave to the courts.  So they, now, can take everything I have.  Just take everything.  Take take take take take.  The courts just take.  Identify peopel to take and take and take and take from.  Persecute the victims (jump on the victim bandwagon of taking everything just taking everything just taking and taking and taking) and declaring over and over and over there is no justice.  There is no education . There is no healthcare.  There isn't anything here.  </p>

                                <p>They won't supply applications to enrol but even if they do they throw the applications away.  They won't process the applicaitons according to the merits  but even if they do they won't select the best person for the postion (when they have published criteiron as to how they are supposed to decide the best person -- they just won't do it).  They won't enrol or employ the best person (according to their published criterion).  They intentionally choose to pay and pay and pay people who don't have the willingness and / or ability to do the actual f*cking job descsritpion or to complete the actual f*cking progarmme of study.  They don't wnat it done, anyway.  The point is to get people working only to ensure it isn't ever done.  No justice.  No healthcare.  No supervising research.  No teaching curriculum contents.  And the main point or pupose is to get all the money to peple witout the willingness and ability (all and only those working towards the prevention and prohibition of anything at all programme) and to starve out anybod with teh actual willingness and / or ability.  There's nothing here.  There's nothing here.  There's nothing here.  </p>

                                <p>The Judge ruled that the governmetn doesn't need people to actually apply to programmes in order to record that they have actully been enrolled in programmes.  So, now, how many people are the govenrment going to enrol in the Right Honorable Sir Dr Ashley Bloomfield PhD MBChB MD JD BS qualification?  Headed by someone without a PhD who doesn't have any teaching experience or any research output?  HOw much money are they going to pay him each and every year to ensure that no teaching is to be done.  No research is to be done.  However many people will be identified as peopel who will have course fees invoiced to their studnet loan (endentured servants of the governmetn with debts only to be recorded against their name).  Not a university,  hey.  Not even trying to be. </p>

                                <p>Line up line up line up!  Ashley's got a list of people due for their shots!!</p>

                                <p>There isn't anyting to do but document their crimes document their crimes document their crimes document their crimes document their crimes.  There isn't any acadmeic research output.  Document thehir crimes.  Document their crimes.  There isn't any teching curriculum contents.  What curriculum contents?  Trying to have the people score as low as possible on international examinations.  Document their crimes documetn their crimes document their crimes.  The examinations don't matter.  Ashley never submitted a doctoral thesis for external examination.  Document their crimes document their crimes. What Univesrities?  Slave.  Prison.  Forced labor.  Detention camps. INdoctronating people 'I'm soooooo lucky I'm a gamma baby I don't have to work half as hard as Ashley!!'  Document their crimes.  Document their crimes.  There's f*cking nothing there.  What ecomony?  Is Australia still going on about changing their constitution so as to explicitly mention that Aboriginal people are people?  So they seem to know what the process is, for changing tehir constitution.  They seem to think that enough people don't vote or that enough people who do vote a racist enough so that they will never get the number they need to result in constitution change.  I mean to say that the whole idea is likely one designed to tell Aboriginal people that Australians don't actually think that Aborinal people are people.  Note even Aboriginal people.  But then Australia won't supply voting papers.  It is actually written in Australia's constitution that NZ is a state of Australia.  But they are full or excuses and reasons why that doesn't matter.  Why they can treat NZ as an offshore detention camp of Australia.  Refuse to supply people born in NZ with Australian birth certificates.  Passports.  Refuse to supply Australian wages.  Throwing away their applications, now.  The Austrlaian National University.  Throwing away applications from New Zealanders because they are from New Zealand.  Refusing to graduate NZ students, primarily.  Refusing to process applicaitons for employment.  Traficking in slaves.</p>

                                <p>There isnt' anyting to work for or to.  They seem to want to declare war on the people.  Mass herd people into extermination camps (abusing people in state care etc).  Will not pay the workers.  Will not acknowledge work that has been done.  Won't supply references for when work has been done.  Won't process applications.  There's nobody home.  Nothing there.  They aren't even trying to be a land of freedom, equality, or justice.  They aren't even trying at all.</p>

                                <p>So...  I'm trying to understand, here.  We are supposed to believe that some lady from the US decides they want to study Medicine (MBChB) at the University of Otago, apparently or allegedly, because it is the cheapest place they could find, in the English Speaking world.  That means that they will have some 'extra money' that they can give to the University.  Not as a  bribe, of course, but more a gesture of good will, or someting.  I don't know.  Now...  She can't enrol in the First Year Health Science programme of study.  That's what they told me.  They said that you had to be a 'school leaver' as in the next year after your left High School.  I think they said no gap year.  They also said that you couldn't do First Year at Auckland and then go do First Year at Otago.  They expected the direction to be the reverse.  School Leavers go to Otago.  Then, if you don't get specially chosen to be the next Dr Leeks you can head up to Auckland and do First Year up there.  Anyway..  So she donates a bunch of money to the University of Otago..  And they can't think of a better use of the funds than to arrange an advertising or marketing campaign to the High School kids to try and motivate and incentivise them to want to study Genetics.   Because, clearly, the problem, the reason, why New Zealand does not have more developed genetics research is because nobody from High School applies to study Genetics at University.  If only they had have heard the speel from the advertising marketers the University would get more and more applications to study Genetics.  Because they don't have more applications than available places in the programme already.  But more particularly, they don't have the *right* people applying.  But that's strange, since teh courts ruled that they don't need people to even apply in order for them to have them enrolled in that Degree.  So...  Maybe the idea is to motivate and incentivise the kids to do anyting anything *anything* in order to get to study genetics. Perhaps that is more the idea/l.</p>

                                <p>They seem to *want* me to document tehir crimes,  hey.  I mean, they just keep displaying their crimes.  Keep displaying their crimes.  Keep displaying their crimes.  Keep portraying their crimes.  Keep displaying their crimes.  Refusing to process applications.  Refusing to employ competent people.  Refusing to pay the workers.  No money to pay the workers by the time They've paid off various people to do their crimes.  What a f*cking insult to all the New Zealanders whose applications you throw away.  Throw them away.  Throw them away.  Throw them away.  Give all the training places to foreigners.  Give lots of the lucrative governmetn jobs.  COuldn't find enough New Zealanders unwilling and unable to do research and teaching had to pay various foreigners hundreds of thousands of dollars to not to that so as not to upset some kind of social order they believe they are entitled to.  How much did the Dean of Research at Waikato get paid?  She reckons she doubled the size of the research school.  Know how they did it?  More than double-billed the student enrolments.  It's soooo competitive!  Soooooo many studnets!  Sooooo competitive.  Soooooo competititve.  Sooooooo competiteive.  We don't have enough students!  We have too many students!  The students are too white too yellow too black.  Do think too thick too intelligent.  The students are unacceptable!  Unacceptable!  WE dont' have enough we have too much it's soooooo competieitve.  Nonsense nonsense nonsense garbage garbage garbage.  Wehre does the money go?  HOw's that working?  So motivated and incentivised by the research output...  The alumni journal.  The publications...  No?  The slave detention camp of waste everybodies f*cking time-land.  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>Waikto is supposed to have the best Computer Science programme in NZ.  But teh Univesrity lacks the willingness or ability to keep accurate student records.  Go figure.  The corruption...  The corruption.  The corruption.  Quarter of a million was it, for hte University of Nottingham graduate to be Dean of the Research School of Social Science.  So she can keep a trophy room of theses she refused to get to externals.  Keep a tropy room of thesese the externals woudl have signed off on except she refused to get them teh sign off papers.  Quarter of a million for her to keep false records of reenrolmetn nd reenrolmetn and reenrolemnt.  F*cking psychopth.  Kay Weaver.  F*cking Psychopath.  Alllll of the money for Kay.  Alllll of the money for Kay.  How many weeks for 120 points of study?  What does the Univesrity have to deliver doing the bare minimum here?  For how many weeks does the University need to provide teaching and study periods (with access to computer rooms and library etc) and residnetial halls being open during the academic year?  HOw many weeks is the academic year?  What is the  bare f*cking minimum you offer your students for 120 points of funding fees you get paid to deliver 120 points of teaching / research?  What's the bare f*cking minimum?  YOu know all about the bare f*cking minimum when it comes to closing the residential halls and not paying contractors to teach or research any weeks outside the bare minimum.  So that sets the deliverables for graduate student research work.  You f*cking psychopaths.</p>

                                <p>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/already-under-fire-politically-three-waters-is-also-threatened-by-nzs-critical-shortage-of-skilled-engineers/MGYBCAULANDKJO3DVZ7EY5EFJ4/ Hey, it's okay.  You can just pay Ashley to do it.  Just give him the job.  No need to publically advertise it.  No  need to allow people to submit applications for it.  No need to employ anybody to do it at all.  Just say that you gave the job to Ashley and then maybe even don't pay Ashley.  He can just pop it down on his CV for his next deployment.  Whatever job you want to record as 'it's okay we don't need to recruit or grauate anybody from that 'training programe' (wink wink nudge nudge) we'll just pay Ashley not to see it done.  To see it not done'.  No need for skilled laborers or workers at all.  No need for graduation.  No needt o record enrolments (don't worry the courts say you can keep recording enrolments and reenrollments on the basis of whatver you like including whatever qualification you think people may be genetically entitled to).  You don't actually have to pay them anything . And they don't actually do anything.  Not the developed world, at all.</p>

                                <p>Really?  We cry cry cry cry crying about Engineering again?  Well, just pull nanogirl out.  She was paid?  She paid you?  HOw much to 'motivate and inspire' a generation of girls to *want* to be engineers.  Because the problem before was that no girls *wanted* to be engineers.  Then, once girls started *wanting* to be engineers because of Nanogirl or perhaps because of exposure to forign things...  Then you could get busy busy busy refusing to process their applicaitons, refusing to enrol them, refusing to graduate them and so on.  Because the problem is nobody wants to do it.  The problem is too many people want to do it.  The problem is the wrong people want to do it.  How do you decide the rignt and wrong people?  Simple.  The right people lpay the univerity.  The wrong people expect teh unviesrity to pay tehm for the work that they did on their qulaificationk.  HOw much money does a f*cking piece of paper cost?  It is not about the money!!!!  Nasty little despote.  That's what it's f*cking well about.  Alll of the... Attention?  Was it?  For nanogirl.  I wanna smash things it's sooooo fun to smash things...  Pick me pick me pick me to be the next nanogirl?  Or I'll..  Uh.. Dye my hair to work (without  a face mask) in teh South African who trained in England to be New Zealander of the Year's biology lab.  Will I?  How motivating and inspiring and incentivising.  Yeah, right.</p>

                                <p>Pick me!  Pick me!! Pick me!!! For all the qualities that it is that you value!  The reasons why you picked Kit Toogood to be reappointed as Judge.  To be doing 'independent' investigations or inquires into the deaths of Mason and Olivia when they were in state care.  When people were employed by the Governemnt to look after their welfare.  When tehy died in state care.  Pick me!  Pick me!  Pick me!  For all the qualities that it is that you value.  Dr Leeks.  All the people he chose to sign off on.  All the people who closed ranks about him to cover up.  Pick me!  Pick me! Pick me!  Pick me for the unlawful drugging by the governmetn employees programme.  The professor glue factory for the people sent off to the glue factory all voluntary-like.  Anybody who sticks their hands up for psychiatry or mental health assistnce is a legitimate target.  Right?  To be put out of their misery. To be victimised further still by the people the governmetn chooses to incapacitate them.  Pick me pick me pick me!  To cover up the crimes of the f*cking psychopathic idiot inbred children of the elites who were too busy being psychopaths to invest in their children's humanity.  Pick me!  Pick me!  Pick me!</p>

                                <p>Don't f*cking pick me.  I don't give a f*ck who you pick.  DO YOUR JOB.  DO YOUR JOB.  DO TEH F*CKING JOB FOR WHICH YOU ARE PAID OR WALK AWAY FROM THE MONEY.  JUST F*CKING WALK AWAY.  DO YOUR JOB.  PROCESS THE F*CKING APPLICATION ACCORDING TO TEH CRITERION YOU PUBLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF YOUR ACCOUNTABILITY.  F*cking psychopaths.  Refusing to do the job for which they are supposed to be paid.</p>

                                <p>Jacinda Ardern informed the graduating class of Harvard that abortion had been legalised in NZ.  I don't know what qualifications were graduating (if they graduate different qualifications on different days) but if people saw that aspect of her speech...  The thing about abortion being legalised..  Well, first thing they would notice is that even though it was only recently legalised on her watch nobody had ever been prosecuted for having performed one.  In other words, she went to the USA and gave a speech (that would have been viewable to Americans more widely) about how wrongful death of foetus in NZ is not really considered a problem.  They can easily look from there into how NZ is about the worst place in teh world in which to be a child.  Our rates of bullying and abuse and so on.  Also about how these occur in state care and the government works to close ranks around and protect abusers.  Now NZ is quite teh destination for all the people who wan to abuse with immunity for their crimes!  It is particularly desirable for genetics research.  See, what you do is you harvest eggs and collect sperm in the name of fertility treatment.  You mess with that.  Creat your 'designer baby'.  Choose which embryos...</p>

                                <p>You are supposed to destroy them or freeze them or implant them by however many days after fertilisation.  Maybe 14.  I think that's it.  You aren't allowed to grow them in...  I don't know..  Kiri Allen's Uterus.  For example.  Hook the uterus up to blood transfusion equipmetn and see if you can get a baby growing in utero.  In the uterus you have pre-harvested from someone all voluntary-like they just hnded it to you (likely in the name of them needing cancer surgery else voluntarily choosing sex reassignment).  Anyway...  Then the issue is how you collect your designer baby.  After it's been growing in the uterus for however long...  You want ot see what specific and particular deficits or defects it has now that you have knocked out certain chromosomes or genes or cross bred it with a monkey to create an entire underclass slave class or whatever it is that you decided to do with it...  So the harvesting...  You want them to go into state care so you can keep special eyes on them.  Record the precise nature of the deficit or defect.  I would imagine.  I suppose that mothers kept in institutions would be a target for this sort of treatment.  Particularly if it is easy to implant into them in the name of operations or what have you.  Then another operation to collect.  I mean..  Why wouldn't you?  Why wouldn't you if you are getting away with it?  Where would you go in the world to do such things?  Can you think of a better plce to go do such things than New Zealand?   I can't!  Can you?  </p>

                                <p>So..  That's a thing to do with the designer babies.  The knock out babies.  In the name of genetics research.  They say it's about discovering cures for what ails people.  But they are going about causing or inficting disease is what they are doing.  Let's be honest bout that.  Let's be clear.  What would the jury say?  Oh, no new jury trials in the name of and because of Covid.  I bet.  I'm sure.  Of course.  And all of the people who want to pay or buy their way into Medical School or employment iwth the DHB's or the Governmetn of NZ, now, pay the government pay teh governmetn pay teh government pay the government.  HOw much money will you pay the government for your edu-tourism helpling me helping me helping me help myself to you funsies campaign?  SO we understand why there aren't any places for anybody else.  Cry cry cry cry there never will be enough to go around.  Cry cry cry cry cry.  </p>

                                <p>I mean, didn't you know?  How many people  needed to be specially bred in order to be thrown to the psychoapths?  That's the only thing between teh psychopaths and you.  There is no alternative.  This is the only game in town.  Do you have a problem with that?  Tell it to Professor Glue's Glue Factory.  Do we have psychiatary in the private sector, then?  Do we?  I really and truly do not think that we do.  I mean to say, the problem is not that there aren't enoguh psychiatrists..  The problem is that there aren't allowed to be any psychiatrists.  The problem is that they get search nd destroyed.  Gone.  Done.  Bye bye.  INstead of psychiatrists we get Professor Glue's Glue Factory.  What's the idea/l?  It doesn't matter what you do to the bottom however many percent of the worst of the chronic underclass never going to recover worst of society.  That's what it is or meanas to have psych care in NZ -- right?  Who wants psych care?  Put your hands up!!! Never stop asking for help.  So we can record who asksk for help.  Target on your head.  Target on your head.  Target on your head.  Helpling me helping me helpling me help myself to you.  HOrse tranquiliser.  LSD.  Old generation antipsychotics (known to induce parkinsons and parkinsons like symptoms).  Kuru.  Feeding virus infected rabbits organs to rabbits over and over and over.  And then who knows what goes into the prison and hospital food in the 'closed wards' (not open to visitors).  The food contract is not the same.  How do we get such high rates of kuru prion diseases in Australasia?  I beleive it is not through lack of effort...  How do i KNow.  What is the best reason that you can think of for why they REFUSE TO PROCESS MY APPLIACTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CRITEIRON THAT THEY PUBLSIHED FOR THE PURPOSES OF THEIR OWN ACCOUNTABILITY.  THey are not being held accountable.  They are not being held accountale.</p>

                                <p>Therefore nobody can function.  Hostages.  Hostages to the f*cking psychopaths.</p>

                                <p>It isn't plausible to think tht people get drugs and so on into prisons and institutions despite the government workers.  It is more plausible that the governemtn workers are unlawfully drugging the people held in prison.  Clearly.  Right?  F*cking obvious.  What's the f*cking end game, here?  How many people need to be kept in institutions and murdered in institutions for Ashley to feel sufficienetly good about himself.  Etc?  I really can't f*cking well comprehend...</p>
