 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->

                            <article>

                                <p>
                                    https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/130843473/babys-mystery-death-inspires-mums-move-to-nz-to-study-health-science  Wow.  I, uh, just cannot comprehend this, to be honest.  Was the decision to choose Otago (the cheapest place in the world for maximum 'donation') one that was made before or after the High Court Judgement proclaiming that the Univesrity of Otago could throw away or enrol whichever studnets it wants in MBChB for whatever arbitrary reasons it wants?  I mean to say, there is nothing at all wrong with Andrea Howard and Peter Crampton and Bryan Hyland and anybody else who has the opportunity to do so, simply throwing applications away?  Conversely, there is nothing to stop them (as they have  been doing in fact) choosing to enrol people in MBChB from 'alternative' category or criterion when those people have never studied at University at all.
                                </p>

                                <p>I used to think that I would leave my inheritance to the University in the form of a scholarship.  But then the Government and the Univesrities decided that they would rather keep me poorly so the idea or thought of my having any inheritance to leave was a joke.  I mean, they will never pay me for the work that I do.  Right?  I can just slave slave slave for the Uniesrity for how many decades on what, now?  And then slave and slave and slave for the courts.  So they can pay judges into their retirement to not see any problems.  To not see any problems at all.  The government will just take all the money.  So.  Anyway...  The trouble with teh Univesrity of Otago is what reason does anybody have ot believe that there is any honesty or any integrity there, at all?  I don't see any.  Do you? The recent court judgement is that they are entitled to be racist and sexist and whatever they like.  Throw away applications from whomever they like.  Enrol whomever they like.  University of Auckland wants to hire professors, now, who never even studied for PhD.  Who have no teaching experience.  NO grading experience.  Apparently they have all the experience that is needed or important to be Professors at a research university and they never even studied for PhD.  All the qualities it is that we value.  I suppose the whole idea or intention is to be a magnet for people to bring foreign money to New Zealand.  Since the international studnet fees ar ethe cheapeset of any english speaking nation (to the best of my knowledge) that leaves more money to just hand over to the Univesrity.  Not bribes, exactly.  Buying good will?  What good will?  What honesty?  What integrity?  New Zealand is the destination, now, for the abortionists and genetic researchers of the USA who are afraid they will be charged with murder if they keep on with certain practices around removing fetal tissue and organs and so on.  Experimenting with RSV.  It is differnet from Covid.  A different type of virus.  They will be wanting to bundle it with MMR if they can.  So that the highly trained nurses from Samoa can get busy mixing it with expired anasthetic to result in wrongful death so that the little elite white babies can be the only ones in town. No?  Oh, I'm sorry, have we figured out how we are going to not allow that to happen anymore?  Or have we chosen to embrace that and plot to how we can roll it out more widely?</p>


                                <p>'Doctor' Ashley Bloomfield was a 'doctor' in virtue of being a graduate of MBChB (Medicine).  Medicine, in New Zealand, is primarily an undergraduate qualification where teenagers are expediated into the qualification when they are 18 and 19.  So that they can become, uh, 'enculturated', shall we say.  By the likes of Dr Leeks.  They aren't processing the applications according to the criterion they publish for the purposes of accountability.  THey are hand-picking people for the qualities that they value.  I don't know why Dr Ashley Bloomfield does not practice Medicine with his Medical Degree and his 'Doctor' title.  I don't know why he is paid more by the Government to work as a civil servant (not to see patients) and why they now think it is a good idea to pass him off as a PhD graduate (which he is not) and grant him a Professorship at a 'Univesrity'.</p>

                                <p>I guess it's like the primary and secondary schools that have 'teachers' 'working' in them where the 'teachers' don't have their qualifications and they don't pay them.  Ashley is like that, I guess.  He doesn't have a PhD and they dont' actually pay him to be Professor because he doesn't have his PhD.  Any more than the secondary school teachers who are having their secondary school teaching qualifications withheld by the University are paid.  Once you've done enough for your qualification you are supposed to lie flat.  Die already.  They'll get people who didn't do the work for hte qualification pretending to do the skilled work unpaid for free.  Eh, Ashley?  Why pay professors when you can just do all of the..  What do you do?  Put on a fancy gown and ponce about during graduation ceremonies?  Who wouldn't wnant the government to be invoicing the IRD for having enrolled them in a qualification with ashley for a photoshop opportunity to get a snap of you spitting in his face, or something?  </p>

                                <p>What a big 'f*ck you' slap in the face to all the people at the University who the University simply refuses to get their work to external examiners so that they don't acknowledge they have done a PhD (e.g., Angela the co-ordinator from MEDSCI142 they won't get her work out to extaminers so as to prevent her getting a Phd for all the work that she has done over how many decades in Medical Education?)  Instead they choose to grant Professorships to people without PhD.  What an interesting career-trajectory.  He hasn't tutored at Univesrity, hasn't lectured at University, hasn't been publishing or focused on publishing for University, hasn't been involved in University at all.  And nown he's given a Professor title that most Professors in New Zealand aren't given until they are junior lecturers and associate lecturers and so on.</p>

                                <p>Actually, thinking about the current head of Psychiatry at Auckland.  The guy trained in OBGYN in Spain or Portugal.  I forget.  I am sure there must be an interesting story as to how you go from being OBGYN in a land far far far away to...  Being enrolled in a PhD with the Uniersity of Otago under Professor Glue.  Only to be graduated in a somewhat timely fashion and positioned relatively swiftly to be about the only Psychiatry Professor to the Univesrity of Auckland.  Not sure how recent the hire was.  If it was before or after the case of the Chinese international student who was detainedin the Grafton Psychiatric Hospital in breech of her visa conditions so that she could be deported without receiving etiher of her double degrees after having been raped in a residential hall.  Was he involved in her detention and breech of visa conditions to justify her being deported?  Or was he appointed afterwards once there was an outcry about the University being a scummy scummy scam being run by someone who trained in how to prepare the sheep for maximum profits before starving them each and every year (the gist of McCutcheon's PhD from Massey in animal husbandry)?</p>

                                <p>Process my application.  It isn't that 'there is no alternative' to Dr Leeks and the like.  Professor Glue's Professional Glue Factory (get it lol -- some people somewhere will think it's funnny of the chortle chortle snort variety).  Drugging people into being quiet or, failing that, ensuring that Junior Doctors murder them into being quiet in that way.  I would imagine the case of the Junior Doctor who was suppling party drugs to party teenagers in Otago (who killed one of them), well, where was he sourcing the drugs from?  So...  The University of Auckland has some kind of lisence or allowance to manufacture LSD now?  So they can give that (all voluntary-like, after having informed them, I'm sure) to people..  Maybe people kept detained in the secure ward of the Grafton Psychiatry place (where there are no external visitors to bear witness to what is going on).  Why would you do that?  To have them believe they are psychotic, I would suppose.</p>

                                <p>Gaslighting.  Give someone a hallucinagen but don't tell them that you did.  Then when they start to say that they feel peculiar or strange or are seeing things or hearing things then you explain to them that they are psychotic.  They don't have the ability right now to make good decisiosn on their own behalf so they will just have to trust you that you will decide for them.  If they won't do it voluntarily then you can get a court order and get things done in that way.  Right?  So seem to say the courts.</p>

                                <p>My Medical Books (USMLE United States Medical Lisencing Examination material) say that people live really rather surprisingly well with all kinds of congenital heart conditions or defects.  That is or means to say that there are quite a few cases of people not knowing that someone even had a heart defect or deficit until they are older in life.  Maybe in their 20's and they get a check up.  Something like that.  Sometimes you do hear of people dropping dead after sudden exertion when they have never really exercised before.  They say that's becuase they had a heart problem that nobody knew of or about.  So, there is often little urgency in fixing congenital problems of the heart.  In fact, because the heart (also the valves and the vessles) are growing it is hard to know if things will right themselves over time.  The Court was supposed to rule in the best interests of the child.  But the Court did not hear evidence from or information from any medical professional to atttest to reasons why it might not be in the best interests of the child either not to have the operation, to have the operation later rather than sooner, so have the operation with blood the mother felt was more appropriate for her child.  The Court thought that what the New Zealand team decided was the only expert Medical opinion that the courts would listen to.</p>

                                <p>People die from not having the medical interventions they need and also want quite a lot of the time.  Wah wah wah there never will be enough to go around.  We are too busy forcing treatment on people who don't want it.  Only treat the involutnary.  </p>

                                <p>There should be international concern (because domestic no work-y) about the incubator baby situation in New Zealand.  Think how the kids used to be raised in the Russian Orphanages in ye olden days.  New Zealand aspiring to be like that, I mean to say.  The observational studies that were done in failure to thrive and failure to flourish in kids kept in Governmetn Institutions.  Giving women steroids induces premature delivery.  They tell the women that they are going to have a premature delivery so they best take steroids so they help the lungs mature to benefit the premature infant.  But the steroids themselves induce premature delivery.  So they get to keep the baby in an incubator.  Separating it from the Mother.  Insterrupting and disrupting the attachment.  They can get I don't know how much money from the Government for keeping the baby in the hospital.  Then they can call various things congenital or birth defects when the baby is under-cooked.  So to speak.  They can hook it up to venitillators.  That would be concerning because blasting virus infected or bacteria infected air (e.g., by not properly sterlising the equippment) might be an interesting observational study, from the perspective of some minds.  I would imagine that you could induce rheumatic fever in infnts like that.  Or maybe test out experimental vaccines.  Things like that.  I would imagine it would be relatively easy to...  What reason do we have to believe that these sorts or kinds of things are not happening?  Most people are trusting.  Most people don't realise how psychopathic some other people actually are.  The stories they tell themselves about sacrificing a few in order to save the many.  They think they are heroes.  </p>

                                <p>So, the kid was an incubator baby.  One thing that can happen is that the infant filial imprints on or attaches to hospital staff rather than the Mother.  And of course the hospital gets more and more and more and more money from the Government for each and every night that the hospital bills the Government for having and keeping the infant in state care.</p>

                                <p>new Zealand hasn't given the victims of abuse in state care their payouts yet.  Can't do / won't do.  But still busy busy busy ordering people to be placed in state care.  Can't clean it up.  Won't clean it up.  Dr Leeks.  There is no alternative.  All the other applicants had their applications thrown away.  Professor Glue.  There was no alternative.  Giving horse tranqulisser sourced from vet science or surgical anasthetics in the name of psychiatric treatment.  LSD in the name of psychiatric treatment.  The Professor Glue Professional Glue Factory instead of Psychiatry.  The prevention and prohibintion of the developmetn of psychiatry progrmme. There was no alterative.  Nobody else applied for that job.  They threw all their applications away.  The current PRofessor at Auckland.  To head the secure unit in Grafton?  The one with the different food contract to the rest of hte hosptial?  The one that doesn't keep medication charts to people being held under the mental health act?  The one that makes unlawful use of seclusion (according to Ombudsman's reports)?  The one that doesn't allow visitors on the ward?  That one?  We had to hire from overseas because nobody from NZ wants to be a psychiatrist.  Nobody applies to Medical School.  Nobody graduates from Medical School.  Nobody applies to do Psychiatry.  Dr Leeks is the only game in town.  </p>

                                <p>Process my application...  Hurry up.  You can appoint Ashley Bloomfield MBChB with a...  Was that a 120 point research masters?  Was that a 2 year masters with 1 year of course work and 1 year of research?  Was that a decade long Masters? Was that a 'terminal masters' to terminate your academia?  You were booted out of the university with your highest level degree being a masters level degree.  So that you don't get to supervise PhD level students.  It's where academics go to die.  Isnt' it?  Enrolling in a Masters level degree...  Hospice of academia.  To be detained indefinately...  Why won't the Univesrity of Auckland get Angela's work out for external examinatin?  Who in their right mind could possibly think that she has not done enough for a PhD in Education for the academic work that she has in fact done in Medical Education?  </p>

                                <p>What University?  They won't employ Professors.  But then they can't seem to process applciations to enrol, progressions though trining, or qualification completions.  And now Ministry workers are going to be redeployed as Professors to censor (one can only imagine) their army of unpaid student slave workers?  Is that the idea/l?</p>

                                <p>'A new health system can't fix what is broken in society'.  Indeed.  But you also know what?  Fixing what is broken in society...  Wouldn't fix the health system.  Don't worry.  Squiggley's got it Squiggley fixed.  It starts by not processing teh application to enrol, recording enrollment in things not applied for or to.  Hoarding work rather than examining it.  Sending it out to be examined for qualification sthat were not the ones that the student applied to.  Stabotage undermining.  The lenghts they go to to ensure Ddr Leeks is the only game in town.</p>

                                <p>Justice Toogood (Kit Toogood) is very concerning.  It is very concerning to me.  What is in a name?  Not a lot...  Except that other people don't seem to see it that way.  I am not sure why.  Maybe because in some part of the world criminals are re-deployed with a little conversation like this 'this is your new identity.  This is your new passport, this is you new deployment position (along with your new qualifications) off you go to New Zealand.  That's how we get 'Professor Glue' of the people Glue Factory that is Psychiatry in New Zealand.  How 'Dawn Freshwater' who apparently trained as a Mental Health Nurse gets re-deployed to be VC of the University of Auckland (after Stuart McCutcheon's trying to run it like a sheep station of the South ISland forcing however many deaths by starvation each and every winter after cry cry crying for more and more and more money otherwise however many hostages would die every winter)...</p>

                                <p>Dawn Freshwater is the kind of name that you choose for yourself when you are trying to run away from something.  Domestic abuse in the past.  Or something...  Or the kind of name that people choose to give to you when tehy choose to re-deploy you.  Redeploy you to do what?  To completely undermine the University of Auckland?  TO close down the 'tertiary education' facade in New Zealand?  I mean they can't even process applicaitont to enrol.  Trying to breed the next Dr Leeks...  Enculture the 18 year olds...</p>

                                <p>Kit Toogood is concerning.  He is how old?  I do believe he was retired from being a High Court Justice or Judge.  There is some age wehre that is supposed to happen.  That makes  sense (the retirement age) when you think that the generation of which he is of were scuttled into lucrative high paid government positions when they were very young, indeed.  His father was Selwyn Toogood.  As in, 'It's in the bag with Justice Toogood'?  'The money or the bag'.  Kind of a thing.  Now, that's not his fault, of course.  But I mean to say, I don't know who his Daddy was that he was allowed...  Allowed to be such a prominent public figure in New Zealnd socieity.  This was aroudn the time when there was 1 television channel around the time of the news...  The public image of the Toogood name.  I mean to say.  Anyway...  Kit gets his law degree from NZ and even gets shipped to Yale.  Yale? Was it?  For one of those 'high value' 2 year Masters that they do.  Not a J.D., He didn't go to Law School in the USA.  He did a 2 year Masters over there then came back to NZ and I don't know what..  And then he's appointed Judge of the HIgh COurt.  ANd goes on to have a very lucrative and upstading career for...  40 years of payroll was it?  Until he retires at the age the judges are supposed to (after having been appointed around the age the judges are supposed to).</p>

                                <p>And then instead of appointing new judges by way of the process they are supposed to be appointed...  They decide to keep Justice Toogood on payroll allegedly to deal with the increase in cases due to Covid Lockdown.  Which is, of course, absurd.  Since there is no increase in cases due to Covid Lockdown because Covid Lockdown means no new jury trials or cases will be initiated.  So tht lightens the case load of the courts, in fact, that they aren't having any new jury cases for a while.  So it should actually give them the opportunity to clear their backlog.</p>

                                <p>So Kit Toogood...  Gets appointed to hear 'Roe v University of Waikato'.  When he's not supposed to be judge.  He isnt' there because of any proper process.  THey kept him on (when he should have been retired)...  Because..  Well, let me guess...  What are you going to do?  Try and have him removed from office??  LMFAO!!!!  We can do anytyhing anything anything anything.  Well, Justice Kit Toogood can.  Right?  What's the maximum penalty?  He's supposed to be retired / removed from office already!  But he's still there!!  Over his dead body -- right?  Justice Kit Toogood was commissioned to write the 'independent' report saying that he didn't see anything wrong with Mason Pendrous' death.  Saying in the report that it wouldn't really do to go after Mason Pendrous' character (that he was interacting with friends online and was a computer science type) which was raising issues of his character (in a 'dont think about organges' or 'don't think about smoking freely free smoking' kind of way).  He intentionally did not get his internet records from the Universitiy (that would have been supplying the hall) to pinpoint his time of death / when the internet activity stopped.  He did not interview his friends as to...  Why...  who may have had reason to murder him.  I would suppose or imagine.  Because university is soooooooooo competitive.  Right?  And some people's children go out of their way to collect up all kinds of trophies (underwear is only one kind of trophy, I would suppose).</p>

                                <p>And now Justice Toogood has been appointed to do an independent inquiry on cycling NZ.  It is strange that Olivia would voluntarily choose to kill herself all voluntary like just as peple were seeming to start to listen enoguh to investigate what was going on / wrong within cycling NZ.  Odd time to up and kill yourself.  They are saying that handing over evidnece is differnet now.  Better now.  It is not.  It is not better in fact.  The medical records (the government medical records) are not being handed over in a timely fashion in an attempt to prevent and prohibit people from bringing timely cases against the government for abuses in state care.  Justice Toogood obviously plays the role of protecting or closing ranks about the government.  He doesn't appear to have anything to lose.  I mean, quite kamakazee in how he can is or will go about it.  Right?  What is the alternative?  Retirement for him.  What does retirement mean for or to him?  ISn't the source of his power and authority the role that he plays for the governmetn in doing these things?  If he was properly retired...  Put out to pasture..  That would be a death sentence for him.  Right?  Do they even pay him or does he volunteer his time?  How many dependents does he have?  What does he spend his money on...</p>

                                <p>Does Ashley get a free house like Dawn Freshwater was supposed to?  He's gone from half a million per year to, what does he make as professor?  Quarter of a million?  But I guess his sons have left home now?  Where did they go?  Are they still dependent?  HOw much money does Ashley pay them in child support for them to keep up the lifestyle they all believe they are entitlted to?  His wife is independently employed by teh Government so she's okay, I think...  But two sons...  Are they going to go party party pary in Dunedin?  Trophy hunting?  Or is Ashley such the servant of the people that his children need to be shipped off overseas because it's not safe for them to remain here, or similar...  Quite the trophies they would be?  What other perks does he get?  Honorary PhD?  Are they going to give him an Honorary PhD before they make him professor?  Curiouser and curiouser...</p>

                                <p>Where are Justice Toogood's sons?  What are they doing now?  I am genuinely curious.  SInce Daddy gets to do anything anything anything anything...  </p>

                                <p>Bryan Hyland.  Head of Physiology at Otago.  Him and Peter Crampton and Andrea Howard admitted to withholding applications to enrol so that people couldn't apply.  All 3 of them admitted to throwing away applications to enrol so that the applications would not be presented to the medical admissions committee so that that person could not possibly be selected.  All 3 of these people admitted to having done that in fact.  Peter Crampton went to far as to say that his position on the Medical Admissions Committee meant that he had the power to make decisions on their behalf when the committee was not in meeting.  That is or means to say he was personally able to hand pick who gets sent offers of enrolment in Medicine quite independentnly of anything decided by the committee during such time as the committee was in meeting.  The High Court found that yes.  Peter Crampton could do anyting he liked.  But he liked to try and distribute responsibility to Andrea Howard and Bryan Hyland, too.  Andrea Howard was then re-deplooyed to throw away applications to deal with the rabbit problem in the South Island.  Because they like the inumane and inhumane way they are going about trying to breed biological weapons feeding contaminated rabbit organs to rabbits (and who knows what goes on with the prison and hospital food contracts in the places where the wards have no visitors).</p>

                                <p>Crampton is redeployed to processing applications to work in teh Dunedin Hospital.  So they can try and find the next Dr leeks..  The next junior doctor to feed people horse trnquliiser and LSD and surgical anasthetic in the name of psychiatry treatmetn.  If they threaten to speak out then even going so far as to eliminate them entirely.  Hyland...  Well..  It's an interesting and distinctive last name.  I did see that there was a medical student in Sydney with last name Hyland who was befor ethe ocurts over there several times for beating on his girlfriend.  I don't know if that was Hyland's son.  I don't know...</p>

                                <p>Not exactly the developed world.  Hey.</p>

                                <p>No justice.  Health.  Education.  Value.  Meaning.  Purpose.  Goal.  No people.  Nothing to see.  I wonder who will find that the IRD records that they have debt to the NZ Government because the NZ Government chose them to be enrolled in Sir Right Honorable Dr Ashley Bloomfield M.D, PhD, J.D, B.S Professor's school of forcing people to take their shots only when they don't want to in the name of because I'm getting away with it hahahahahaha what are you going to do about it? 'Degree' with the 'University'?  Let me guess it's soooooooooooooo competitive.  Best get busy breeding yourselves an entire tribe, 'people', so that of 10, or 20 of them can be sacrified for the 'public good' in psychopath-land.</p>

                                <p>Given that the lockdown was unlawful (and the courts chose to pronounce that that was okay because we don't think the leaders of NZ need to follow the laws)..  Actually...  THe lawyer who took that..  Borrow-forward.  He was a PhD student when he took that case to the court.  I asked him for how many years he'd been working on his PhD...  Whether they were planning on giving him a J.D for his actual filing work...  Whether he had been working on his PhD (filing in the courts without being paid as a lawyer???  Not sure if his filing with the court taking Ashley to court was unpaid slave work associated with the PhD or what..)  Anyway...  He now is saying he's a PhD in Law.  The piont is that he did not take the case through the Court of appeal.  That is or means to say he failed to establish that there would be consequences for the Attorney General of Health to be held accountable by the Courts for making orders that were unlawful.  Wow.  That's quite the victory of medical abuses being given the a okay by the courts of New Zealand.  Quite the precedent there.  It' slike they have him his PhD to NOT FILE WITH THE COURT OF APPEAL.  To ensure that the only precedent would be a terrible one.  Obviously unjust.  Obviously wrong.  But the courts can maintain some semblance of pretence by limiting the filings to the High Court only.  So they can say that the Court of Appeal would have found in the interests of Justice -- but the issue was the case never went before them.</p>

                                <p>But now the courts are simply throwing away filings.  Refusing to accept filings.  They don't semm to be wiling and or able to find in the interests of justice at all.  Quite the scummy scam.  I don't suppose it's so very surprising when Australia can't parse it's own constitution.  I mean...  The number you have to do on people..  Gaslighting....  When plain English is just blatently ignored and disregarded by the courts.  The word salad output of the courts.  The blatant rubbish and nonsense.  We are expectedt o beleive that people voluntariliy chose to get Ashley Tattooed on them.  Really?  People in prison camps got things tatooed on them.  I guess that was voluntary.  Voluntary-like.  Stockholm syndrome or somethign.  I mean...  Who thinks that...  Adoration...  Is a normal kind or sort of response to being unlawfully detained  by the government?  </p>

                                <p>Public or popluation health is basically about being a 'farmer of people'.  Managing the people-farm.  Herding the chickens.  Feeding the pigs.  That's how they think of the population they 'serve'.  Alllll of the moeny for htem.  All of the titles and the postions.  All of the fancy suits.  Without the fancy suits you would not be able to tell who the leaders were, you see.  The ones with the expensive glasses?  The governmetn will choose what dentistry and optometry is right for you...  The lengths they have to go to for a few people to feel okay about themselves.  That's the thing of it.  How insecure can they possibly be...  The extent they have to kick kick kick kick kick at everybody else.  </p>

                                <p>Where is Stuart McCutcheon?  John Key went off on a little holiday overseas at some point.  Not long after he went mad with power pulling the hair of girls in cafe's.  I wondered if he was being held in an off-shore detention camp.  Honestly.  Some photos that were taken when he was being visited by his son Max, looked like they could have been a resort...  A 'resort'...  A bit hard to say the context of the place where he was allegedly or apparently or supposed to be.  Where did Max go?  To study Medicine in France, was it?  Engineering?  Marketing?  WHo knows...  Who cares, honestly.  He wasn't trophy hunting in Dunedin and he wasn't trophy hunted, I guess.  What fun.  'Fun'.  Or something.  Just so we understand the sorts of diversions...  Why it is tha the people don't have healthcare and so on and so forth.  Education.  Anything really.  Selfish selfish selfish.  Right Sterelny?  Did you ever get your pen out or whatever it was that you needed to do in order to give me concrete instructions in writing as to what I was supposed to do for you as your student?  I'm sure you can check the records that are your email outbox for what you provided to your other students.  Rachel and Ben and Brett and so on...  All of your OTHER students.  How about the records of what you provided to me?  Because of why?  Because you just wanted to tell me about how f*cking selfish everything is and was.  Selfish selfish selfish it's in your genes.  Riiiiiiight.  Selifish selfish selfish.  Alllll of the ressearch funding for you.  Philosophy really providing the vision for the University, hey.  Selfish selfish psychopaths.  Bullying everybody else into fleeing away...</p>

                                <p>The 'Universities' are keeping false records of student enrolments.  They are recording that people are enrolled in qualifications they never applied to be enrolled in.  That way they are telling the Government they have 10 EFTS of graduate research, in the department, say, when what they are really doing is falsely re-enrolling and re-enrolling and re-enrolling studnets in programmes the students never even applied to be enrolled in.  The 'Univesrities' are also refusing to employ people willing or able to superise graduate student research.  They are intentionally employing people who will partake in this scummy scam.  Employing people who will only instruct the students to slooooooow doooooooown and change things worse and so on in order to prevent and prohibit and stabotage timely completion of the qualification.  Because the 'University' gets more and more and more money from the government for keeping the 'student' a-slaving.  The University records more and more and more EFTS of enrolment and re-enrolmetn and re-enrollment.  The University doesn't even use those records to employ people to teach them.  Instead, the University diverts the money to paying the administration hundreds of thousands of dollars to participate in this scummy scam where they refuse to get work out to externals because they want to collect more and more and more money and more and more and more EFTS for keeping the 'student' a-slaving.</p>

                                <p>Worse...  The government scholarships are not getting or going to the students.  It used to be the case that the University would publish lists of who the recipients of the government scholarships were.  The academic merit based scholarships.  yes.  Also the financial need based scholarships.  If you chose to apply for a financial need based scholarship then you were informed that your name could (likely would) be published and a bit of an article written about you for promotionl purposes.  There used to be articles written saying about how some kid from an impoverished background had been chosen recipient of a financial need based scholarship.  It was something that was supposed to help motivate and incentivise kids from impoversihed communities to work hard in school etc thinking that they might be able to earn a scholarship like that.  But we don't seem to have those scholarships anymore.  We prefer to teach the kids to go ram-raid.  There isn't any point working for anything because they wno't get your work to examiners.  But even if they did they wouldn't examine it fairly.  But even if they did they would just throw your application away.  They would just enrol you in the Bloomfield show degree and they wouldn't graduate you . But even if they did they would throw away your application for employment.  But even if you did get employed.  THey would never pay you.</p>

                                <p>They do not publish lists of scholarship recipients anymore.  They don't publish the lists of who gets the academic merit scholarships (e.g., the Masters level scholarships or the PhD level scholarships) and they don't publish information as to who is the recipient of the financial need based scholarships either.  I put in an official request for information with the Univesrity of Waikato for lists of who receipients were.  I thought it may be worth contacting the receipents to see if they actually received the money they were supposed to or if the University was diverting the money.  I mean to say, I thikn that the Univesriteis are not paying the students the government scholarships.  I don't know if it is corruption that they are intentionally using the money to pay the VC half a million.  Or if it is more about keeping the studnets impoverished and deprived.  Maybe both.  Possibly only the latter.  Or maybe all of the above. I don't know.  ANyway, the Univesrity refused to supply me with the infromation.  They say that it would be violating privacy and shaming to financial needs based applicants.  But I think what they are doing in fact is collecting up information from people who apply for hte financial need based scholasrhips and using that information to identify targets for ill treatment nd so on.  The fact that people apply for a scholarship on the basis of financial need means that the Univesrity targets those studnets for deprivation and over-billing and the like.  because it thinks that those studnets will be powerless in the face of them choosing to do that.</p>

                                <p>The Waikato District Health Board said that they offered $5,000 scholarship for or to a studnet who was working on a project in line with tehir published research priorities.  I applied to it in 2018.  A project on 'disability and equity in medicine and public health'.  I did not get the scholarship.  I can't imagine that they would have had too many people at the University of Waikato working on a 1 year research masters in a topic in line with the hospital research units research prorities.  There is not a close relationship between the University of Waikato and the Waikato Hospital (Auckland 'University' allegedly sends 'medical students' there).  They told me that the receipent of the research award was a psychology student who enrolled in a 240 point masters so did coursework in 2018 and would have written their 1 year masters research project in psychology in 2019.  I asked them the name of the project.  I was interested in seeing it.  Mostly, I am interested in whether the $5,000 actually went to the student.  I am also very interested in the enrolmetn duration of the 120 point research aspect of the studnets masters that they wrote for the DHB.  I am very very interested in whether they got the students work to externals.  Whether they told the student they needed to keep working (for decades more even) else they would never give them the qualification.  I am interested in what that student is doing now...  E.g., if they proceeded to PhD or to a government job as an entry level advisor or analyst...  If they were bullied into handing over their work and fleeing the Univesrity entirely.  Whether the studnet was an international studnet or domestic etc.</p>

                                <p>I think it most likely that the reason why they are not publishing lists of scholarship recipients is becuas ethey are not getting the money to students, at all.  So...  Wehre does the money go?  Do they give it back to the Government?  SO the governmetn can say 'we are going to provide however many millions of rsearch funding for students' and the money just never goes out the door?  Or does the University take all or some of it?  Perhaps they collude and take a chunk each.  I guess that's how the...  Corruption...  Goes.  Right?  How is this not the direct transfer or hand-over of, effectively, suitcases full of money?  In these modern days of bank trnsfer, I mean to say.</p>

                                <p>If I am wrong it would be fairly easy to prove that by supplying the list.  It used to be that the list was made publically available.  I remember you could read who the receipients of the FASS Masters Research Awards were.  They would say 'anybody with a B+ average or higher was guaranteed one'.  But that some people with B or even B- may end up with one becuase the government supplied a certain number of them and they assigned them on the basis of GPA since they were academic merit based scholarships.  But now the Univesrity says they make the decisions about who gets them on the 'quality of the research proposal' so that I (for example) with a GPA in excess of A miss out because they say the Univesrity decided that my research proposal was garbage.  But other students with GPA as low as B- got those scholarships.  That is what they told me.</p>

                                <p>So...  Is it that they are treating me as very very special.  I mean to say they pick me out for particularly specially bad treatment.  Throwing my applications away and so on when they are treating other people fairly...  Or is the unfair treatment more systematic than that?  Well...  I wonder if they simply tell ALL the applicants that they were garage garbage garbage garbage garbage and the scholarship selection committee splits up some or other share of the money amongst themselves?  I think that Justine Kingsbury was given some kind of promotion after I was declined from having a Masters Scholarship.  I wonder if the value of her promotion was the value of the Masters scholarship, or something else?  I mean to say I wonder if, in fact, the Univesrity sets up 'competitive' situations like that where the only academics they hire (sorry, 'academics') are ones who agree to take their studnets work and fail their studnets out in order to pass off the work as their own (or hand it to other people to do that).  With respect to starving the studnets out (withhholding research funding) I guess that depends on information they have bout the finncial position of the studnet.  Some studnets are bullied into handing over more than $5,000 (the value of the scholarship) to 'university editing services'.  They tell the studnets that they can be failed in fact if they find so much as a single typographical error.  If they dont' want to risk the University choosing to use their discretion to do that then they best just hand over $5,000 to Univesrity editing services...  Etc.  Not really a Univesrity, hey...</p>

                                <p>They are keeping false transcripts.  Because they are keeping false enrolmetn records.  They are keeping false course codes.  They are enrolling students in course codes that don't appear in their University Calender, even.  I don't know if the course code was approved by the Tertiary Education Commission.  I don't see how it can or could  be because the TEC says that 120 points is 34 weeks.  That means to say if the University doesn't hire teachign staff to cover 34 weeks of work (including the examination period) the University is under-delivering a 120 point programme of study.  The flip side to that is that the University cannotn accuse a research studnet of under-delivery when teh student tries to complete 120 poitns of research in the 'minimum normal or standard time' which is set by the Tertiary Education Commission as 34 weeks.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                                <p>What is it for an 'outcome of examination' to be 'based in' reports of the external examiners?  If the external examiners say that changes to the substance are required before the thesis is to be accepted and the student changes the substance and the university refuses to accept the thesis..  Is the universities refusal to accept the thesis based in the reports of the examiners?  You would say, well, it dependds if the changes to the substance were the ones required by the examiners.  Or whether enough changes to the substance had been done.  So then...  The changes to the substance need to go back to the examiners so that the examiners can see and decide whether or not the thesis is now to  be accepted?  So when the University refuses to get the substantively updated thesis back to externals beause they are demanding 6 months additional enrolmelnt and 6 months additional labor that is based in the reports of the examiners, is it?  No.  It is a decision that takes the power away from the examienrs.  Refusing to get the work to the examiners and allowing the examiners to say whether or not enough work has been done for a 120 point qualification.  I applied to START on 05 March 2018.  I submitted a thesis for examination on 14 September 2018.  The Uni refused to get it to examiners.  They had one f*ckign job to do.  Over-bill for keeping me re-enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled.  Yeah.  Not a 'university, hey.</p>

                                <p>I get them a thesis 05 October 2018.  They send it out for 'doctoral examination'.  Doctoral examination is up to 100,000 words 360 point programem of study.  But I wrote them a 120 point under 50,000 words project.  They were trying to force examiners to say that insofar as it was acceptable changes to the substance would  be required (doubling in length) and re-enrolment.  They pretended to be too f*ckign stupid to send the masters thesis out for extenral examination.  They had one job to do.  Not a 'university'.  Hey.</p>

                                <p>The examiners reports 'doctoral reports' of the masters thesis...  Said that changes to the substance would be required before it would be acceptable.  I changed the substance in ways they directed keeping it under 50,000 words beause I wasn't enrolled in a PhD.  The Univesrity thinks they can choose to force studnets to labor for a PhD and only give them Masters credit.</p>

                                <p>The Univesrity thinks that if your grades are good enough to go directly to PhD after your Honors year then you do that.  Otherwise you are stupid.  You lose.  Because you were supposed to grub for the salary ASAP.  Realising that the people on payroll already didn't actually know much in the way of anything and weren't very bright either you were supposed to grubby grub grub your way up there to join them ASAP.  So then you enrol in the 3 year phd.  They tell you 'ooooooooh i'im sooooooo scared for you that you will fail oooooooooh best take out extension and extension and extension ooooooh i'm so scaired for you yuo will faill!!!'  and you best pay more than $5,000 to 'university editing services' to check it for typos.  And so on.  And then after 4 years of work (the Phd is 3 years extendible to 4) they will take 1 year to externally examine it...  They will send you letters saying that you arent' enrolled and they can't examine it without your being enrolled.  You will have to pay them more fees for more enrolment.  No more scholarships.  Pay more fees or walk away.</p>

                                <p>Hmm..  So then, maybe you were supopsed to submit it after 3 years even if they closed the ressearch school down for the day (just locked the doors and nobody home nobody to accept the courier delivery) even when your supervisor was having a screaming tantrum about how you better not submit it because you will fail...  And then they take a year to examine it...  And they have some kind of party party party...  And, I don't konw...  Decide whether they think you will make a quality addition to their team of collecting up as much money from as many studnets as you can get and getting them to give as much time nd money to the university as you can get away with...  </p>

                                <p>So very motivating and inspiring,  hey.</p>

                                <p>It isnt' because the Univesrity of Waikato is second tier or anyting like that.  I mean to say the Australian National Univesrity chose to hire Kim Sterelny because of the way they wanted the University to do.  THey make the hiring decisiosn that they make becuse of what it is that they value, one can only suppose.  I imagine that he did offer supervision to his other students.  Pretty sure that he did.  He seemed to think that my job as his studnet was to beg and bow and scrape to him, though...  I mean...  I think he asked me to meet with him once or twice...  But I don't think he used that time to ask me what I was reading or to say that he wanted me to read something and get him a summary by a certin date.  He certainly never told me any date at all that he wanted to see any of my work by.  I did send him things at times...  Did I get comments back from him on any of it?  I think maybe once I did.  Comments about ideas that occurred to him in response to things I had said...  I mean...  What did he want me to do with those comments?  What if any changes to the writing needed to happen?  Whose job is it to do what, now?  I wrote and I wrote and I wrote..  ANd insofar as supervisoin went what did he do?  Who collected up all the money?  For how many years?  And now the Austrlaian Natioanl University is refusing to process applciations to enrol.  Won't do it.</p>

                                <p>Not that many years ago the Uniersity of Queensland had an inquiry into how the VC of the Univesrity allowed his daughter to be given enrolmetn in Medicine on 'equity int eh  name of leadership' grounds when he had not applied for equity consideration on the grounds of being a leader.  I mean to say, her grades and UMAT were not sufficient for her to get an academic merit place so they gave her a place anyway anad said that it was justified as she was an equity candidate.  He ended up resigning for having done that.   But no attempt to identify the person whose place she stole (an equity candidate) was made.  NO reparation for the victims.  But of course that's not the only victim.  Apparently his daughter was given the qualification.  What is she up to now?  HOw many people wrongful death on her hands?  And then all the people the equity candidate may have been able to help who don't get he help they need.  You can't get an accurate handle on teh financial and social costs of the corruption.</p>

                                <p>But that didnt' signify the start of greater accountability from the Universities.  It seemed to signify the start of a demise.  The courts did not properly find in the interests of justice, I mean so say.  And the other universiteis, sorry 'universities' went' 'meeeeeee toooooo' 'we want to be just as corrupt as the University of Queensland'.  So now the other Univerirsities of Australasia (includign the Australian Natioanl Uniesrity) are not properly processing applicaitons to enrol, are not hiring people willing and or able to supervise graduate student researchy, are not getting students work to externl examiners...  Not even trying ot have 'universities'.  Selfish psychopaths.  So says the philosophy programme or department.  I can't do medicine (or graduate from philosophy!  wow!!) because of the selfish psychopaths.  Dawkins selfish genes and all that and alll of the philosophy research funding to Sterelny and his selfish genes.  Or the zombie army of New York or similar.  I mean, Professor Martin Davies can't even write a reference for his summer scholar who meets with him as he requests, does the readings he reqeusts, does the writings he requests, gives the seminar presentation that he requests.  He won't even write them a reference.  What kind of a person doesn't give an employee a reference?  Alllll of the money for him and his selfish, I suppose...</p>

                                <p>My ANU student records actually record David Chalmers and Kim Sterelny as my supervisor at various points.  They were on payroll to do what, now?  Well, then, where it the evidence of them having supervised me?  That's what they are on payroll to do -- right?  If they aren't going to supervise the student, oh well, get out of the way, then, I suppose.  At what point was my work supposed to go to external examiners?  If the examination process takes up to 1 year then there is time for the examiners to basically do the job the supervisor/s refused to do.  Right?  I mean, did you see the examiners report of the NZ examiner for my 50,000 word thesis?  They wrote enough for me to write a 100,000 word PhD in response to everything they said!  That was what Waikato seemed to want the NZ examiner to do.  When they chose to send the Masters Thesis out for Doctoral examination.  They seeme to be telling the externls that I wanted to be re-enrolled in the PhD programme instead of being sent away with a second rate terminal masters from a second tier university (that I was only enrolled in because Auckland University lied to me saying I needed to complete it to be 'eligible' for MBChB when I was 'eligible' in virtue of being a domestic adult who applied to the programme).  </p>

                                <p>It is important that people know that teh problem in NZ is not that there aren't enough skilled and capable and talented and hardworking people etc etc here.  The problem is corruption.  There are a few elite selfish psychopths who refuse to allow other people to be credited or acknoweldged or seen or promoted or employed or whatever.  Why?  So you don't waste your time trying ot 'work your way up' once you realise that they're frienemies who would rather see you die an untimely death than live amongst equals.</p>

                                <p>When I said about them being 'stupid and not knowing very much' I mean to say that I saw that the NZ Education system maxes out at 4 years of tertiary level study.  3 levels of undergarduate.  1 level of honors that they sometimes call masters.  That was my understanding of it.  It used to be that you did a 3 year degree and if your GPA was high enough you got invited to enrol in a 4th, Honors, coursework year.  Then, if your honors grades were high enough you could enrol in PhD.  If your honors grades were not high enough you could apply to enrol in a 240 point masters programme where the first year was the honors year and the second year was a 1 year research masters.  If your honors grades were high enough you proceeded to PHD.  If your honors grades were not high enough you aplied to be enrolled in a 120 point research only masters.  You hoped that the external examiners of your 120 point research only masters would say you had done 'enough' to be re-enrolled in the PhD programme so that you might complete  3 year PhD doctoral tehsis.  Otherwise you were given your 'terminal masters' exit qualification.  no more university study.  They deemed you did not have the capacity to complete a doctoral level thesis.</p>

                                <p>But then...  The Univesrity went on and on and on and on adn on about how PhD's never got jobs.  No point getting a PhD from a NZ Univesrity because they would never ever ever ever ever ever ever employ you.  Never ever.  And in oyur PhD you were supposed to do what?  Contribute new research..  But,  uh..  THey haven't actually taught you very much, yet.  I mean to say in the US system the PhD programme is 5 years (after everybody does a 4 year undergrad programme) and the first 2 years are 2 years of graduate level coursework.  So that you have more classes of edited collections of journal aarticles adn the likek.  So that you get to learn more.  Know more.  Understand more.  So you might have something to contribute and so on...  And that's what gets people in NZ not wanting to scuttle their way to the end of a PhD that is terminal since NZ Universities don't hire NZ PhD graduates (that's what the NZ Univesrities tell people when people are considering what to enrol in).  Most people wnt the 'doctor' title.  So I guess they scuttle for that.  I don't know.  I felt that the people in teh Philsoophy Department at Waikato (not very many of them) taught me very well when I was an undergraduate.  But I had learned from them during my time there and it would be nice to get to learn from different people.  I don't know many people in the US who stay at the same institution during both undergraduate and then graduate level study.  People go to a different graduate univesrity to learn from differnt people.</p>

                                <p>So, what do you learn in Australasia going to a different univesrity for graduate level study?  Well, the PhD programme does not have any course-work.  Dave Chalmers and Kim Sterelny didn't offer graduate level courses in metaphysics or philosophy or language or philosophy of mind.  Didn't offer garduate level courses in philosophy of biology or philosophy of science or philosophy of social science.  No graduate level courses.  No readings were set.  No class discussions about readings.  No instructions to write essayas of whatever length and hand them over.  No comments on written work tht was done.  Nothing.  So, then, what's the f*cking point?  Right.  Exactly.  If Australasia wants people to wand to go there for the high quality education then how bout you actually plut your f*cking employees to actual f*cking work making them teach 2 classes per semester and having regualr meetings and so on with their garduate research studnets and so on.  WHy am I always forced to pay the costs of other people's f*ck ups.  They were on payroll to supervise and teach me.  Who is in the position of power?  Why does Australasia constantly seme to think that the laws are mechanmisms for the powerful to oppress others and healthcare is a way of wrongful deathbringing to those who have been recorded as having been incapacitated?  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                                <p>Maybe they did give Ashley an honorary PhD for all the work that he did in Medical edcuation.  The Bloomfield show etc etc.  Maybe they took him into the trophy room and asked him to pick a trophy.  Which thesis he wanted credit for.  Or maybe they didn't bother about him being first author on an academic piece.  I wonder,  now, how much money they will say that Ashley brings into the Univerity?  The goernmetn grants, I mean to say.  How much money do you think the various government ministries will give to Ashley for his 'independent contract' research work?  That's what he is now -- right?  In the postion of being able to apply for Governmetn research funding?  For all this academic publications?  All the work outputs of the people on payroll for hte misery.  I mean the ministry.  Instead of hiring ministry workers from teh university you could give all the money to ashley to keep studnet slaves doing all the work of misery officials while recording greater and greater and greater levels of debt against their name?  Is that the great plan for the prevention and prohibition of social and economic growth and developmetn of the australasian region now?  Is that the ideal?  Is it primarily the USA trying ot force everywhere else to be and go so low?  It seems to be embraced by the people here...  The main point of telling the people that abortion had been decriminalised in NZ (as part of a honorary degree from Harvard no less) was that...  Nobody has ever  been prosecuted for having performed one even though iht was criminal offence up untl recently.  New Zealadn does not have a functioning judiciary.  Quite the magnet.  Hey.  Who wnts to voluntarily move to New Zealnd?</p>

                                <p>Trying to understand it, actually.  How does it possibly work or go?  Did they publically advertise the government job?  See what applicants they got, from all around the world?  Re-advertise the position once they didn't get anybody with a PhD applying for the job.  What job?  The job they are giving to Ashley.  How could he be most qualified when it doesn't even have a PhD?  Or did they not advertise it at all?  Was it a job especially made up just for Ashley?  Is that how our government refuses to work, now?  Throw away all the other applications so that Ashley gets to have...  That's how he got into Medicine -- right?  Anybody more qualified than he had their application thrown away so that he was the only game in town. </p>

                                <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/300772448/aut-suspends-redundancies-but-sends-out-list-of-names-of-people-it-wants-gone  Yuk.  What a nasty business.  Once upon a time (when AUT was wanting to become a University because it thought it would get more money if it was a Univesrity rather than a Polytech) they hired a bunch of people who they wanted to output research so that they could say they were a proper research institution.  But, I suppose, for the most part they do not want the academics on their staff to be researching.  Why not?  Because it is easier to convince your studnets to slooooow down and not output research if they can see the people employed by the university not really researching.  I mean to say, if the Professors can tell the students that they only get 5,000 words published every 5 years, or so.  They only write a new talk for seminars or conference every couple years or so...  Then it is easier for them to persuade their students that it's impossible to do 50,000 words of research in 1 year or 34 weeks.  Or impossible to do 100,000 words of research in 2 years or 68 weeks to allow 1 year of external examination to be completed within 3 academic years (so no re-enrolment required).  But that would...  Halve?  THeir number of reserch students they get money from teh Univrsity for keeping as slaves...  More.  I would suppose. It would more than halve their number of research studnets.  Wah wah ah wah wah we don't have any research studnets.  Wah wah wah wah wah we don't have any doctors.  No medical doctors.  No PhD's.  Right Ashley?  No research output.  No teaching.  Nothing to see here, people, nothing nothing nothing at all.</p>
