                            <p> https://www.nzherald.co.nz/kahu/the-investment-into-maori-apprentices-has-turned-around-maori-unemployment-youre-hired/4NEY2WL5RNAQ5KJ2OSEYM7IZGE/  Do the apprentices get paid minimun wage for every week of their apprenticeship?  Or do the 'apprentices' have levels of debt recorded against their name, with the Inland Revenue Department, while the Government pays the 'training provider' to keep them on less than minimum wage?  How are they being kept as apprentices?  
                            </p>

                            <p>When do you think the Australian National University will get my academic work out for external examination?  I was disappointed to find that nobody was paid to supervise me.  No supervision meetings.  Nobody regularly gave me comments on my academic writing.  Nobody regularly gave me instructions to help me complete on time.  They were only interested in re re re re re enroling me.  Presumably for more and more money for the 'University'.  What 'University'?  Australia's premier research institution can't even / won't even get students work out for external examination.  Can't even / won't even employ people willing and or able to do their job and supervise their enrolled students.  Currently they say they refuse to accept that they didn't offer me supervison.  They say I have no evidence of that.  Not even trying to be a University, hey.   </p>

                            <p>I don't know if other studnets who were formally acknowledged as having done enough for PhD had their work sent out for external examination.  Firstly, I don't know if they ever recieved reports from external examiners or if the University just picked and chose and their work never went out at all.  I also think that Sterelny was likely taking work from some and crediting it to others.  He got sent a lot of work for publication in the Philosophy and Biology Journal.  It wouldn't surprise me if he was finding out who the studnets or people not on payroll were and delaying publication until they were  bullied into fleeing and then crediting other people with authorship of the work.  I wouldn't be surprised to learn that he wasn't the author of much of what he claims for himself in print.  I wouldn't be surprised to learn that his pets were given other studnets work.  I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the Australian National University was trying to pick out people most likely to go on to similarly staff prison camps around the world.  Not even trying to be a University.  Why would I want to go to University to have morning tea, afternoon tea.  Lunch.  Dinner.  Drinks.  WHERE IS MY SUPERVISION?  AT LEAST GET MY WORK OUT TO EXTERNALS IF YOU ARE TOO F*CKING STUPID OR PSYCHOPATHIC TO DO THE JOB FOR WHICH YOU ARE PAID.  There isn't anything there.</p>

                            <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/491068/lawyer-admitted-to-the-bar-despite-dishonesty-and-child-assault-convictions  Was he admitted to the bar 'despite' his offending, or was he admitted to the bar 'because of' his offending?  Was Dr Leeks employed by the government in spite of his offending, or because of his offending?  Was Kim Sterelny employed by the Australian National University because he got his studnets work out for external examination, or because he didn't?  How many doctoral theses did Carl Brusse have to write for the Australian National University to get credit for having done one?  How many times did he need to house-sit for Sterelny?  Go away with him on camping trips ffs.  For how many decades did the Australian National University claim to have kept him re re re re re re re re re enrolled?  Pooor pooor poooor Australian National University.  The problem is they don't pay Sterelny enough.  Sterelny needs a pay-rise.   </p>

                            <p>Don't worry Ministry of Education.  Using 'teachers' to grade studnets work can be unfair and discriminatory, too.  That's the point of them, isn't it?  To teach some studnets that the government expects them to take up positions as terrorist  bombers so that government leaders can go around the country passing and revoking laws under 'it's an emergency repeal the abortion laws post-haste' and people will look to leaders for comfort if only you can keep the people abused and deprived enough and turning on each other they will turn to you for comfort.  Right Jacinda?  Quite motivating and inspiring to see how the US people came together after the destruction of the twin towers.  If only there could be a arranged a more permanent state of overt war... The people would happily sit at home all day tuning into the Bloomfield show... </p>

                            <p>Australia seems to have changed the euthanasia laws.  At least, they have been advertising for people to do that as part of end life care.  I guess there were all those experiments about how people would simply follow instructions to kill someone else.  They can advertise the positions and see who will do them.  Who will be a surgeon for 'non-credit'.  Who will be a lawyer for non-credit?  See what opportunities present regarding who he can stick pins into and so on.  I wonder how the Nazi party advertised positions so that they had people happily working the death camps.  Apparently some of the employees were actually singing triumphant songs, and the like, while working those jobs.  They were having the time of their lives...  I guess you probably don't even need to pay them, then.  We could just call them apprentices, right Chris?  </p>

                            <p>It was genuinely surprising to me to learn the lengths that NZ would go to.  Refusing to process applications to enrol in Medicine.  Learning that the whole thing is a scummy scam, really.  They aren't graduating the studnets from those qualifications.  They aren't employing them to work those jobs.  What happened with that nurse..  When they got one applying for a job in New Zealand and they thought they could contact her employer overseas and have her fired or let go so that she'd have no other option but to be detained in NZ to 'work' for low to no pay...  The whole 'how low can we go' strategy or whatever you want to call it...</p>

                            <p>Is it because of cannibalism in the food chain?  Australia had this thing about the Fore people.  Observing the effects of the Australian Authorities forcing them to cannibalise each other.  They said they were doing it voluntarily, of course.  They weren't being forced to do it by the authorities.  Rather, it was culturally normal.  Kind of similar to the things Professor Glue wants to say about communal sleeping arrangements for Maaori.  We have got better, now, at being able to track Syphilis and the like.  Knowing which employees of the government passed it to who etc.  More formally documenting crimes...  So they can be most valued employees of the year.  I do wonder if it is the Kuru.  Plaques and tangles.  Neurodegenerative disease.  The leadership, I mean to say.  Those picked out to be paid and paid and paid and paid to keep prisoners or hostages or slaves or what have you.</p>

                            <p>They are making a better life for their children?  They think their children will have a glorious time being Lord of the death camps?  I don't really (I really don't) understand.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                            <p>I used to think it was over-population.  If people were scarcer we would value them more.  But now I don't think that is it.  If people were valued more that just means some would fetch even more money for them on the market so things might even get worse, if people had less babies.  That's why all the pressure from governments to keep the women popping out baby after baby after  baby to be uplifted into state care.  I suppose Nieve was actually Jacinda's baby (genetic tests could confirm) and she didn't just take someone else's and sell it off into slavery or whatever on one of her overseas trips.  Where is she now.  She's 6, right?  She going to school, then, in NZ?  How are Ashley's sons doing now?  Seems John Key is trying to get publicity for his son doing a podcast saying what a great Dad John Key was to him.  Dad wasn't telling Max to go do anything anything anything outside a nightclub on a Friday night for $5 (what Sir pony-tail puller had to say about how to get the people from NZ vaccinated).</p>

                            <p>F*cking dumb and dumber show, I swear.</p>

                            <p>Ashley focuses on his parents.   But more interestingly where are Ashley's sons?  Singing happy songs playing doctors and nurses?  Doesn't matter what laws you break so long as the court says it was justified, right, Dad?  They are picking out lawyers who like to stick pins in babies so they may make judge one day and not see anything wrong with any of this.  It's all culturally normal they say.  Who wouldn't be doing everything Dr Leeks did if only the opportunity presented itself to you.  Right?  Who wouldn't be Hitler if you had opportunity and could get away with it for a while?  If you think you wouldn't then I guess that means we get to play this little game then of seeing how badly we can treat you to prove to ourself that you would be treating me as badly as I'm treating you if only you would be getting away with it.  Or not.  Maybe you win but then you'd be dead.  Who wants to play?  Trigger triumphant music.</p>

                            <p>The people on payroll at the 'Universities' have thought that it was really funny (in a haha teach her a lesson way) that I didn't understand that the only point of University or education was the pieces of paper with the qualifications on them.  Because those could be used to get high paying jobs.  So the point of education was about getting those pieces of paper and using them to get high paying jobs.</p>

                            <p>So the value, then of the pieces of paper.  I guess I was supposed to do anything anything anything anything for Sterelny so that he's day I'd done enough for a PhD.  Give him 500,000 words of research if that's what he wanted from me.  Re re re re re re re enrol in the 'Univesrity' for 10+++  years.  Anything anything anything.  If the 'University' stops paying me maybe he'll choose to 'support' me still and move me into his house.  Maybe I could do the cooking and cleaning for him while he gives my work to other people for htem to claim credit for themselves.  People seem to like me.  Oh yes.  I've never had a problem with people not liking me.  I see how they like to treat me.  For sure.  I don't know why anybody would choose to stay with them, voluntarily.  Well treat me worse until I learn, then! </p>

                            <p>How badly does NZ have to treat me before I go running back to Sterelny?</p>

                            <p>That sounds like a game I can only lose.</p>

                            <p>I'm soooooo glad they decided to sent Sterely to the Australian National Univesrity 6 months after I arrived.  Being in Australia really felt like getting away from New Zealand...  Where there was never never never going to be a job for me.  Because people like me so much.  Right?  They like me sooooooooo much that I must be forced to be dependent on them...  That's how much they like me.  Yeah, right.  That's how they like me.</p>

                            <p>It's personal apparently.  We don't have 'experts' we have 'personalities' so everything is personal in NZ.  WE don't really have media.  Journalism.  We have personalities.  That's right.  John Key was a personality rather than a Prime Minister.  Wouldn't you say?  He thought he was being a cheeky boy flirting with a waitress.  Wasn't coming across all Epstein Creepy 'wasn't me pulling your tail was my wife!'  How many bottles of wine for her to pull your tail wink wink.  *Sir*.</p>

                            <p>Australasia doesn't seem to be trying to be anything other than a prison or detention camp.  I don't know that it is a prison camp of England, anymore.  Seems more a prison camp of the USA.  Well send me to North Carolina and have me hand them over work for non-credit!  Pay me a graduate student stipend for 1  year of work from me that you can take from me and give to who?  Who gets credit for the work that I hand to you then?  What is the point of it?  'Why would we support you when we could support one of  our own'.  Because you would have to credit one of your own.  But why would you have to credit one of your own.  Why not turn the University of North Carolina Hill into a detention camp?  Take all the work from your students and reattribute authorship to other people.  Give them pieces of paper so they can go off to manage prison or death camps of their own.  What a great idea.</p>

                            <p>If the pieces of paper are that f*cking important, then, then take the pieces of paper I've already got (my undergrad and honors full time GPA) and use those, then, to process an application from me ot Medicine.  Oh, now the pieces of paper are worthless  Don't count for anything at all.  We have decided that you aren't academically good enough, you see.  It's a personal decision that isn't made on the basis of your full time GPA at all.</p>

                            <p>They aren't even pretending to grade the students work properly anymore.</p>

                            <p>They are being clearer about bullies and pedophiles and abusers being most valued.  Hand picked because of their personalities.  Those are the personalities they want for positions where they will pay and pay and pay and pay them vast sums of money to manage and maintain and grow their detention and death camps.  Most valued.</p>

                            <p>Not even trying to be fair at all.</p>
