 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">

                            <p>The University of Otago has just sent me an email saying that I am no longer a student from their University so I can no longer use their Word 365!  Oh Happy Days!  The NZ court precedent was that there isn't any problem with NZ Universities enrolling students in programmes of study that they never even applied to be enrolled in,  you see!  Justice Toogood can't see anything wrong, at all, with NZ Universities recording that studnets are enrolled in things they never applied to (e.g., MPhil with University of Waikato in 2019 -- when I never applied to be enrolled in that course.  Also MPhil with 01 May start date in 2018.  I never applied to be enrolled in that course.  The course they enrolled me in doesnt' even exist in the Univesrity Calendar.  The course code doesn't match any of their formal offerings.  But the IRD tells me that I owe the government because they have recorded that I owe the government.  But they can supply no application from me to enrol.  What 'Universities'?  There's nobody home. </p>

                            <p>I will update the layout etc of this site at some point.  I got it up relatively quickly so I had a place to put my work that various Universities refuse to acknowledge.  Why?  I don't really know.  Sterelny would say 'it is soooooo competitive'.  Someone else would say that people would give their eye teeth to have jobs in Philosophy.  But they had a job in Philosophy and they had their eye teeth, still, so I guess it was just my eye teeth that they wanted, or something.  I don't know.  I wonder if the people they picked out to say had done enough for PhD completion actually had their work sent out to externals or if they just told them they had done enough.  I mean to say, when you don't send out some studnets work it does make you wonder what (if anything) the people did who did get acknowledged as having completed their qualifications.</p>

                            <p>You can see, from here, that I wrote a 50,000 word MA thesis for University of Waikato.  The time-line on that was that it completed over 2 full academic years and 1 summer school period.  A 120 point only research Masters Thesis.  This is not uncommon for NZ Universities.  I am thinking of at how I know a couple other studnets who did MA theses, with University of Auckland, paraticularly, where they were supposed to be 1 year research qualifications on the back of an Honors Year.  For both of those students (I could name them) they were required to spend 2 full years working on their thesis.  The Univesrity always has some reason to get people taking 2x the time (to double their enrolments).  If you are meek they will eventually acknowledge you have done enough for Masters Credit...  After 2 years it used to be.  But why stop there?  WHy not require studnets to spend a decade or three?  </p>

                            <p>I then went to the Australian National University from 2006.  Nobody from NZ suggested to me that my Masters thesis be examined for acceptability as a PhD thesis (since you only  need to work for 2 years before you can submit for PhD, even).  Nobody from NZ suggested to me that I apply for PhD in NZ.  They were all about 'there aren't any jobs in NZ, there won't be any jobs in NZ, there will never be any job for you, they will hire overseas graduates rather than hiring from NZ universities and Australia and the USA will hire their own over NZers so there isn't any point enrolling in a PhD in a NZ University because there never will be a job for you'.  Not even trying to be attractive for studnets at all.  WHy do a PhD in NZ, then?  Because people have family ties in NZ, apparently, and so they are happy to spend several decades telling everyone they are a PhD studnet and that can be something they do instead of them having a job.  Pay and pay and pay and pay the Univesrity more and more and more fees for more and more and more enrolment.  Hand over their work so that others can take the credit for it.  That sounds like such fun, doesn't it?  Being a slave for NZ Universities?</p>

                            <p>You can see the seminars I wrote and presented at conferences (write-ups are available on the seminars page, and also powerpoint presentations that I distributed printed versions of).</p>

                            <p>You can see the amount of research that I did in 2006 and 2007 and then how I went to the USA for 2008 and 2009 academic year (where my doctoral enrolment was supposed to be on hold since I was out of the country and being payrolled by the USA for a year and not being payrolled by my Australian PhD scholarship at all).  So that's 2 years of research before I left.  Handed over to the ANU.  Then I get back from overseas and what evience is there of supervision?  There was just nothing there.  But that's okay, I supply a thesis, anyway, to my named supervisor and also inform the Univesrity administration that I have a document more than 100,000 words in length.  So they never get it to externals.  Just tell the government they need more and more and more and more and more money for keeping me re re re re re re re enrolled.</p>

                            <p>They will blame me for saying that I needed to be re-enrolled.  That there were various reasons why I need extension after extension after extension.  But my job isn't to externally examine my own work -- is it?  Did I need an extension, did I?  Compare my work output to various other studnets who were told they had done enough for credit for the work they had done.  Was my work less than or of lesser quality than theirs?  The Australian National University didn't have any problems giving me summer research scholarhip.  After that giving me PhD scholarship.  Sending me to the USA for an academic year so I could hand over work to Duke and UNC Chapel Hill for 'no credit' as an 'auditor' of courses.  THen not getting my doctoral work out for external examination.  F*cking psychopaths.  </p>

                            <p>You can even see a more than 100,000 word thesis document that I gave to my supervisor and the university administration.</p>

                            <p>Turns out that universities get more and more and more and more money for keeping studnets re re re re re re enrolled.</p>

                            <p>I wanted to do Medicine rather than work as a Philosophy academic.  It was not enjoyable being a PhD student where my supervisor didn't actually do  his job of supervising me, at all.  What evidence do I have of that?  Well, you can see the work I did.  What work did he do?  Where is evidence of him meeting with me?  Telling me what to read?  Where are comments on my work?  When did he get my work out for external examination?</p>


                            <p>University of Auckland told me that I needed to complete a new qualification from a NZ University.  I applied to do a 1 year MPhil with University of Waikato in 2018 (120 points MPhil with 05 March start date).  I told them I wanted to complete the 120 point 1 year MPhil in 1 year so I could study Medicine with Auckland in 2019.  The University of Waikato had a yakkity yak yak yak meeting, then, and decided amongst themselves that that was impossible.  They would not allow it.  They then refused to enrol me in the programme I applied to, enrolled me in programmes I never applied to (with very different enrolment dates over more than 1 year), refused to get work I had done out to externals, refused to allow externals to sign off on the qualification completion etc etc etc.  They ended up keeping false enrolment records and false transcripts.  They recorded that I had been failed for qualifications that I had never even applied to be enrolled in!</p>

                            <p>You can see the 14 September 2018 thesis that they never got to externals.  You can see the 05 October under 50,000 word 120 point one year 1 EFT Masters thesis that they sent out with instructions that it be externally examined as a up to 100,000 word 360 point three year 3 EFT doctoral thesis.  You can see that the examiners kept that thesis, then, though they were required to say that insofar as it was acceptable (as a doctoral thesis) it would need changes to the substance.  The Uni calendar says that when substantive changes are required before it is accepted either (1) the examiners will return the thesis and the student will have another 6 months enrolment (followed by another 3 months re-examination) else (2) the examiners will keep the thesis and the substantive changes are to be completed within 10 weeks.  The examiners kept the thesis.  Within 10 weeks I supplied the University with a 05 January 2019 version that had been substantively changed.  They refused to get that to examiners.  Within 10 weeks I also supplied the University with a 24 February 2019 version that had been substantively changed and they refused to get that to examiners.  On instructions from the Research Dean I wrote extensive commentary explaining how I couldn't make all the changes the NZ examiner (particularly) suggested since I was only enrolled in a 50,000 word 1 year MPhil and not a 100,000 word 3 year PhD.  I had done all the changes I could be expected to do within 10 weeks while keeping the document within the required length of under 50,000 words.  The University refused to get the commentary to externals. </p>

                            <p>They then kept me working for another year (another 6 months followed by another 3 month external examination) and when the overseas based external said I'd done a bunch of stuff he hadn't really asked for and asked for an oral defence they refused to schedule one and recorded on my transcript that I failed the qualification.</p>

                            <p>Meanwhile, the University of Auckland declined my application to Medicine in 2019 and again in 2020 on grounds I was 'ineligible to have applied' because they refused to accept that I'd successfully written a 120 point MPhil for Waikato in 2018.  I learned that the Education and Training Act states that domestic adults are eligible to be enrolled in whatever programme they have applied for,  by statute, however.  In other words, their decision to decline my application on grounds of 'ineligibility' was ultra vires.  They were required to process my application on the basis of it's academic merits, therefore.  They published a selection algorithm saying how full time GPA, UMAT / UCAT score, and interview score determine a ranking and places are offered to candidates on the basis of their rank order score.  They published an algorithm as to how they would calculate the full time GPA (last 2 years of graded full time study including summer school papers above stage one.  Best 120 points per year if more than 120 points per year were done).  According to this my GPA is 8.6.  They refused to calculate it correctly.  They refused to correct their wrongs.   </p>

                            <p>In both these cases (for both Universities) I exhausted internal complaints resolution process.  I also took the issue to the Ombudsman.  The Ombudsman wastes 1 year on an investigation and says a bunch of non-binding how he doesn't really see anything wrong.  The VC of Waikato told me to take them to court if I didn't like it.  I took them to court, therefore.  The University of Waikato (a public university of NZ) chose to spend tens of thousands of taxpayers dollars asserting their right to enrol students in programmes they never applied to, keep false records about them including false enrolment records and false transcripts, asserting their right to refuse to examine studnets work and arrange for them to be examined for the wrong qualification.  Auckland University (a public university of NZ) chose to spend tens of thousands of taxpayers dollars asserting their right to throw away applications to enrol from domestic adults (who are eligible by statute) on grounds of 'ineligibility' while they record increasing levels of debt against teenagers names preferentially enrolling them (since teenagers are entitlted to a free secondary education until they turn 20).</p>

                            <p>New Zealand has not paid out reparation for various cases of abuse in state care.  New Zealand does not see anything wrong with the likes of Dr Leeks abusing children in the name of psychiatry etc.  Look at all the work they do to ensure that the likes of Dr Leeks is the only game in town.  Throwing away applications from domestic adults in order to preferentially select teenagers to train them up to be the next bullies and abusers.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>It is in the Australian Constitution that NZ is a state of the Federation of Australia.  On grounds of expediency.  There has not been a vote to have NZ's status revoked.  Australia treats NZers as second or third class Australians.  I was not able to apply for Medicine in Australia because as a NZer I can only enrol in qualifications they consider 'low value' that Australians don't want to enrol in.  I can only hand over more and more and more work to the Australian National University for them to not credit me with, at all, so they can reattribute authorship of it to someone else.  So that various other people can collect up all the research funding, of course.  So they can have all of the money for not even doing their job of supervision when they don't even have any teaching requirement at all.</p>

                            <p>Corruption.  Corruption.  Corruption.</p>

                            <p>The NZ Judiciary reappointed Justice Toogood from retirement (not proper process for appointing Judges) and he couldn't see anything wrong.  Justice Fitzgerald awarded reduced costs against me for my being technically correct (in a technical matter of ultra vires decisions being made in a case of judicial review of administrative action).  Reduced costs against me for my being right.  Seriously???  They can't award me legal fees (I'm a slave to the courts) because I'm not a lawyer.  They can't award me costs because I'm not a lawyer.  They want to say (sometimes) that schedule 2B costs (for example) written into the back of the High Court Rules can only be awarded to people who have lawyers representing them.  Auckland University chooses to employ a senior partner and junior associate as well to represent them in the High Court Proceedings.  Ms Roe contacted more than 30 lawyers on the legal aid list for Auckland and they all claimed to be too busy else conflicted out else maintained that they couldn't see the merits of Ms Roe's case.  So Ms Roe is forced to represent herself.  The lengths the University of Auckland is prepared to go to in order to enrol the teenage children of the officials in the search for the next Dr Leeks.  Not even trying to be fair at all.</p>

                            <p>Ms Roe complained to the VC of the NZVCC that Waikato was keeping false enrolment records and false transcripts etc.  Chris Whelan refused to process her complaint.  He has the statutory function of processing whistleblower complaints.  Official Information Act Request shows that he hasn't processed a single complaint of wrongdoing against any of the NZ Universities since he was appointed to office in 2014.  He says he is inundated with complaints every year and he doesn't process any of them.  He has a stock standard response where he blames the complainant for having complained and he says that the problems are personal and particular to the complainant.  The High Court Judge asserted that Chris Whelan's job was actually to ensure that his statutory function is not filled by him, is not filled by anyone.  It would be ultra vires for Chris Whelan to fulfil his statutory function, asserts the High Court Judge.</p>

                            <p>Ms Roe did not get justice in the High Court.  Ms Roe therefore filed with the Court of Appeal.</p>

                            <p>The Court of Appeal says she's required to pay a total of tens of thousands of dollars security for costs so she doesn't have an 'unfair advantage' in litigation.  Ms Roe applies for security for costs to be waived since the cases she is filing are cases of judicial review of administratie action (to do with corruption within the Universities of NZ) and are matters of considerable public interest.  The Court of Appeal asserts and reasserts and reasserts that it does not see merits to the cases and that the matters are all very very very particular and very very very very personal to do with Ms Roe.  Ms Roe appeals this with the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court reasserts that there are no merits to Ms Roe's claims and things are very very very very particular and very very very very personal against Ms Roe.</p>

                            <p>Ms Roe applies for the Ministry of Social Development to provide advance benefit payment to cover the security for costs that has been set  by the Court of Appeal and upheld by the Supreme Court.  Ms Roe stated she understands there is no right to appeal in NZ, but there is the right to justice and justice has  not  been done in the High Court therefore the courts decided that an appeal was necessary.  The Ministry of Social Development declines the advance benefit payment on the grounds that the amount set by the High Court (upheld by the Supreme Court) is "too much" also on the grounds that there is no right to Justice for New Zealanders.  Ms Roe appeals this with the Benefits Review Committee which reasserts the Governments rights to deny justice to New Zealanders and Ms appeals this with the Social Security Appeals Authority.  More than 6 months later the Social Security Appeals Authority has still not issued a Judgment on whether Justice is an essential need for New Zealanders or whether Justice is simply optional or discreetionary.  The New Zealand courts still have not paid out any compensation at all to victims of abuse in State Care.  They don't think there is anything wrong with them choosing to hire people to abuse others in state care.  </p>

                            <p>New Zealand is not even trying to be fair.  Not even trying to have a university and training system.  Not even trying to have a functioning health system.  Not even trying to have a fucntioning judiciary.</p>

                            <p>AUstralia refuses to supply voting papers to New Zealanders.  Refuses to process NZers for Australian jobs (e.g., Government positions) for Australian education and training programmes (e.g., refuses HECS government loans for Medicine, etc).  Refuses to acknowledge that NZers are Australian Citizens.  Denies Australian passports and birth certificates.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>Australasia...  There's nothing here.  Garbage waste dump of a f*cking stupid-land of idiots.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>Ms Roe presents to the ED during the first Covid lock-down when the media is telling NZ that the GPs don't want to see patients because they don't have any face masks so you will need to go to the ED.  Also they are saying that nobody is presenting to the ED because people are too scared.  THey have never seen the ED so un-attended.  Ms Roe walked too much during the lock-down and ended up with an infected foot that she thought she might need antibiotics for.  She was also worried about hookworm after having walked barefooted in the Domain.  She was kept in seclusion for more than 24 hours before they got around to filling out the paperwork required for a 5 day observation hold.  Unlawfully detained without access to a lawyer, denied a phone call to police so she could inform them of her unlawful detention and get a duty lawyer.  She was kept for 5 days in the most secure environment (including unlawful use of seclusion).  Her file notes say she was forced to take prescription medication but her file notes also say that no medication had been prescribed.  She was then kept for several days after the 5 day hold expired where her file notes say that she did not want to stay so they were going to say that she was now a 'volunteer'.  That's what it means to be voluntary.  To be written up as having volunteered.  Whether you want to be or not.</p>

                            <p>Why?   Because the "hospital" gets more and more and more and more money for keeping the beds filled.  HOstages.  Slaves.  Prison.  Detention camps.  Not even trying to be fair.  What health system?  What education system? What judiciary?  There doesn't appear to be anything here.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>Ms Roe complained about the Auckland District Health Board having kept her unlawfully detained.  Judicial review of administrative action.  Removal from office of the most senior person responsible.  Apparently the most senior person responsible for understaffing the hospitals is Ashley Bloomfield in his capacity as health general (or whatever it was). Since then they have decided to make him a professor at the University of Auckland.  Professor.  Okay...  He never applied to do PhD, never wrote a PhD, has no research output.  So they put him on payroll as Professor, now.  They pay him hundred and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to ensure they don't have psychiatrists on payroll and they have a bunch of managers and administrators and so on ensuring the beds are fill and ACC is incorrectly billed for having the beds kept full.  People are paid to ensure the ED is full and patients are being ramped outside so they can ensure all the  beds are full at all times for maximum billings.  That way Ailsa Claire and various others can take hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year for themselves to employ people only to bully and abuse and torture and wrongful death and sexually offend against the people of NZ.  Not even trying to be fair.  </p>

                            <p>The Auckland District Health Board chose to hire a QUeens Counsel for themselves.  First they refused to supply Ms Roe with her file notes.  Said they had supplied them when they hadn't and so on.  So Ms Roe initiated court action against them claiming to have been unlawfully detained (before the observation section started and after it expired).  After they signed 'we have given you all the notes there are' I was able to be more specific in what there was evidence of.  For example, the nursing notes said I had been given prescription medication but there was no prescription.  The nursing notes said I was taken by a group or team of people into seclusion and told if I didn't take it by mouth voluntariliy they would inject me with it.  But they had no authority to give me the medication at all.  It requires a prescription and there was no prescriptin.  No medical doctor had signed that I was to be given medication at all.</p>

                            <p>The Queens Counsel counter-filed to have my filings thrown out without a substantive hearing.  The High Court Judge scheduled a 1/2 day hearing of his motion to have my filings thrown out without a trial.  In that 1/2 day hearing I had my file notes entered in as evidence of the DHB behaving unlawfully.  Unlawful detention.  Unlawful drugging.  Unlawful use of seclusion.  The High Court Judge then found that there was enough in the file notes to suggest that Ms Roe had a case against the DHB.  The High Court Judge then awarded costs against Ms Roe.  To repeat:  The High Court Judge did not up hold the motion to have proceedings struck out.  Proceedings were not struck out.  But Ms Roe was ordered to pay the costs involved in filing the motion to have proceedings struck out.  Instead of the ADHB being punished by the courts for taking an unnecessary step in the proceedings (wasting everybodies time with filing a motion to have proceedings struck out when the evidence that they tried to conceal from Ms Roe was that she had a case)...  The courts choose to punish the victims of the governements crimes.</p>

                            <p>The High Court Judge ordered Ms Roe to re-file her filings and refused to supply a court date for a substantive hearing of the issue Ms Roe filed.  Ordered Ms Roe to keep slaving for the courts and to pay the courts.</p>

                            <p>New Zealand is not rule by law.  Because the Judges are not ruled by law.  They refuse to uphold the law.  The "injustices" I have taken to calling them.  Not even trying to be fair.  There isn't anything here...</p>

                            <p>I also took the University of Otago to court because they are not processing applications to enrol in Medicine properly, either.  They tell domestic adults they are 'ineligible to apply' when the Education and Training Act states that they are in fact eligible by statute.  The Universities of NZ refuse to follow the statutory laws and the judges of the courts refuse to uphold the statutory laws by supplying teeth to violations.  The University of Otago asks people to declare various things when they apply to be enrolled in health qualifications.  THey ask whether they have been a 'victim' according to police.  They ask about present health conditions.  They ask about things like this..  Saying that it is so they can provide support that people need but they aren't using the information for the purposes of support (there is no affirmative action programme for victims of abuse in state care or for disability etc).  Rather, they are using the information to exclude otherwise qualified candidates.  This is because NZ doesn't have an education or health or whatever system. It has systems of abuse up and down the land.  Yet another institution of abuse set in place by the NZ government.  NO education and training system.  No hospitals.  No schools. No universities.  System of abuse up and down the land.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  We are soooooo lucky to be born in NZ.  We don't know how lucky we are!!!! I'm sooooo glad I was born a gamma baby I don't have to work half as hard as Lord Ashley declaring unlawful lockdowns...  Not even trying to be fair.  It's soooooo competitive, apparently.  Gnawing each others arms off.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>Apparently the thing is:  And now they pay me.  And now they pay me.  And now they pay me.  And now they pay me.  Only apparently I'm waiting for them to die, actually, so I can claw the money out of their grubby dead hands.  The only point of a qualification is that they pay you they pay you they pay you.  But however many people need to die before there will be any money for me.  Justice Toogood gets reappointed into position as Judge (how old his he?  75?) because he's got nothing to lose if he doesn't find in the interests of Justice, at all.  He got to have yet another day in court.  All eyes on him all eyes on him all eyes on him.  There will be Justice only over his dead body, apparently.  Which is why, of course, it takes a certain special snowflake to be handpicked out as special to go work in aged care.  There's really nothing here.</p>

                            <p>Oh, Ms Roe gets sent a bill, now.  From the New Government Health thing.  They keep sending her a bill saying she needs to pay them more than $10,000 dollars.  See, the High Court Judge ordered Ms Roe to pay the Auckland District Health Board more than $5,000 for them having chosen to hire a QC to file a motion to have her proceedings thrown out of court without a substantive hearing.  Then the Supreme Court ordered Ms Roe to pay another $5,000 to the ADHB for her appealing the costs judgment against her with the court of appeal.  Ms Roe tried to tell the court of appeal that 'costs following the judgment' means that since her proceedings were not thrown out she wins the substantive hearing of having her proceedings thrown out.  The f*cking dumb and dumber show.  I swear.</p>

                            <p>When Ms Roe gets sent a $10,000 bill from the Health Authority (the public health system of NZ) for them having unlawfully detained her in the "hospital"..  No, that's not right.  For her having complained to the courts of NZ that the hospitals are unlawfully detaining people in the "hospital"...  After Ms Roe having given them every opportunity to put things right from within... Ms Roe reports the spam to Apple.  What judiciary?  What health system?  What education system?  There isn't anything here.</p>

                            <p>Apparently Jacinda Ardern (the elected leader of NZ) is volunteering to be enrolled..  Was she enrolled?  In Harvard, now.  For a 6 month certificate programme (or was that a Degree?) to do with something something about leadership.  Or was she put on payroll to teach?  What can she teach with a 3 year undergrad degree in con-munications from Waikato (allegedly or apparently that is her highest level of university qualification)?  Does she get to room-share with the leader of Norway?  Party party party in the Dorms??  What the hell...</p>

                            <p>Not even trying to be fair at all.  There's nothing here.</p>

                            <p>"Hauser your stats"  is when you "clean your data" so that you change what you don't like / want into what you do.  Not willing or able to keep accurate records.  Scummy hoax of a farce of a scam.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>Did Jacinda apply to be enrolled in Harvard?  Or apply for a job there?  Are people from the US still picking out which of the natives brains they want?  They were going after the rugby players, I thought.  Richard Faull (he takes the Fall hahaha) or Professor Glue's Glue Factory.  Manufacturing LSD to give to people in the hospitals so they can better gaslight them into seeming delusional so they can be court ordered to remain indefinately in state care.  What happened to Brian Tamaki?  Last I heard the government was sooooo scared about him being a terrorist they thought to play "baby shark" at him (to soothe him, one can only suppose) and imprison him (that's how scared they were of his terrorist activities).  He was going to run for election...  So I guess he's imprisoned now, so that he can't.  There is no alternative.  We don't know how lucky we are.  Obviously.</p>
