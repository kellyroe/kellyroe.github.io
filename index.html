                                <p>Apparently the New Zealand Government is presently working on the development of some kind of National Curriculum Standard by which they mean to indicate to certain people's children that they have been hand-picked to go to University so they can become Government Employees in the Health, Education, Law kinds of sectors, or whether they are deemed illiterate and innumerate such that nobody will process any of the documentation they provide about how the New Zealand Government is unlawfully keeping people detained or enslaved refusing to pay them and unlawfully recording levels of debt against their name.  That is what that means -- right?  Ministry of Education employees will inform studnets (on the basis of their parental post-code and Secondary School attended, and race, and whatever disability information they have etc etc etc) whether the student has been hand-picked by them as most likely to be most rape-y at law camp etc etc to be made judge, one day.  Pulled out of retirement (after 40++ years of Government Payroll) to further the cause of oppression against the people etc.
                                </p>

                                <p>John Matthewson asked me, at one point, how it was that I had done work on so many different things during my candidature at the ANU.  I said that I wasn't sure, really, I just kept working, and Kim Sterelny (my supervisor) just kept basically ignoring the work that I had done, not really accepting it, so I ended up working across a range of different things.  Just sort of starting a new angle or whatever.  I remember John Matthewson telling me, in return, that it did not matter who did the work, at all, it was all about who is credited as having done the work.  I suppose what I take from the situation now is that the reason why I am not being credited as having done the work is because they decided they would rather keep me as hostage or slave (keep working, keep working, keep working, and when you are done working then f*ck off and die for all we care) and give my work to others for them to receive the credit for it.  I suppose that makes the very very best sense of the reluctance of them to acknowledge me as the author and their reluctance to credit me with the work that was done.  Paul Griffiths wrote about how the point of the social emotions is to control people.  You use guilt and shame and so on to have people comply with what you want.  People who have conscience are most susceptible to being guilted and shamed into doing whatever it is that you want.  You accuse them of not having a social conscience, not being a team player, and so on.  To get them to comply with your wishes.  Just keep working, just keep working.  It's garbage garbage garbage you are garbage garbage garbage keep working.  Just keep working.  Just hand over all of your stuff.  Just keep working handing over all of your stuff.  Hey, why not write a complaint, then?  Hey, why not revise and resubmit your complaint then?  Hey just keep working just keep complaining.  Hey write another complaint.  Just keep complaining.  
                                </p>

                                <p>I don't know who got credit for my work, exactly.  John Matthewson used to say that 'ideas are cheap.  It doesn't matter where you get your ideas from or who has the ideas it is all about who gets credit for having written up the ideas'.  I used to write my conference presentation talks as written with powerpoint slides to accompany.  I would print off the written talk and the powerpoint presentation (sometimes, othertimes I'd just print off the powerpoint presentation) and I would distribute that at conference with my work email so that people would contact me about it, or whatever.  So they could reference me, I guess.  I would also leave spares in rooms so that people could find it and take a look even if they had not atteneded the talk themselves.  I've put that stuff up on this website, now.  So you can understand that many people had access to my work even when it had not been formally published in the journals under my name.  
                                </p>

                                <p>I guess I'm supposed to 'lie flat' now.  By which they mean curl up and die.  Others have profiteered from having me do all of this work without my being credited for it.  They have taken the research funding and the jobs for themselves.  And they all rightly belong to Kim Sterelny.  Right?  He is the God of Philosophy in Australasia.  The only person who decides who gets credit and recognition and paycheck.  Right?  And the answer to that is who likes to socialise with Sterelny and stroke his ego and spend their time pandering to him.  I suppose.  Because without those things...  Well, check his ANU email outbox for all the supervision he offered me.  He was paid by the French Government?  The Jean Nicod Prize?  He wrote about 'The Evolved Apprentice' which was, effectively, how you keep people as slaves.  You don't teach them anything.  You don't acknowledge anything they do.  You refuse to train the next generation.  You refuse to acknowledge anything they do.  You take their outputs and claim it as your own else you give it to people who don't have the capacity (willingness or ability) to do anything.  You you you you you.  Quite the life for you.  
                                </p>

                                <p>I don't entirely understand the why.  Perhaps it is supposed to motivate and inspire people to spend a few hundred thousand US dollars on a University education.  By undermining the value of the Australasian  system.  Since the Australasian system is not properly handling applications to enrol, progressions, is not supervising people properly and (failing that) is not getting out of their way and getting their work to externals in a timely fashion to allow them to be signed off as having completed.  Sterelny chooses, apparently.  Because it's all about the parties, or some such.  There isn't any Philosophy of Mind in Australasia, anymore.  Guess you will need to pay the US to get to study Philosophy.  If you want to write up narratives of the experimental work such as that done my Marc Hauser (who apparently lost his lab for his role in students falsifying their data etc) then you might want to study in Australasia.  That's what Australasia wants to be.  Else that's what Australasian Government has decided to do.  To sell out the people.  There's nothing here...  Party party party.  Let's have a party.  Let's figure how to make the tools of oppression even more perverted (health, education, law)...
                                </p>

                                <p>The strange thing, to me, is that people seem to lack the cognitive capacity to think that one day it will come down to them and their conscience.  I mean to say, people die alone, in fact.  It isn't something that you share.  But biggest mob of bullies always wins -- right?  It's all about huddling in with the biggest herd.  Right?  That's what morality means in Australasia.  It's about compliance with government directive to sacrifice yourself for them.  Of course.  Clearly.  It's all about you sacrificing yourself so the people who take take take take take the most from everybody else can have more and more and more.  That seems right.  Allllll of the research funding for 1 or 2 or 3 people who don't appaear to have the willingness and / or ability to do much of any work in the actual field. They can ensure the prevention and prohibition of anything in the field.  Because all fields are the samey samey same same.  Taking all of the stuff from the people (keeping them as poorly and oppressed as you can get away with) and just sort of living as long as you can before people take hammers to the back of your head because that appears to be the only sort of justice that there is in these parts.  By design.  Quite.  Quite the lesson to everyone on the world stage, I suppose.  Do what the Northern Hemisphere Governments tell you when they tell you becuase they tell you else you will be deported to the Borderlalnds of Australasia.  Not even trying a little bit to even pretend to be rule by law, at all.  No functioing education, health, or judicial system.  Nothing to see.  Nothign nothing nothing at all.
                                </p>

                                <p>It does not matter, at all, what the laws in New Zealand or Australia are -- for the simple reason that the Judges will not uphold the laws.  By Judges I mean to say 'judges'.  If you look into the process that was (or was not followed) when it came to their appointment.  What they have been reappointed to do, in other words.  Apparently 40  years of being on Government Payroll as Government Prosecutor and as Judge is not enough for some people.  They need to be hauled out of retirement after a lifetime of Government Employment then kept employed so as to ensure that certain other people never ever ever ever ever have jobs.  All of the employment and all of the Government Payroll for them.  Send a generation or two of people off to die because..  Because you are getting away with it, I suppose.  Because Australasia doesn't need to develop a vaccine or put a satellite in space.  It can simply free-ride off of the other Governments who will pay people willing and able to do things like that.  It can simply choose to function as an unlawful detention camp or an unlawful slave camp.  Refusing to enrol, progress through, sign off on completion of training.  Refusing to publically advertise Government jobs, refusing to acknowledge Australasian Qualifications, even.  Simply refuse to do any of the things that the Statutory Laws say the Government jobs are.  For example, Chris Whelan with the Statutory Function of Upholding the Quality and Integrity of NZ Univeristy Qualifications by ensuring that we have whistleblower protection laws so as to ensure that our Education and Training System doesn't degenerate or disintegrate into a slave or detention camp.  The Tertiary Education Commission having the Statutory function of ensuring that qualifications are 'right sized'  so that a 3 year Degree does not equate to a lifetime of labor for the Univeristy with no pay.  The people employed by the Government to ensure the Quality of New Zealand University Qualifications think that their job is to ensure that the people of New Zealand are kept as hostages or slaves.  So that certain other people can have 2x or 3x or 10x the employment and payroll of everybody else.  Because of all the work that they do ensuring that the pedophiles and wrongful deathbringers are preferentially hired onto Government Payroll to be teachers and doctors and lawyers...  There's nothing here.  Read the judgements from the Supreme Court for yourself.  Does that seem, to you, like the judgements of a functioning Judiciary?  Does it look like there is even a teeny tiny little bit of 'try'?  The function of Psychiatry is the same as the function of Education and Law and the same as the function of everything else...  It is simply or merely a tool that the Government uses against the people in order to keep the people oppressed.  That's why it does not matter what you are 'deployed' into.  All jobs have the same end or goal. The keeping of as many people as badly as possible.  That really makes the very best sense of what you see in New Zealand and indeed in Australasia.  The choices that the Government Departments make (they refuse to use internal process to uphold justice and fairness and to right their wrongs).  They choose to use it to delay only.  They have been taken over by psychopaths, in fact.  There is nothing there.

                                <p>We are apparently supposed to believe that this guy has mad skillz such that he was able to forge a working barcode on a University of Auckland Student Identification Card. 

                                https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/middlemore-hospital-impostor-doctor-pleads-guilty-to-forging-document/JCAC2D3J3SJJRN63P2H4PC2RKQ/ 



                                  No?  They didn't have Student Identification Barcode Scanners in the Cadavar Dissection Lab.  When I was at Auckland they were scanning student barcodes on LECTURE THEATRES and ALL LABORATORIES.  I mean, you can't observe water, at the University of Auckland, without a working barcode.  Trust me, they are ensuring that you have paid your fees (and then some) in order for you to even be allowed on campus.  We are supposed to  believe he forged himself a Student Identification Number (present on the student id) and the Student Idenficiation Number that he forged for  himself on his Student Identification Card happened to match a Student Identification Number on the Roll for that class.  How many students is it to a Cadaver?  Is it 6 these days?  The group did not notice that their group had an extra student in it?  The tutor did not notice?  I mean, it defies credibility and it defies plausibility.  The most likely explanation is that this guy said or did something the Univesrity Administration or Governmetn did not like so they have decided to imprison him (like Brian Tamaki).  It isn't plausible, at all, that he fake himself a working Identification Card student number.  I think anybody who has done first year Health Science at the University of Auckland will know full well that this story defies credability.  What did he say or do?  He told someone with fibrosis of the lung that they needed to get an imaging scan.  What a crime.  We don't have radiologists, you see.  Apparently the Government was paying the radiation oncology people (radiate people on instructions from management?) thinking that they were Medical Doctors and thinking that they were Radiologists.  That sort of defies credability, also, honestly.
                                </p>

                                <p>I find it funny (strange, not funny haha) that the Dean of the School of Research, University of Waikato would instruct me to look deeply into her eyes and..  What?  Beg and plead for her to send my thesis out to external examiners...  Like she is paid to do...  To take the thesis from the student and post it out to the external examiners with instructions for them to examine it, in accordance with University regulations, for the Degree the student had applied, by the deadline, to be enrolled in...  She wants me to look her in the eyes, apparently, and say anything anything anything anything anything anything anything...  That will suitably motivate and incentivise her do, uh...  Do the f*cking job, for which she is paid.  I said to her 'is that what you want from your Medical Doctors?  You want them to look you in the eyes and say anything anything anything anything anything...'  Apparently so.  That is the standard or quality of healthcare that she wants, that she desires, for herself.  Not only herself -- but for everybody else.  Apparently the University of Waikato wants a Medical Training Programme so that the University administration can teach the students a little lesson or two in saying or doing anything anything anything anything anything the University Administration says...  The Waikato Hostpial is about the biggest Hostpial in Australasia.  They (for the most part) refuse to employ NZ trained Medical Doctors because, uh, there aren't any.  They find that people from developing nations overseas are more inclined to do anything anything anything the administration says (without pay). Go figure.
                                </p>

                            <p>The alliance between North America (USA and Canada) England (UK) and Australasia was, I thought, one that was based on things like democracy and rule by law.  Australasia refuses to be rule by law, however, things are too corrupt in these parts.  The Australasian Government seems to be choosing to keep a series or system of detention camps where the Justice, Education, and Health systems are used as tools of oppression against the people.  This website documents how the Tertiary Education System of Australasia refuses to train workers, refuses to sign off on completion of the training, refuses to grant qualifications to all (and only) the people who have meet requirements for the qualification, refuses to follow fair selection processes or their own published regulations when it comes to selecting which studnets to enrol, refuses to get supervised work out to external examiners in  timely fashion.  The Universities think their job is to keep detention camps where the studnets pay the University and / or the Government pays the University for detaining the student.  This feeds in to how the Judiciary refuses to uphold the laws.  The Judiciary seems to function as a tool of oppression against the people.  The Judicial Review page shows how the appointed judges (or judges pulled out of retirement who weren't even appointed properly) refuse to uphold justice.  They deny half the laws.  They deny the evidnece that has been put before them.  I have also documented how the Health System also is a tool against the people.  They are not processing applications to medicine properly.  They are not signing off on completion of training.  They put the Medical Students to work passing themselves off as Junior Doctors or Training Specialists or Consultant Specialists when they have not met requirements or when they have met requirements they deny them the qualifications and the training places and the supervision and the pay checks.  They have people kept in conditions of torture in the name of 'prisons' and 'psychiatric detention' and 'education schooling' and 'aged care' and it is just a system of detention camps up and down the land.  The Governments won't pay for the provision of social services (won't pay people to be doctors, teachers, lawyers, judges) and the like.  Not unless they are punative bullies and abusers.  Brian Tamaki gets locked up in Mt Eden because they don't want to hear how they are keeping detention camps.  Dr Leeks get to be placed in charge of selection, training, and sign off on Psychiatrists in New Zealand and Australia.  What you have to do in order to get a reference to be employed for a 'Social Services' job in Education, Health, Justice, in Austalasia.  There isn't anything here...  
                            </p>

                            <p>I have lodged a complaint with the Vice Chancellor of the Australian National University about them not processing applications to enrol properly (they say they decline my application on grounds they refuse to accept that anything on my writing page constitutes a 'writing sample' and they say that they do not have anybody willing or able to supervise research at that University).  The Vice Chancellor instructs me to re-write my complaint again and again (to 2 different Deans) and they say that I need to re-write my complaint again and again and again and again...  They simply refuse to acknowledge that they have received any complaints.  This is what Chris Whelan of the New Zealand Vice Chancellor's Committee was appointed to do.  When he isn't  blackbirding for student slaves in Vietnam or Brazil or Malaysia he is writing how he has recived precisely no complaints of wrongdoing about any of the Universities of New Zealand.  When AUT chooses to enrol a 14 year old girl in a Finance Degree (when 16 is the minimum age for University enrolment and when the Education Act states that Domestic Adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible to be enrolled in programmes they have applied to --  but the Universities withhold applications and choose to use discretion they believe they have to enrol teenagers).  When there are media reports of studnets claiming to have been sexually abused or used by supervisors before being deported without their qualifications (with or without a period of being drugged and detained in teh name of psychiatry services) Chris Whelan, apparently, has received no complaints.  When at least 1 person is found to be enrolled in the University, paying fees to the University, paying accommodation costs to the University -- while being dead for over 1 month.  Chris Whelan has recived no complaints at all about any of the New Zealand Universities.  Except for mine.  And the Judge pulled out of retirement to see no wrong writes that Chris Whelan would be behaving unlawfully if he performed his statutory function and actually Chris Whelan was appointed only to ensure that New Zealand would achieve 'lowest rate of perceived corruption' by being so corrupt as to pay him more than $200,000 per year to write only how he has never received a single complaint about wrongdoing from any of the Universities of New Zealand.  Where are all the theses?  For all teh studnets that the Unviersities of New Zealand say they have enrolled in graduate studnet research qualifications?  Where are they, then?  The Edcuation Act states that research is required to be the primary function of Universities.  Where is all the research, then?  Where is the research output of the studnets and the faculty?  Where are the journals?  Where are the books?  Where are the PhD theses and the enrolment dates associated with the production of the documents?  A PhD is supposed to take 3 years (extendible to 4 because it could take up to 1 year for the external examination process to work through).  Australasia seems only interested in keeping people unlawfully detained -- many of them won't get their PhD's until or unless they are literally dead so the Governmetn will never pay them.  Worse, many of them won't get their undergraduate Degrees until they are literally dead.  Worse, look at the people the Government chooses to acknowledge.  Dr Leeks gets hand-picked to select and train and graduate people as Psychiatrists.  To keep the instititions where we can put people when it looks like they have the willingness and ability to get their f*cking work done in a timely fashion.  Australasia cannot claim to have Universities.  Hospitals.  Judiciary.  There's nothing here.
                            </p>

                            <p>The Australian National University is not willing and / or able to supervise graduate research in philosophy.  They tell me they did not receive my research proposal (for any topic) from me, but there is no supervision available in the Philosophy Programme for 2022.  So, I suppose they didn't have any Philosophy students starting their PhD in 2022.  Else, they intend to refuse to provide supervision to those students.  They are done pretending to offer supervision to me.  Time to scammy scam some younger ones.  They like 'em young for the party party parties, you see.  I provided a research proposal to my former supervisor (who previously judged my work to be very good and expressed willingness to supervise me on a topic of his choosing) but they don't acknowledge the research proposal and he refuses to be a referee.  What kind of `employer' or `supervisor' refuses to write their employee or student a reference?  One that doesn't want to pay them and (more importantly) doesn't want anybody else to pay them either.  I think you have to be a violent sexual offender to get a reference, these days.   
                            </p>

                            <p>The writing page shows a 100,000 words + thesis that I provided to my supervisor, Kim Sterelny on the topic of his choosing.  More than 10 years ago...  He still hasn't given me any concrete comments on it as to what I need to do before I should get it to the external examiners.  He hasn't told me that he has read it, yet.  He also hasn't told me that if I want to get a thesis to externals then it is despite him or in spite of him and not at all because of him.  Does it look to you like he helped me with the thesis?  He chose the topic for me.  The evolutionary aspect to cognitive breakdown.  I didn't really see how viewing the phenemonon as evolutionary (or as a matter of breakdown) was particularly useful or helpful.  But it was a topic of his choosing.  A topic he was apparently willing to supervise me on.  So, where is evidence of his helping, then?  Does it look like a thesis that was produced under Sterelny's supervision?  What do they pay him for?  All the teaching that he does?  No?  Waiting on you, Sterelny.  Any time you are ready to unpack your stuff and get to work. The job for which you are paid.  My ANU student records are full of people in the Philosophy Programme saying that they should get more money from the government to keep me enrolled as student.  They say that my progress as student is just fine.  Nearly a full draft.  A full draft.  They expect me to submit by a certain date.  But they never get the work that I have given them to the examiners and there won't be evience of them having helped me with it in their email outboxes.
                            </p>

                            <p>Here is a question for you.  Is a student supposed to write the thesis and then softbind the thesis and then submit the thesis for external examination to a timeline.  For example, if it is reasonable to expect to take 1 year for external examination (3 months followed by 6 months changes followed by 3 months external examination for a total of 12 months of examination) then submitting a 3 year PhD thesis at the end of the second year would be the way to go.  Or, is the student supposed to work to a timeline set by their supervisor where their supervisor tells them when they are ready to submit the thesis?  Are you supposed to get your supervisor nice and drunk and get them to sign off on your submission date in that way 'by agreement'?  How is it supposed to go, exactly?  What if your supervisor just says 'keeeeeeep working'?  
                            </p>

                            <p>Supervisors have (one would suppose of a premier research university like the Australian National University) had experience with supervising before.  So they have supervised PhD students before.  So they have some idea of how long various things take and some idea of a realistic timeline to completion.  But the PhD student has, typically, standardly usually, not written or worked on or submitted a PhD before.  Who is being employed to  help who?  Or is the job to prevent and prohibit and obstruct.  Maybe the student only gets their PhD when they kill their supervisor.  Maybe that is the idea.  Because it's soooooooooo competitive.  The supervisors go gunning for their students.  That's the nature of the competition.  Divide and conquer.  Here are the special students (set up as targets only to be hated by the other students).  Create dissent.  Division.  All very...  Motivational and inspirational.  Don't you want to join them?  Party party party.  There's nothing wrong with a good party...  But there is something wrong with being expected to party with your boss or your supervisor partiuclarly when they are not being professional with their professional duties or obligations when it comes to processing or progressing or assessing or helping you improve your work performance.  Telling you timeline information.  Who wants to party party party with Des?  18 year old applicants to medicine?  I'm sure there is a brilliant 14 year old out there who will do anything anything anything anything it's sooooooo competitive.  That is the concern about the party party party situation.  And that is the nature of the competition.  It must be soooooooo competitive such that they will do anything anything anything anything anything.  Just following orders, you see.  Anything anything anything.
                            </p>

                            <p>No?  Well..  Leave then.  Just drop all of your stuff.  Just  hand it over.  Give it to us.  Then turn and walk away.  Or curl up and die.  Whatever.  Thanks for playing.

                            Chloe says that education is a poverty trap -- but she doesn't know what education is.  Education is not a poverty trap.  Education is not a social mobiliser, either.  Education is learning about the world.  Teacher and supervisors are supposed to help the students.  They are supposed to have more knowledge and more experience then them so that they are in the position (knowledge-wise) to help them.  They are supposed to have the motivation and desire to help them.  They are paid to help them.  We don't have education in New Zealand.  We won't pay people to do that.  We pay people to prevent and prohibit people with the willingness and ability to do the job from doing the job.  We have a system of slave or prison or detention camps with the aim or goal of preventing and prohibiting social mobility.  We don't have an education system.  If you learn to read, write, do arithmetic.  Do calculus.  Learn Medicine.  It's all despite of or in spite of our 'education' institutions.  There's nothing there.  There's nobody home.  They wouldn't pay anybody to do the actual job.  The actual work.  There's just a bunch of people trying to keep slaves detained indefinately while teaching them nothing and not allowing them to do any work to the best of their ability to prevent and prohibit and obstruct that too.  It's soooo competitive.  The slaves will do anything anything anything.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            They won't pay anyone to work clinical jobs.  You pay the university or the polytech training system (they are still working on setting it up) so that the slave worker students will be put to work and the slave worker students will pay the university they will pay the university they will pay the university they will pay.  They will never stop paying.  They will never stop paying the university.  And the university (or the polytech) will put them to work in the name of their training programme.  And not write them references for the work that they have done.  Will bully them and tell them that they are incompetent and inept and they don't know anything.  Will say that this one or that one is special (so the other ones will turn against them because it's soooooooooooo competitive).  And they won't pay the doctors or the nurses or the teachers or the sterile supply technicians or anybody anybody anybody at all.  Unless you want to be one of them.  Of course.  Don't you want to be one of them?  Ensuring that there aren't any teachers or doctors or nurses or sterile supply tecnicians.  No lawyers.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing at all.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            We do pay high taxes in New Zealand.  It has been with the expectation of social services.  But the Government will not pay people to provide social services.  They won't pay the teachers or the doctors or the nurses or the sterile supply technicians.  You pay the university or the polytech system.  They refuse to sign off on your workplace internship completion.  They say you have to keep working your internship just keep doing your internship.  Just keep paying the university and also doing the work you pay your employer.  Didn't you know?  That's what work is or what work means.  You pay the university because they are your employer.  You are a student and whistleblower protections don't apply to students because they are not employers there are no employment laws for the slaves that are detained by the universities and training system that makes people pay only.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The government wants people to comply in this, that, and the other respect.  To sign off that this, that, and the other building is safe (e.g., not an earthquake risk, not a fire hazard) so that insurance companies will bear at least some of the cost of the rebuild.  And the like.  The government wants people to do what they are told when they are told because they are told.  The judges.  I would suppose.  Brian Tamaki needs to be in Mt Eden but Dr Leeks needs to go train some more students in Melbourne.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            All of the power and none of the accountability.  Nobody can function.  One of the most under-developed economies in the world.  Corruption.  They won't pay the workers.  And where does all the money go, then?  Who is getting all the money on the payroll?  People who refuse to perform their statutory functions.  Chris Whelan, still.  Refusing to process or progress any complaints of serious wrong-doing against the Universities of New Zealand.  He won't do it.  Will not do it.  I was confused a bit because OIA request from me said that he did not fly anywhere on the taxpayers dime.  But I was sure he was off blackbirding for studnets very regularly in South America and Vietnam and the like.  I suppose those trips are unrelated.  Do do remember reading abuot a...  14 year old finance graduate from AUT...  I suppose the 'minimum age' laws on Tertiary Education (16 since that is the age for consent and party party party we all know how you gotta love 'dem parties with the admin in order to have the possibility of a place at all).  I thought that was why the Auckland VC's University provided house had rooms for a basement-slave.  Party party party.  It's soooooooo competitive.  The kiddies will do anything anything anything anything anything.  Right?  That's the nature of the competition and why it is that the people with power are determined to make everything a great competition.
                            </p>


                            <p>The Tertiary Education Commission defines a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  
                            <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a>.  The writing tab shows that the University acknowledged having received my application to enrol in a 120 point MPhil with 05 March 2018 start date by their prescribed deadline.  The TEC approved the qualification as being 'right sized'.  They have the statutory function of approving qualifications and checking that the enrolment period (34 weeks) matches the FTE EFTS (1) also the points value (120).  But the University of Waikato is keeping records showing that they are not billing students in this manner, at all.  They have had every opportunity to correct their records and they refuse.  They instructed me to take them to court if I had a problem with their practices.  The courts have, thus far, refused to uphold justice.  International and domestic community need to be warned that they are lacking in honesty and integrity.  They are interested in closing ranks around their wrongs.  New Zealand isn't lacking skilled workforce or labor, at all.  New Zealand is a nasty little despot where the people with power refuse to allow other people to function.  Hostages.
                            </p>


                            <p>Here is how much the Inland Revenue now says I owe the New Zealand Government for my 'Education' and 'Training' that are not acknowledged because New Zealand qualifications apparently expire 5 years post-graduation (well, not the Judges law degrees, apparently, but my qualifications have expired): 
                            <a href="judicial-review/ird-shot.pdf" target="_self"> $104,663.</a>  You can see, then, that New Zealand does not appear to have functioning Universities, they appear to have detention or forced labor camps.  They won't progress or process academic work (particularly research).  They refuse to get official documents (theses submitted for examination) to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit external examiners signing off on qualification completions.  There is no skilled labor workforce, in New Zealand, because New Zealand has a series or system of forced labor detention camps only.  You pay the University you pay the University you pay the University you pay the University.  Maybe they put you to work as an actor playing the part of a skilled professional.  Then, when you are done paying them, your qualifications are withheld.

                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  They aren't progressing the filings. They are refusing to supply applications, refusing to process applications on their academic merits.  Apparently it isn't a matter of public interest how they pick and choose people to pass themsleves off as 'doctors' in our hospitals.
                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  Demanding me to pay more and more and more money to the courts else they force all my cases aborted, or abandoned.  <a href="judicial-review/sc-eyes.pdf" target="_self"> Here is the Judgement of the Supreme Court that I am attempting to appeal on the grounds that it is manifestly grotesquely unjust. </a>  It is like they have their eyes poked out.  Our highest court does not seem to have the conception of justice, at all.  It was the courts decision to delay Roe v University of Waikato proceedings until AFTER Roe v NZVCC and also until AFTER Roe v University of Auckland.  The Judge for Roe v NZVCC made all kinds of pronouncement in his judgment on the matter of Roe v University of Waikato.  That is to say instead of judging the issue he was supposed to be judging (the inaction of Chris Whelan in his capacity as CE of the NZVCC) he thought he would weigh in on whether or not I had done enough for completion of the MPhil Degree.  Clearly that is a matter of the Judge of a different case to decide!

                             <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  The Australian Constitution clearly names New Zealand as a state of Australia.  They say that they don't have to honor the constitution because New Zealand officials did not turn up to various things and they did not consent.  I don't know why Australia would care about consent in that instance.  Did they care about the consent of the Aboriginal people of Australia?  Did they care about consent of people to be immunised or subject to medical treatments or experimentation?  If they want to change the constitution then there is a process for it to be changed.  I think it involves a vote.  But New Zealanders don't get to vote so the Australian Government clearly does not care whether or not the people of New Zealand consent.  New Zealand functions as a detention camp of Australia.  But then, Australia still seems to govern like it is a detention camp of the Northern Hemisphere, so...

                            <p>Una Jagose doesn't seem to have the job of instructing Crown Law to prosecute corruption within New Zealand Universities, or within the Judiciary (where judges refuse to accept evidence and where the supreme court punishes people for bringing injustices before the courts).  I suppose that is why they pay her more than half a million dollars to do that job.  They pay her to ensure the job is not done by anyone.  Not by her and not by anybody else.  The fact she is in the job prevents and prohibits the job being filled  by anyone with the willingness and ability to do the job.  It seems there is no evidence that they will accept that would attest to corruption.  None of the invoicing information that I provided (e.g., 0.5 EFTS = 120 points = 60 points = indefinate enrolment).  New Zealand does not appear to have a functioning judiciary.    <p> <a href="judicial-review/crown-law.pdf" target="_self"> Blow off response. </a>

It all starts to sound confusing, doesn't it.  The gaslighting garbage output nonsense nonsene nonsense from the courts.  Denying the evidence.  Refusing to acknowledge the half of the laws that speak to the duties and responsiblities and actual job descriptions of the various government departments (e.g, the NZVCC and various of the Universities).

                            <p>Australia now seems to have a case of the 'meeeeeeee toooooooooos'.  The 'metoo' in this part of the world is when the leadership sees a practice that is more depraved and deprivation inducing than the ones they currently have and they aspire to go even lower than lower than low.  They get all motivated and inspired at just how bad things can be..  And nothing will happen.  Right?  There will be no consequences.  Right?  Because it's hell on earth.  Right?  All the work that they do to bring it to  be.  Sooooooooooo competitive.  No education.  No justice.  No meaning.  No value.  Nothing.  Just a bunch of zombies following orders.  Which is fine.  No conscience.  When I grow up I want to be a...  Sophist.  No?  Psychopath?  Wrongful deathbringer?  Pedophile in the schools?  Sooooooo competitive...
                            </p>

                            <p>I don't see the pretty 14 year old girls turning up to play 'flight attendant' in the 'job fairs'.  But we see the face of unemployment, in NZ.  Oooooh no, the people turning up for the job fares already have jobs.  They are just looking for better offers.  And the people paid to do the deciding, well they don't see 14 year old girls to abuse.  So...  Bring on the cheap migrant slaves.  C'mon other countries.  You gotta have pretty young things you want to (effectively) sentance to death.  Right?  We will give them a 'job' in NZ.  Renowned the world over for fair wages for fair work (not).  Oh please sell your child into slavery to the NZ government.  We want someone to clean Chris Hipkins (minister of everything's) toilet.  Intergenerationally.  For less than minium wage.  Get a student to do it, right Chris?  The generations 50++ year PhD in cleaning your toilet for they pay the New Zealand Education System to do their 'workplace internship' in cleaning your toilet.  Intergenerationally.  For less than minimun wage.  No recourse for complaints.  Only a 'student' -- right?  Not even an employee.  A what now?  Don't you know how many generations of slavery are required for so much as minimum wage in New Zealand?  I mean...  People must be, like, 50 years +++ behind Chris Hipkins.  Who wears his intelligence and administration skills etc etc upon his sleeve.  Because they count the votes (yeah right).  When so many are kept in government institutions without so much as a post office box to their name.  Yeah, right.  All the work that goes into the prevention and prohibition of development...  The Harry Harlow Island Based Research Program.  They sold out the health of their people for what, now?  That's why we keep them the way that we do.  Of course.  All the honors and awards for the most esteemed Jacinda Ardern.  Her con-munications Degree from Waikato.  Then her PhD from Harvard in exchange for informing the graduating class how they were welcome to harvest their designer baby inplants from NZ without criminal sanctions.  Come get your designer babies.  The most designer baby of all being Angleman Syndrome Baby, of course, who (with the help of a little horse tranquiliser) will never  be able to object, protet, or complain how you choose to sexually and physically and psychologically abuse and torture them.  Of course.  The aim or purpose of Medicine.  To drug the non-consenting.  Because they have been consented.  What part of that is difficult?  The government decides what you voluntarily do.  From your education to your employment to your death.  Right?  Of course.  I mean, who did you think was the boss of you outside your workng hours.  Your what, now?  Party party party.  Who wants to party?  Anything anything anything it's soooooooooooooo competitive....  Yawn.
                            </p>

                            <p>So the governments have this idea of terrorist bombing graduations.  That's a good idea.  That way you will never have to pay them wages for doing skilled work.  Instead of people complaining about the university refusing to give them the qualifications they have met the requirements for, instead of people complaining about them refusing to publiclly advertise jobs, refusing to hire people for jobs they insist upon keeping vacant else only filling with violent offenders, the people can just die in a terrorist attack, then.  Else maybe the New Zealand government can send them off to 'fight for Ukraine' by which I mean dump them on Russian soil in the hope that the Russian Government will be blamed for their ill treatment and untimely death.  The Medical Students staying at Carrington College get to walk through the memorial every morning on their way into Medical School.  It's been carefully placed to be a constant reminder to them of what will happen to them if they object to anything the Government chooses to do.  The Government decides what you have voluntarily consented.  You have been voluntarily consented.  What part of that is hard to understand.  You lose, people of New Zealand.  People of Australasia.  All of the tax money and none of the social services.  The Government is the major employer (pretty much everything else was forced by the Government into bankruptcy with unlawful lock-down policies enforced by the police and New Zealand gangs working togethr to ensure the logistics of drug supply etc up and down the country).  We aren't even pretending to be a  nation that is even trying even a little  bit to be rule  by law. The laws are grotesquely inadequate and even when they aren't nobody cares what they say because they aren't inforced, at all.  Australia has decided that they don't care whether or not Aborginal people are written into the constitution.  New Zealand is written into the constitution.  How is that upheld?  Well, then.  It's all just a waste of time.  Completely and utterly.  The worse things are for the people of a country the better the leaders feel about themselves.  Didn't you know?  The prevention and prohibition of development.  Shortland street always was a Government Propaganda programme designed for people overseas to watch.  It was to help us blackbird for a constant supply of 'workers' who would arrive here only to discover that we would not acknowledge their qualifications, we would not sign off on new qualifications, we would not pay them, we would not pay them, we would not pay them, we would not pay them, they are to pay us for the cost of their 'training'.  But there is no supervision and there are no qualifications.  The Government will arrange a terrorist bombing of graduation else drafting to die on foreign lands.  Deportation.  Untimly death.  The government will not pay the workers.  Will not pay the workers.  You pay the government.  You pay the government.   You need to apply for a visa.   You need a new medical exam.   The doctors on payroll are to write reports for expulsion only.  Never stop paying.  Never stop paying.  Never stop paying the New Zealand government.  Never stop.  What's that?  Time to stop paying?  Why, then, it's time for you to go away.  Thanks for playing.  How many children hostages did you leave us?
                            </p>

                            <p>'In the name of cancer-care'.  I suppose that's a way to get rid of people.  Radiation oncology.  You could prescribe to people high doses of protease pump inhibitors.  That will reduce the amount of acid being produced in their stomach.  Then you could give them some kind of a nerve block to immobilise them.  Maybe from the neck down.  You could radition treatment their esophagus.  Esophageal spincter.  Then you could suddenly stop the ant-acid medication so they get a rebound syndrome.  All of a sudden they will be producing a lot of acid and with a weakened sphincter and having been immobilised I guess they will die in their acid secretions.  That would be a way to get people.  Quite a lot you could do with radiation oncology.  In conjunction with a few other things.  That's the aim or the goal or the purpose or point of the population control strategies that there are in public medicine or public health, in New Zealand?  No?  Yes?  Just following orders.  Of course.  From the way the patients are triaged on the basis of their home address and GP details and whatever the government has in their notes on them.  Maybe it is in their notes tha the government raised them as a Fisher and Paykel inubator baby where they kept them, like in one of those old Russian Orphanages where they weren't touched by humans to try and induce attachment disorders and the like.  So everyone can learn that they have been hand-picked chosen by the Government to be all special raised to be part of a gang with the party party party party party drug shipments.  That kind of a thing.  It's not plausible to think that we need to spend the next however many generations repeating all the inhuman and inhumane research experiments etc etc that were only ever poor, thin, weak, excuses for torturing and abusing and exterminating so many people.  We know exactly what we are doing...  That's why they have all of the money and all of the power.  Right?  Because of how clever they are?
                            </p>

                            <p>I wonder how many cloned people there are?  Genetically identical to someone else.  So that one of them can be organ donor for the other, should the need arise.  That will be why the ancestry stuff is...  Well, it's becoming problematic that people have access to paternity testing and genetic analysis, and the like.  I think estimates were someting like around 1/4 of people are wrong about who their genetic daddy is.  I guess there are a whole bunch of reasons why that might be so.  Of course 'she asked for it' is the best defence of the indefensible that there is.  That's why you hear it so much.  What else could they possibly say, in their defence?  Well, then, that's what 'voluntarily' means.  Clearly.  And when you get your supervisor a 100,000 + PhD thesis they say 'they thought you voluntarily quit'.  But you didn't say that you quit.  That's what makes it 'quiet quitting'.  I suppose.  Nobody hears you say 'I quit'.  They just write you up as a quitter and they don't write you a reference.  Then, if anybody asks, it's  because you are garbage garbage garbage.  Either you didn't write a thesis else they judged it to be garbage garbage garbage.  Because that's what external examination or external assessment means, now.  It means your supervisor gets to decide.  Not just whether they themselves will give you some of the vast volumes of research funds that they get (e.g., employing you as post-doc on the topic of their choosing) -- but whether anybody else is allowed to hire you.  They decide that nobody is allowed to hire you.  Because you are garbage garbage garbage.  They won't write you a reference.  They won't allow you to have your Degree.
                            </p>

                            <p>I guess the only reason he got the job is because he looks like one of Harry Harlow or Marc Hauser's laboratory animals escaped.  They will think that's soooooooo funny.  So the people from Harvard can visit Australia during their winter.  Party party party.  Let's have a party.  Let's have a weekend party where the people from Harvard can give their talks and we can just sing about how brilliant they are all day and all night...  Make sure the work we do is only singing the praises of the work they choose to present to us.  Party party.  Who wants to party?
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Of course Shortland Street is just trying to be what Grays Anatomy is trying to be..  Whatever the current version is.  Whatever it takes to sell 1 million dollar US Degrees in the USA.  Right?  And then the cost of sitting the Step exams and all the transport and flights and tourism activities associated with that...  For what?  So people can develop drug addictions (e.g., House, Nurse Jackie) or have the authority to get subordinate employees to drop their pants in the medical supply room, or whatever.  That's why people want to spend that much money on those Degrees.  Right?  It's so motivating and inspiring.  You should pay the University, pay the university, pay the University.  For the opportunity to to anything anything anything anything anything in...  In what, exactly?  In any hospital?  Anywhere in the world?
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            So the 'graduates' from Brown got to choose.  (1)  Early graduation.  That is to say, they would be given their Medical Degrees without having completed their supervised internship.  (2)  Indefinately post-poned graduation.  Because of Covid.  That is or means to say that there aren't any jobs for them.  Nobody will pay them to work that job.  Nobody will pay people to work jobs.  There aren't any jobs.  Not for things like that.  Social services.  Health, education, justice.  Everything has been overtaken by psychopaths.  It's soooooooooooooo competitive...
                            </p>

                            <p>Soo...  How are we going to motivate and inspire a future workforce of 'radiation oncologists' who will deliver lethal doses of radiation...  Gee, I don't know.  How did they motivate and inspire people to flip the switch on the legal doses of electric shock?  We find people who will just follow orders.  Not becuase the person wears a white coat.  But because...  I don't know.  Their manager told them to.  Maybe  because of the little note that someone or other put on their file notes.  You probably want a class..  Maybe 1,000 ++ studnets.  Each of them thinking that it's soooooooo competitive.  Oooooh.  I'll do anything anything anything anything anything.  Pick me!  Ooh choose me!!  Then you create division from within the cohort...  Have them turning on each other...  All the things that go into creating a compliant poplulation who will do anything anything...
                            </p>

                            <p>That's basically the culture, here.  In New Zealand.  Why suicide rates are so high.  Also 'suicide' rates (likely state ordered murders).  The volume of people imprisoned without just cause (e.g., because they protest acts of the government during their own free time outside working hours).  The volume of people imprisoned in the name of 'psychiatry'.  The judgements of the courts.  Judges -- pulled out of retirement (refusal to appoint new judges in accordance with the process that is supposed to be employed to ensure independence of the judiciary from the government).  The gaslighting in the judgements of the judges.  The judges ordering the lawyers (if the lawyers don't voluntarily go there) to gaslight the victims.  Blame the victims.  Punish the victims for speaking up and speaking out about the government atrocities and the atrocities that the government knows is happening that they refuse to do anything about.  Their constant, repeated, persistent decisions about who they hire.  Choosing to hire people to ensure their statutory function is not performed.  Is not performed by them, is not performed by anyone.  This is not the developed world.  It is not the developed world, at all.
                            </p>

                            <p>They (governments, government departments, executive branches e.g., hospitals and universities and the like) are only supposed to be hiring foreigners when there aren't any people within the country to work that job.  All the jobs in administration and management, in NZ filled by foreigners.  All the jobs in the hospitals and the universities filled  by foreigners.  While New Zealanders have their qualifications withheld and while New Zealanders are kept in detention facilities simply because they were born in New Zealand and they are not silent about the atrocities committed by the Goverment.  The Australian Federal Government will not allow people from the State of NZ to vote in Federal Elections, to stand for Federal Office.  Will not allow peope from the Australian State of New Zealand to apply (or have their application processed for) Ausstralian Federal Government Jobs.  New Zealanders are streamed into qualifications that the Australian Federal Government itself considers 'low value' and are expected to stake second stage to Australian Citizens born of every state other than New Zealand.  But then, the main purpose or point of the Australian Government is to be second rate American Government, so, well.  So they can pay a million dollars for their Medical Degrees from the Ivy League only to be informed that they can either 'Graduate Early'
  without having supervised workplace internship signed off as completed by the University.  That is to say, they can have their Degree on an 'honorary basis' else their qualification is withheld indefinately.  That is to say, they just don't choose them.  Not to go wrongful deathbringing in the detention camps of America...  Guess they will only take your money take your money take your money.  I wonder how much the guy from South Africa had to pay the New Zealand Government to play 'Orthopedic Surgeon' in the hospitals of New Zealand for 10 days before being made bachelor again.  He must have really  hated his wife to have paid to have dumped her at Hillmorton indefinately.  Did she try and speak out about the crimes of the New Zealand Government?  About his not really being an Orthopedic Surgeon?  Only 'Orthopedic Surgeon' on payroll at Canterbury District Health Board, was he?                           </p>

  <p>Their whole attitude when you complain about them not even trying to be rule of or rule by law (governed by principles of justice and fairness and rules based order) is 'and what are you going to do about it?  you and whose army?'  Does that seem like 'rule by law' to you?  I mean, not even a little bit of 'try'.
</p>

<p>They say that if people lived the way the average New Zealander lives that we would need 2 planets.  Does the average New Zealander live the way that they actually want to live -- or do they live the way that the New Zealand Government has mandated how they will live?  Are people provided with information about how to make good food choices (e.g, ingredients lists, information about how much they pay their workers, information about their health and safety compliance, information about animal welfare conditions, information about slavery in the supply chain, information about sustainable business practices) or does the Government encourage if not actively itself choose to participate in marketing campaigns etc trying to actively create demand for things that it then wants to chastise the people for?  System of abuse.  Over and over and over and over and over.  Yawn.  So f*cking tiresome.  Hey, if what England did to the Irish during the Irish famine was tolerated on the world stage then the New Zealand Government has something even worse to aspire to -- right?  It isn't that people in these parts are so very very bad at being good.  It's more how good they are at being bad.  I mean, the principle of charity can only get us so far once we realise the state sanctioned 'charity' detention camp system of abuse up and down the land...
</p>

<p>Harlene Hayes (formerly University of Otago Vice Chancellor) trained as an Organisational Psychologist.  That is some kind or sort of a cross between management and psychology.  A large part of the source of power for occupational psychology was in control over tests.  The Univesrity of Waikato had, for example (I suppose every University would have) a Psychology Testing Library.  That would have the questions (and answers) for the personality tests and the like that would be used to select employees for various jobs.  From prison guards to all kinds of things.  I remember the Waikato people saying that various people who wanted to be prison guards would turn up to the University looking to access the Psychology Testing Library so that they would pass the screening tests to be a prison guard.  I don't know who they paid for access.  But that was a source of power.  I suppose police etc, too.  I remember the Department of Corrections required me to participate in testing when I applied for Government Jobs (entry level analyst or advisor) -- mostly so they could tell me that I test badly and they just don't choose me.  So you have more than 1 year of 'frictional unemployment' where you can live in the shed of some contractor -- right?  Anyway, here is an idea about organisational psychology...  Instead of having a normal or usual kind of a career progression where people start out on fairly low wages but work their way up within the organisation by taking on more responsibility for more pay...  What you can do is continually restructure things.  So that people are required to do more and more and more for the same level of pay...  Reapplying for their old job at less pay or whatever.  I mean, ideally, I suppose (from a maximally efficient final solution sort of ideological position) you would force people to work more and more and more for less and less and less pay.  I say this because of how terribly awfully oppressive the Univesrity of Otago environment was for many of the employees of the University.  The University would not hire more people to teach and research (you only need 1 lecturer per 1,000 studnets, or similar) so graduates are forced into administration and management jobs or other supporting roles, and then you just keep restructuring and restructuring and restructuring so more and more and more people do more and more and more busy work for less and less and less pay. While the University posts record levels of profit.  And refuses to supply applications to enrol, progress applications to enrol, progress qualification completions and the like.  I think it is important that Harlene Hayes herself trained as an organisational psychologist.  It helps understand the kind of prison camp detention camp institution that she maintained.  She would have learned about (will know full well about) the psychological effects of the continuued restructures etc.  Of course now she has been re-deployed to the Univesrity of Western Australia.  They have a selection programme (that New Zealanders can buy into -- but they will need to pay Australian Dollars for it while likely earning only New Zealand dollars themselves) where they can, effectivey, pay the University of Western Australia to take their 18 year old High School Student and enrol them in Medicine and they can send them for their internships around the Aboriginal Communities of Australia, I suppose.  I would imagine that the ideology will be that Harlene will ensure that nobody signs off on their internships, however (or that if they achieve sign-off the University won't graduate them, anyway).  That was the culmination of her career at Otago -- right?  That something like 1/3rd of the Medical Cohort were denied graduation (but put to work as Junior Doctors for the DHB's while they paid more money to Otago for continueed enrolment as studnets).  I suppose really the culmination or end game of maximal efficiency will be a terrorist bombing of graduation.  By the Government.  So that the Government can say 'thanks for all the unpaid slave labor you did while paying the University paying the University paying the University.  Now it is time for us to pay you for any work you do.  Therefore it is time for  you to die.  We have a entire new generation of studnets who will do your slabor (slave-labor) while paying the University paying the University paying the University'.  Never stop paying the University.  Else, know what?  Maybe they wil pay you to keep slaves of your own.  Right?  That's how you know you have made it in Australasia.  When they pay you enough to keep your very own Harem.
</p>

<p>Crampton said something in print about how he disagreed with the Government's assessment that the Government was not going to pay anybody to research, manufacture, supply, administer rapid antibody testing for the reason that the tests were not as effective as PCR (and not for the reason that the Government is not being merit based in procurement decisions).  He claims that he was 'expert led' in believing that the antibody tests weren't (necessarily?) getting too many false negatives.  The New York times claimed that the USA was sending some of the antibody tests back to Australia because they were getting 1 in 4 false positives.  That means to say that 10 people in every 40 who were actually negative for Covid would return a positive test.  Or, if you were negative over the course of a couple years and you took 40 of those tests over a couple years then you would be expected to test positive on one of the tests.  That was though to be an unacceptably high false positive rate.  But the New Zealand Government accused all of the antibody tests of being too likely to return a false negative.  They were more concerned about collecting Covid Positive statistics to keep up with where things were at in the world.  Where there needs to be a baseline of positive in order to indicate that there is a signal at all.  I mean to say, when New Zealand doesn't find a case but the false positive rate on the tests is 1 in 4 then you know that New Zealand isn't properly able to identify and record positive test findings.  Either people aren't reporting the postive test results or...  Corruption...
</p>

<p>It is interesting that this guy (Academic at Otago) says he 'followed the experts and not the Government' when it came to him deciding for himself that New Zealand should get with the programme and roll out antibody tests since antibody tests had been rolled out in the USA, Canada, Australia..  The other nations, already.  They were manufacturing them in Australia and quality control was apparently sending them back from the USA.  Best ship them to New Zealand then, eh?  I guess that's what it means to follow the experts?  I don't think he understands what it means to follow the expert.  That's why Jacinda got an honorary PhD in Law -- no?  Because she the apex or prime expert in Law.  Or in Statutory Law of New Zealand.  I guess?  She could be professor, now, and teach the students her memoirs?  They are writing a curriculum for the 'leadership' programme at Harvard.  Because a question on the forefront of many rich kids minds is 'how much money would you have to pay in order to be God ruler of a tiny little Pacific Island nation?'  Part of the answer was in kim.com.  MegaUploads.  Right?  What was that?  A cloud server.  We were supposed to belive that it was primarily about people uploading copyright protected (in the USA and possibly Europe) music and films.  But more likely than not it was primarily about...  Universities...  I would suppose.  Uploading porn that people filmed in the student accommodations.  The evidence of crimes.  The evidence of abuse in all kinds of State care situations.  The prisons and the schools and so on.  I would imagine.  That was the real import.  Because of New Zealand's role in being a repository for the offenders of the world.  At one point it looked like he was going to buy the election.  Right?  But now he pays the courts he pays the courts he pays the courts he pays the courts he pays the courts he pays the courts he pays the courts he pays.  And in return they find that the case becomes larger and larger and larger traversing more and more issues.  And all of these aspects need their day in court.  So he pays the courts he pays the courts he pays the courts he pays.  And in return his going to the court of appeal is deemed 'Public Interest' while New Zealand refuses to extradite him to stand trial in the USA.  I guess because he is already imprisoned in the detention camp that is New Zealand.  The University of Auckland is presently spamming emails to people telling them that the University of Auckland cloud server is being removed from alumi access, or similar.  I guess that means that the videos of who was most rape-y at law camp are coming down.  Which of the first year private school boys got to rape the 14 year old international studnets from Vietnam, or whatever, before the international studnets were deported for overstaying their visa because the government refused to accept their medical clearance.  Or whatever.  
</p>

<p>We are living in a period that will, one day, be known as culturally and intellectually and artisitically and so on the dark or middle ages.  The Government won't allow people to function.  People who proclaim that the world is round (for reasons) are imprisoned, in New Zealand.  The Government withholds funds from them in an attempt to force them into dependency on people the Government has identified as abusers, typically.  They choose to pay people to abuse others, right?  To get them to toe the line.  The line where the Government is the prime or apical expert and people listen to the Government.  Not like they would listen to an academic.  Where they listen to what they say and the reasons they have for saying and they reflect upon and consider objections and make up their own minds.  But where the Government sets itself up as a God dictating for reasons that they are not accountable for or to.  The Judges don't uphold the Statutory Laws in New Zealand  -- therefore it does not matter what the Statutory Laws are or what they say, at all.  If the Judges won't uphold the laws (deliver meaningful sanctions for ultra vires acts and deliver meaningful sanctions for people refusing to perform their statutory function) then there may as well not be any laws at all.  There really is nothing here...  The Education Act states that the primary function of Universities is research.  Look at all the research I have done for Universities where the Universities refuse to acknowledge any of the research that I have done.  Look at the research output of the University of Waikato.  How many thousands of words of research do their Philosophy academics produce per year?  Do they produce as many words per year as a first year student (e.g., 1,500 words x 2 essays per course x 7 courses per year = 21,000 words of research by a first year student writtten and examined within 34 weeks)?  Do they produce as many words per year as a second year student?  2,500 words 2x essays per course x 7 courses per year = 35,000 words per year or 34 weeks?  do they produce as much as an honors student?  2 x 5,000 words per course x 4 courses or 40,000 words per year?  do they produce as much as a masters student?  up to 50,000 words in one year?  do they produce as much as a PhD student?  A 3 year enrolment up to 100,000 words where external examination takes one year?  That's a research output of up to 50,000 words per year.  Where is all the research New Zealand?  It is like New Zealand doesn't have Universities.  THey won't pay people who do reasearch.  They will pay people who won't do research.  They will pay people to prevent and prohibit the production of research.  There always was this joke about how the Governmetn won't hire anybody with a PhD to write Government reports.  Because the Ministers are expected to be able to read the reports.  But of course the Ministers only glance at the Table of Contents.  So the entire work needs to be saying the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over so the Ministers don't need to read the reports.  I mean, you just write up (retrospectively) the best justification that you possibly can of what they have decided in quite independent grounds (for no reason) anyway.  Right?  I mean...  Let's see...  What is the best possible reason or excuse for the Government forcing people to live in mouldy houses?  Maybe because they don't believe that living in mouldy houses is harmful to people so they have decided to check and see if it is harmful to us in our unique sociocultural enviroment which will, of course, involve them requiring people to function as the control group and live in mouldy houses.  That explains why the Government needs to check just how mouldy the house is (keep on measuring the mould) and take steps to ensure that it is mouldy enough (that the exposure is high enough) to just see...  Because surely a toxic dose isn't really toxic when New Zealand is the land of immunologically elite people who aren't dead yet despite every effort from the Government.  That sounds like the kind of research project that would get Government funding.  It sounds like the only kind or sort of project that would.
</p>

<p>Apparently the New Zealand courts actually found that one young man died of myocarditis due to a Covid Vaccination.  The Vaccination wasn't one that he freely consented to having (or not having).  Was it?  Wasn't he coerced by the Government into having the vaccination on threat of him being excluded from society and excluded from employment if he refused?  Loss of livlihood.  I mean to say, did he understand, broadly, the risk and benefits of vaccination?  Or did the Government try and withhold information about risks because they were concerned that if they were informed of the risks people woud choose not to assume that risk.  I mean to say, the Government tried to withhold information about harms because they thought that if people were informed about harms they would not want to take on the risk that the Government wanted them to take on.  The Government waived the manufacturers liability, apparently.  That is to say if there is a problem with the quality of the manufacturing process or similar the New Zealand Government is taking on the liability.  Cheapest country in the world.  The manufacturers could have sent saline instead of vaccination and then if people died of Covid believing that they were immune then the New Zealand Government and not the manufacturers is responsible for yet another wrongful death.  The Government wants all of the liabilty and responsibility because...  They know full well that New Zealand does not have a functioning judiciary.  Where is the pay-out for the victims of the Governments crimes?  Did the people knowingly sign up to participate in a medical experiment?  A medical trial to see whether vaccination was harmful or helpful?  Did they knowingly sign up for 'emergency use authorisation only' 'medical treatment'?  Or were they coerced into it by the Government.  The Government does not appear to respect the people, at all.  Who is supposed to assume all the risks?  Who gets to make all the decisions about who gets to assume all the risks?  What are the consequences for a few elite individuals choosing that the risks will be assumed  by others with no responsibility, at all, for themselves?  Not a functioning democracy.  Nasty little despot.  HOw much money did Epstein pay to be God of the Virgin Islands.  (Who wouldn't want that title -- right?) Where is he, now?  Did he have an open casket funeral so his victims could see that he was in fact dead.  He didn't just pay the New Zealand Government a bunch of money to set himself up at head of the Medicine Prepratory School of New Zealand where it's soooooooo competitive the 14 year old specials will do anything anything anything anything anything anything.  
</p>

<p>So the whole idea/l of inflation is about trying to preserve the current situation and projections with respect to people position on a social hierarchy.   Because it is all about having money sufficient to position you so that you have control of as many people as possible where you can get them to do anything anything anything anything anything anything anything that you want them to do.  I mean, you could have a child.  Who is dependent on you to wipe it's arse, to feed it, and so on.  And you can train it to do your washing or cleaning or whatever.  Or you could train it to hit the other kids until the other kids do your washing or cleaning or whatever.  So you pay Chris Whelan in his position as Chief Executive of the New Zealand Vice Chancellor's Committee (with the Statutory Function of upholding the quality and integrity of New Zealand University qualifications where the Universities decide on non-academic grounds who they will enrol, who they will acknowledge is progressing through training, who they will graduate (on an honorary basis irrespective of whether they have done any academic work at all and irrespective of the quality as determined by external examiners who were not involved in any way in the production process).  And he gets paid enough so that, apparently, it isn't the New Zealand Government who pays for him to go Blackbirding in South America or Vietnam for children to enrol in New Zealand Primary or Secondary or Tertiary Education Institutions (like the 14 year old Vietnamese Finance studnet).  Rather, he gets paid enough so that these little excursions of his are paid for on his own dime.  I suppose he had a NZVCC email address that he uses to do business when it comes to how much money is to be handed over to the New Zealand Government as a kind of...  Dowry?  For the student?  Is that how to think of it?  Does he pay for his own cellphone?
</p>

<p>
The obvious absurdity in the Judge saying that he would be behaving ultra vires if he performed his statutory function.  The obvious absurdity in the Judge saying that his job was to write the NZVCC policy therefore he was not bound by the policy that he wrote  because he could change it retrospectively.  He is still on payroll.  Yes?  Several hundred thousand dollars per year to support his lifestyle.  I don't know anything about him personally.   How many people are financially dependent on him?  HOw many people are forced to live in his household for low or no rent?  Mates rates.  How many people are forced to eat the way he chooses for them to eat?  How many people are forced to wear what he forces them to wear?  And so on.  That's inflation.  The point or the purpose of it.  To keep the social structures.  The aim or the goal is to be God.  God of a nasty little despot where all the people do all day is sit around singing your praises doing anything anything anything anything anything outside a nightclub on a Friday night for $20.  Right, John Key?  That is what you think of the people.  That was your bright idea/l of how to force vaccine compliance.  Anything anything anything outside a nightclub on a Friday night.  That is how the Government wants to keep the people.  Inflaction will be arranged accordingly.  Where is the art?  culture?  meaning?  value?  justice?  health?  happiness?  NOthing to see, people.  NOthing to see, at all.  Nasty little despot.
</p>

<p>I mean, there aren't any people, at all.  The whole point or goal or aim or purpose is to command the largest zombie army.  Right?  The New Zealand Government wanted to force certain people to breed breed breed breed breed.  They will do anything anything anything for an extra $20 per week, per child?  Wasn't that the Government Guarantee?  You would get a living wage (for you) from Work and Income if you produced how many babies?  And abused them sufficiently at home such that the Government didn't feel the need to remove them and arrange for them to be absued in state care. Right?  To beat them and force them to compliance...  So they would be trained to do anything anything anything anything anything for $20 outside a nightclub on a Friday night.  Or anything anything anything for a cigarette.  That's inflation.  To withhold money and ciagarettes or anything that you can use to control people to do anything anything anything anything.  And what does the New Zealand Government value?  Apparently we are supposed to do anything anything anything the Government says..  To support the lifestyle of the Politicians?  That's part of it.  They want to fly about the world (on the taxpayers dime?) with their entourage of dependents...  God of a South Pacific Island...  Seeing how they can sell out the health (education, justice etc etc) of the people to support their own personal party party party lifestyle where people will do anything anything anything they say.  Hanging off of their every word...  That's what life is about.  Right?  Graduation is about getting to wear the fancy gown and speaking and people clap clap clap at everything you say.  That's what the culminiation of University is.  
</p>

<p>So where are the academics?  The people engaged in research etc?  Not here.  Dark ages.  Seems to be the thing of it.  There really aren't any people...  Not so far as the eye can see...  No people.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  Just a zombie army.  Living out our pathology of keeping as many in appalling conditions of deprivation and forced compliance.  
</p>

<p>They say if you get a million monkeys typing for a million years one of them will output the works of Shakespeare.  So the idea/l is to get the million monkeys (the students of the world) typing into Turnitin or GradingGrinder or whatever so that some professor can be given their output to pass off as their own.  I suppose. I suppose that is the idea/l of it.  That's why you want to be editor of a journal.  Right?  You get sent all the work.  You can then delay publishing it until people have been forced out (that's how the NZ government likes to put people or things out of business) and then pass the output off as a product of your own.  By thievery.  I mean to say.  The people who don't do the work (who don't have teh capacity to do the work) claiming all the work as their own.  Like the kids in the playground who beat up others and steal their money or lunch or clothes not because they are deprived of those material things but because they want to teach the other kids a lesson in how the other kids get to sit around clapping clapping clapping at the brilliant antics of the prime bully.  Appoint them chief of surgery chief of the chieftons who gets to decide whether the building apprentice can hit a nail in straight.  There's nothing here.  KPMG...  They are a private company?  But they rely on Government contracts.  Right?  So they are a Government company.  Because they only exist (they are only financially viable) because of the large government hand-outs.  They contract to them.  They don't share the work around.  They won't pay others to do the work.  And I guess they are a sort or kind of company where people work in pods of 6, or similar.  So you can hide the kid of the Chief of the Chieftons such that they are on payroll and they don't do any of the actual work.  They just get their name on the work outputs.  And various people...  Maybe summer interns.  Do they pay them?  Or do they work as volunteers for the charity trust.  Rattling a tin for the board of directors to build themselves a bomb shelter under the childrens hospital kind of a charity trust.  Would Warehouse Katmandu Briscoes group survive without the massive Government handouts.  The continually putting the competitors out of business.  To ensure there is no competition.  And so on.  We regard these to be private businesses.  The massive hand-outs to subsidise the aliminum smelter so that people are forced to pay more and more for the cost of electricity to further subsidide business.  So that the people of Invercargill have jobs taking toxic waste and moving it into storage facilities.  The massive handouts to further subside the supermarkets.  The refusal to ingredient list food items properly.  Fonterra wants to do business with the USA, apparently, but 'melamine' needs to be listed as an ingredient and they won't do it.  They won't shut down the milk production when contiminants are found.  They won't compensate the victims of the crimes of the New Zealand Government.
</p>

<p>Would you like to do business with New Zealand?  They burned the trade centre twice before business was going to be hosted by Microsoft Rooms.  They didn't want there to be the kind of dodgey backroom dealing where Chris Whelan has a little chat with Epstein and they decide who the special 7 year olds are who are going to be pipelined to the New Zealand Private Schools so that they can go camping over the summer holidays to entertain the tourists.  Ask yourself if it is possible to do business with a nation that doesn't have stuff all laws (apparently there is no law that could extradite kim.com for his contribution to the financial position of the New Zealand judiciary) but even when they do have laws what laws there are don't matter at all because the judges (all the way up to and including the supreme court level) refuse to uphold any of them.  You can't do business with people who don't honor their contracts etc.  When it's time to pay their workers their workers mysteriously vanish.  So you think wow what a wonderful business opportunity to make a lot of money from the slave labor situation down there...  But they need to keep burning the buildings.  I guess it's because they throw the bones into the construction sites.  I would suppose.  So the whole construction thing is really just an excuse for digging a big hole in the ground and throwing things into it and covering it up with concrete.  Plop a carpark on top, even.  Whatever.  There's nothign here.
</p>

<p>The post-modernist essay generator generates research proposals.  That shows you how easy it is to write a fundable project when the Government has already decided who to give the funding to for non-academic reasons.  You get access to the entire research output of the class that you grade.  You have 60 or 100 or 1,000 students all writing you essays on topics you choose to give to them.  You choose their grades and you choose if they get credit (and what credit they get) for the work they have been given you for you to grade.  If their work is particularly good you can fail them out and once they have gone away pass their work off as your own.  Or you could swap with someone someplace else.  They give you their studnets and you give them your studnets work.  So that the plagarism is less likely to be detected.  Princeton can take the Turnitin submissions of New Zealand, for example, and their people can traffick in that system since the Univesrity says they don't use the system at all (none of their studnets or professors, presumably) work is submitted to it.  If the online plagarism detectors are put to work then they tell the studnets they are plagarising and the acknowledge the professors.  The plagraism detectors are being used to prevent and prohibit original research only.  How do we know?  Take a look at the actual research that is produced particularly in the arts.  Indistinguishable from the post-modernist essay generator for the obvious reason that...  Else...  It reads really rather a lot like someone copy-pasted together the output of a class who wrote essays on that content.  If not the essay of one of the class members to save the professor or teacher the effort of copy-pasting together something the plagarism detector would credit them with as original.

<p>What a f*cking farce.  Indeed.
</p>

<p>At one point there was this chain letter.  The chain of citation.  You are supposed to ensure that you cite the 5 publications on the letter in your next publication.  Then you remove the name of the first person and add your name to the bottom.  You send the letter out to however many people.  Then you get cited.  If you don't play the chain of citation game then nobody will cite you and there will be no research funding for you.  Right.  That sounds like a brilliant way to fund research when the goal or the point or the purpose is the prevention and prohibition of research game.  To have articles and books that are indistinguishable from the outputs of a computer programme.  Or indistinguishable from the work of a first year student.  That's right.  The studnets can pay teh university pay teh university pay the university pay the univesrity pay teh university.  They can start paying the university when they are 18 and they can pay the university pay the university pay the university.  Then when they are over 40 they can still be paying the university paying the university paying the university.  While the university refuses to get their work to external examiners.  Refuses to process their application for programmes the student has selected to study.  The university can enrol them in programmes they never applied to making more and more and more and more money for keeping their student slave.  The studnet will die without achieving wages for full-time work.  While the research output of the people on payroll is...  Uh...  Urm...  You can't blame the journals when the university has the capacity to start a journal.  Where is the output of the university?  Where is it?  Where are all the articles and the books?  Where are the finished theses in teh library?  Where is the output?  THe governmetn keeps paying the university keeps paying teh university keeps paying the university.  To keep how many people detained in substandard accommodation for how many years?  With social pressure to join clubs and party party party with the administration.  Who wouldn't want to fly around the world putting on a silly dress with everybody clap clap clapping your every word.  Where is the research output?  What university?  Slave / prison / detention camps.
</p>

<p>So, bearing that in mind...  What do we think of the output of the Supreme Court?  That various judgements of the courts.  The output of a computer programme designed to write Judgments for nasty little despots in the Pacific Islands?  One where there actually don't need to be any judges on payroll at all because they can replace them, not by interns, writing Judgments during their student days (write the judgments now and maybe we will graduate you 10++ years from now) but with computer programmes.  Worst case, you just say they were designed to be indistinguishable from schizophrenia patient.  Right?  I mean, word salad.  Word salad.  Word salad.  That's the fall-back.  Check out the prevalence of 'special phrases' like 'there could be no evidence that would attest to that' and so on.  The copy-paste together of meaningful phrases and clauses into an overall judgement that isn't coherent at all.  I mean, when proceedings are not struck out (and the proceedings was a motion to have proceedings struck out) then the 'winner' or 'substantively correct party' is...  C'mon...  I'm sure somebody can figure that out...
</p>

<p>I mean...  Imagine a toddler.  A little kid.  Playing.  You know, you can give it a lawn mower and watch it playing.  Pretending to be mowing lawns.  It's curious becuase you learn a lot about what people think is involved in certain jobs, or whatever, when you see them playing like that.  Imagine the toddler pretending to be reading.  Sitting quietly.  Looking thoughtful.  Scrunching up the face with a bit of effort.  But it is just playing.  The observables.  Because it doesn't know how to actually read.  It doesn't know, yet, what is going on when people are actually reading.  Now imagine the toddler teaching.  Standing up in front of people who are sitting down before them.  On the floor or at tables.  They are all paying attention.  All eyes on me.  All eyes on me.  All eyes on me.  I am speaking.  I am drawing on the board.  All eyes are on me.  Pay attention to me.  Everybody.  Mememememe.  That's what teaching is.  When you are 3.  Who wants to play doctors and nurses?  Not the developed world.  Not the developed world at all.  How do you decide how to pay your workers to do what, now?
</p>

<p>Rashbrooke posted something to Stuff saying about now being middle or dark ages, intellectually or academically.  The more time I have had to sit with that notion or idea, the more correct it seems to me to be.  Yeah.  That does make sense of the...  Flavor.  The...  Climate.  The feeling.  Within Universities.  The environments feel oppressive.  The administration keeps things oppressive.  All eyes on them.  All eyes on them.  All eyes on the administration.  Better spend your time sucking up to the Administration if you want a party party party budget to go on tour in the name of conference of in the name of presenting an article you wrote or found 20 years ago...  Maybe write another article on Jane Austin as a reply or response to the essays you got from your first year class after all the eyes were on you for an hour 3x per week, or whatever it was.  Listening to you rant about your thoughts rather than teaching a range of views.  From an anthology test of standard literature in the field.  I guess that was exposing, rather, that those undergraduates of Princeton weren't selected because they were particularly articulate.  Apparently the idea/l is that the only person allowed to write in ethics is Singer.  All of the ethics research outputs for him.  Nobody else will be on payroll to do ethics.  No people in this part of the world, anyway.  The Australian Government sic the Down's Syndrome Community on him for saying that there wasn't any moral difference in our treatment of people as animals to the slaughter indeed.  The population will comply with what the Government has decided is right for you.  I mean, the leader has a PhD in Law from Harvard!!  All eyes on her!!  She will proclaim what academia has decided is right for you.  I mean...  They considered all the views there were in real time and deliberated and it was cheapest to run the experiment on New Zealanders with manufacturers liability waived in a nation where the Government will not provide the most basic of judicary.  I mean...  The process for appointing Judges (pulling them out of retirement to stamp their pawprint on judgments that sound like they got spat out of the judgment generator for third world nations).
</p>

<p>Here is a good idea for the prevention and prohibition of research output.  Take students who have achieved success at University level in their first year work, second year work, third year work, and honors year.  So they have built up (in the Arts) capacity to write about 40,000 words deemed of high enough quality for entry into the masters research or doctoral research programme.  Then, all of a sudden, the university treats them as though they are functionally illiterate and too lazy or stupid to write up to 50,000 words of high enough quality content for a masters project to be completed in 1 academic year (over 34 weeks including the examination period) or 2 academic years (to allow up to 1 year of external examination) for a doctoral project.  When the students were working to 50 minute blocks regularly in first year lecture or tutorial format.  When they were shutting their pie-holes (mostly) and being attentive to something (the lecture content) in lectures.  When they were able to write 3 hour examinations during crunch time.  The format that the students have been working to and excelling in during their undergraduate years.  Then, all of a sudden, when it comes to the production of up to 50,000 words research in 1 year or 100,000 words in, effectively 2 years, the University treats them like they lack the most basic of literacy skills.  If the student doesn't do anything anything anything anything the supervisor says for, uh, how many years?  Then the student will be tresspassed from the university and declared unemployable and functionally illiterate.  No?  That's not what happens?  For how many years did the studnet manage to post the work that was required,  by the actual deadline, into the f*cking post-box, so that it could be examined in a timely fashion?  Then, then it comes to graduate student research, they practically get the snipers in the clocktower and refuse to acknowledge receipt of thesis.  Refuse to get thesis to examiners.  Keep working keep working keep working.  If you insist on your thesis submission being your thesis submission then we don't need to send it to external examiners.  The day you submit your thesis is the day teh University decides that you are failed and deemed functionally illiterate.  We don't have Universities.  We have slave or detention camps.  NOt that put graduate studnets to work...  That put graduate studnets down.  THere will be academic jobs (also nursing jobs also medical doctor jobs also teacher jobs) over various people's dead body.  All eyes on me all eyes on me all eyes on me.  I deem what is 'literate' and what is not, what is 'plain English' and what is not.  I am good everything I do is good.  I am the only good.  Everybody else is garbage garbage garbage.  All of the things for me.  Party party party all eyes on me.  ALl eyes on me.  All eyes on me.  Who wrote Jacinda Ardern's graduation speech for Harvard?  She seemed surprised at what they had her say about abortion.  She didn't seem to know what was coming up next on the teleprompt.  That's where the Harvard Medical Graduates go when they don't want to play by the rules in the USA.  Right?  They can go do anything anything anything anything anything in New Zealand.  Perform as many abortions as they want down there.  Don't worry about the consent forms.  Don't worry if it's criminal activity.  They don't prosecute anybody down there.  Apparently the people aren't accountable for breaking the laws, because the Laws are not written in plain English.  Word salad word salad word salad.
</p>

<p>
So I'm trying to get a handle on what is going on...  Because, what I remember of David Lumsden was that he was a competent teacher.  He taught the content that he was taught when he was an undergraduate in England and a Graduate at Princeton.  So I got to read the same books that the kids get to read when they are enrolled in those Universities.  So that's something that they are working on changing, now.  Instead of me being expected to teach from an anthology of high quality articles, for example, I'm expected to teach (at Macquarie) a more conversational book.  One that is appropriate the only level of literacy that we will acknowledge from that is deemed a 'second tier' University.  I suppose that is the idea.  The pressure on Acaademics to remove the content from their classes and teach one persons conversation.  Instead of reading Plato or Locke or Kant or Quine or Russell (in translation since we don't offer or allow languages anymore) we will read the conversational outputs designed for people who the Government wants to be deemed or declared functionally illiterate.  We can have lecturers reading the conversational outputs.  Maybe the lectures that Kripke wrote.  No...  We don't want people to be able to read that kind of thing.  That's too high level.  Save that for the functionally illiterate zombie army of New York.  We want the New Zealanders watching the YouTubes.  We want them not reading anything anything anything at all.  We want them not able to hold a crayon.  Not able to type unless it's into a computer programme that will attribute to them only word salad word salad word salad.  David Lumsden was not really a producer.  But he was a competent teacher who helped students work through content or material that was genuinely difficult.  What is Grice's theory of Speaker's meaning?  Etc.  I remembered Justine Kingsbury as being sensible, I thought.  But now...  Word salad word salad word salad.  It is less clear to me why she isn't producing research.  I guess because her job is to bully the students into not producing research.  Teaching the money cow course and persuading the students that they don't speak or understand English.  They don't have the capacity for the most basic of critical thinking or reasoning.  I can't imagine that she would want to be subjected to the kinds of criticism or critique that she publically directs towards her own students, for example.  I don't know why she wrote doctoral reports of my masters thesis that was produced under her supervision.  Nobody cares if it would be better (or worse) if I were to 'keep working'.  What is relevant is whether I had 'done enough'.  I applied to be enrolled in a 120 point programme of study.  The NZVCC and TEC have approved 120 points as being 1 EFT as being up to 34 weeks of labor including the examination period.  If they are going to have 3 months of external examination (followed by up to 10 weeks of changes) then you need to submit your 120 point thesis for external examination after about 5 months.  
</p>

<p>Then it is time for you to die.  Right.  After 5 months work.  There will be a job for you over their dead body.  The University never sent my thesis submission of 14 September 2018 out to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit them signing off that I had done enough for 120 points credit from the New Zealand University Education System.  They thereby pronouce:  The New Zealand education system is completely entirely utterly lacking in honesty and completely utterly lacking in any kind of integrity whatsoever.  The Vice Chancellor pronounced that his invoices to the students are allowed to be 'fixed' by him.  There are no restrictions on the amount he requires students to pay before the University gets their thesis to examiners (or not) and also pronounced that the University has discretion to force zero fees indefinate re-enrolment (asserted by their award winning in house counsel Shelley-Slade-Gully).   The Statutory laws say the University is required to report to the Government 3 ways:  EFTS, points value, enrolment duration (number of weeks) and these are supposed to triangulate as follows: 1 EFT = 120 points = 34 weeks of enrolment (including the examination period).  It is false that the MPhil is 'not an EFTS based qualification'.  The TEC approved it as being 'right sized'.  It is listed in the f*cking University calendar as a minimum enrolment of one year.  I have confirmation that the university recieved my application to enrol in a 120 point MPhil qualification in 2018.  They have invoiced different things (things I never applied for or to) to my studnet loan.  They have invoiced differently to the New Zealand Government.  The New Zealadn Government gave them money for falsely reporting things about me.  They falsely reported that I was enrolled in various graduate research programmes that I  never even applied to be enrolled in.  The University is falsely billing.  They are sending people extortion letters or letters demaning bribe or exit payments.  They are demanding studnets pay more and more and more fees 'otherwise you will never qualify to meet the requirements for the Degree'.  Check out the letter that the University got their award winning (and very attractive) lawyer to send me.  You have up to one month to comply with demands of this letter (to reenrol and pay more fees) otherwise you will never meet the requirements for the Degree.  After I submitted my thesis for external examination (more than 3 times) they tresspass me from the Univesrity.  They are not a University.  There is nothing there.  No quality.  No integrity.  Criminal.  What do you call sending people extortion letters demanding they pay you more and more money otherwise you will refuse to credit them with the work they have done?  What a f*cking farce. 
</p>

<p>You can read for yourself my Masters thesis submissions.  You can see how the more they kept me working on it the more they kept me working on it.  It isn't obviously or clearly better.  It is just more and more and more and more work they take from me without crediting me as having done anything at all.  You can also see the use to which my thesis was put.  The previous PhD one that I have to the Australian National University as well.  That was uploaded onto USA cloud servers and so on and so forth. It used to be a criticism of psychiatry that it was a political tool of social control.  When Governments want to get rid of people who speak about their crimes they imprison them in the name of psychiatry.  They say the victims of the crimes (the ones that won't shut up about them) are guilty of word salad word salad word salad and they need to be locked up in a government institution for the rest of their days and drugged with chemical straight jacket anasthetics etc to get them to shut up about the crimes of the government.  My thesis was about how psychiatry wasn't that bad...  But, after looking into the issue, it actually seemed that much of medicine was doing the same thing, actually.  Which has come into fruition, rather, as governments around the world keep people locked up in the name of 'covid response'.  Something something about being expert led.  Making the decisions about who to keep locked up when on the basis of..  Clinical grounds?  Where the idea is to help the actual person who has been, uh, convicted, of being an affront to medicine or psychiatary?  Or political grounds?  Where the decision about who to keep locked up in the name of Covid is not made on the basis of clinical grounds at all.  Rather, it is made by governments, I suppose, to sacrifice the people for the good of themselves, primarily.  So we can watch the politicians on TV and ratings for that overtakes the ratings for a show where people get to marry the hottest nurse and the administrators daughter and do anything anything anything anything anything.  Right?  Why didn't Jacinda Ardern get an honorary degree in Medicine?  How much would one of those cost, do you think?  I suppose you do anything anything anything that mangement or the administration says (they decide who has been consented for abortion and euthanasia and they decide who has the capacity to consent).  The people can't read the contract.  No capacity to hold a crayon from their chemical straightjacket.  They gave them enough LSD so they say they have hallucination which is auditory therefore delusion word salaad word salad it must be the schizophrenia.  It's just word salad from the government.  The Universities are throwing away applications to enrol from people who are literate and of age so they can enrol children in courses that are sooooo competititive the children will do anything anything anything anything anything...  For maybe a year or two.  Before it's time for them to go (or be put) away.  That's the quality and integrity situation.  Right there.  Check out the Supreme Court Judgments and the various Judgments from 'Judges' pulled out of retirement.  The Judges don't seem to have the willingness or ability to read (or report back in your judgement) the laws that confer OBLIGATIONS to the Univerisites.  Statutes don't grant unlimited power to the Universities.  They set out their duties and obligations to the people.  The Statute says quite clearly domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are ELIGIBLE to be enrolled in whatever programme they have applied to.  The University believes they have the discretion to enrol 14 year old Vietnamese studnets in Finance Degrees (AUT).  The University believes they have the discretion to keep billing for studnets who are rotting in their residential halls.  Literally.  There's nothing here...

I guess the idea/l of the plain writing bill is something to do with Google approving or not approving a document on the basis of things like (1) the only words to appear in the document are in the list of ones approved as being of a certain 'reading level'.  Then there will be structural requirements that make it easy for a computer to randomly generate something within those parameters but something next to impossible for people.  That means that people won't be able to submit documents or have documents accepted.  Instead, there will just be word salad word salad word salad.  With all the meaning taken out.  They won't be seen to be burning the books or removing the informational contents.  Particularly with biology the idea is to overwhelm with random facts so that the amount of content is unstructured, not meaningful, not something that people can use to make inferences from etc.  So then the people on pay-roll as doctor are only allowed to type in the patient symptoms and then the computer programme can output the 'treatment plan' where as many people die as quickly as possible because final solution is maximally efficient!  But more importantly, that's what 'being kind' meeeeeeeeeans.  Anybody who doesn't understand that doing what the government says when the government says  because the government says is what it meeeeeeeeans to 'be kind' simply doesn't understand what it meeeeeeeeans to 'be kind'.  Sacrificing yourself for the increased benefits to those who already have every advantage in life is what it meeeeeeeans to 'be kind'.  Giving Chris Hipkins one more portfolio (just one more, Chris,  nobody else is capable of doing anything anything anything at all) is what it meeeeeeeans to be kind.  Immunising the young males (partiuclarly the ones who aren't allowed to vote) otherwise denying them a livlihood where they aren't likely to find themselves concreted into the foundations of a new build or a mine, I suppose is what it meeeeeeeeeeeans to be kind.  One for the team.  Whose team?  The team of... How many people are there in government, again?  How many people paid enough to keep a harem (or an entire third world island, or an entire school, or an entire hospital, or an entire aged care facility)...  Allllllll of the money for them!!!  Be kind New Zealand!  YOu are illiterate and you can't do math!!! Nothing you say is of the government approved format!!!!  Time to die!! That's what it meeeeeeeans be 'be kind' in the naaaame of maaaaaaximall  efficiency!!

Read for yourself the computer generated garbage output of the courts.  I don't think we can Habeus Corpus the named judges.  The people whose signatures are on the judgment.  I mean to say.  Get them to appear before the physical court.  Make sure they aren't dead in a government dungeon.  Hiding in a bomb shelter under a childrens hospital.
</p>

<p>When I was a student at the University of Waikato (before I started my PhD with the Australian National University)...  So...  Sometime before 2006...  The Philosophy Department had a talk by a speaker who was a PhD student.  I think he was enrolled in Linguistics - but I am not certain.  It is possible that he was enrolled in Law.  He was Maaori.  His thesis was about Treaty of Waitangi interpretation from the perspective of translation in Linguistics.  I thought it was a really good talk.  I learned a lot about translation from the perspective of linguistics, and what he was saying about soverignty seemed good to me, too.  I wonder what happened to him?  I do remember, as an Undergraduate, having a bit to do with Maaori students.  Particularly in Psychology they would have Maaori tutorials that anybody who wanted could go along to.  One of the students I studied with the most was Maaori (he actually got money from the Government for 'The Hub' which was a place for youth offenders where the idea was to provide assistance to them to help them into apprenticeships and so on). Don't know what happened to him or that place.  I can't imagine that it hasn't been taken over by psychopaths or sociopaths by now.  They want the kids to be pipelined to prostitution and prison.  They don't want the kids to have the help that they need, really.  Here is a Hub and there is a Hub and everywhere a Hub Hub...  Hub is what you call something when all of the money goes to administration and anybody on the 'front lines' are disposable canon fodder who pay you while they do all the work in the faint hope that one day you will sign off on thier qualification completion or pay them money for pimping the children out, or similar.  Anyway...  I wonder what happened to that guys thesis?  I'm seeing a bit, now, about people within Law who spend 10++++ years of Law PhD's about Treaty Interpretation.  I suppose the Maaori guy got bullied into fleeing the University without his PhD and insofar as his thesis wasn't entirely redacted  by the University they would lhave passed it on, else sold it on, to someone over in Law.  That's my bet.  I remember the Waikato Maaori were fairly skeptical about quite a few things.  Maaori being taught in the University quite differently from how it was on the Marae.  Quibbles about pronounciation (regional variation) and spelling  (e.g, 'aa' - when it was the Europeans who decided to write it with English letters to make it easy for the English speakers to gain control over the Maaori language).  Skeptical about the Maaori who go to Auckland in order to study land law in order to obtain land in order to subdivide the land and sell it to wealthy europeans for their own profits.  Political Maaori selling out the people in exchange for their own personal power.   
</p>

<p>I don't remember what Tim Dare used to write about, in Philosophy.  But I don't think that promotion (to Professor) or research funding was forthcoming for him until he agreed to publish in the New Zealand Medical Students Journal (to take up space in the print publication so that a Medical Student would not have their work published) and, more particularly, until he started giving ethics approval (in his capacity as a Philosophy person who does work on Law and Ethics) to write about how the Government uplifts of the Children into State Care (and the identification of them as 'vulnerable' for the purposes of recording how they are pipelined into government institutions who will record them as failures and deprive them of resources and livlihoods only).  WHen you write about how it's practically morally obligatory to identify the 'vulnerable children' (for their own good) so that you can ensure that they are fed to bullies and abusers on government payroll...  Well, when you start doing that...  That's when you find yourself on government payroll.  Huzzah!!
</p>

<p>Still...  I suppose Tim Dare doing ethics (and being paid for writing about how the Government is practically morally obliged to take children they choose as 'vulnerable' and ensure they are pipelined to bullies and abusers because nobody expects (nobody will allow) any different for them)...  Is...  Progress?  Developmental progress in ethics for New Zealand?  Developmental progress from Alister Gunn who used to party party party with the girls from the local girls High School in the name of 'Philosophy in the Schools'.  He had a University of Waikato catering budget for 'entertainment', I believe.  I do remember going to semi-formal parties at his house on boxing day when I was an undergraduate.  I believe the Vice Chancellor was there?  Alister's wife was somethign something high up in the Administration??  He had a batch at raglan..  And there was this girl enrolled in Law and Philosophy...  Her first name was Kelly.  I don't remember her last name.  He used to take her with him to conference and deliver apparently co-authored talks with her..  From when she was a second year student, I believe.  That's the main reason why I stayed away from studying Law.  Because she was fairly well known...  She would do Norml protests smoking dope at the court house and the like.  Environmental law interest.  When people heard my name was Kelly and I was studying Philosophy they thought I was her -- until I could tell them that I did not work on Ethics with Alister -- I worked on Philosophy of Mind with David Lumsden.  I did not study Law.  I studied Psychology.  I never went to any conferences with faculty from Waikato.  I went to student conferences with a fellow PhD student only.  Kelly was supposed to come with us one year - but she bailed from delivering her own talk by herself.  Last I heard from her I found her in a pub in Armedale.  About to board a Greenpeace boat to someplace.  Apparently one of the Mothers of the girl found an inappropriate message from him on her daughters cellular answer phone.  She complained to the University.  Then some of the people employed in Philosophy started saying that something needed to be done about him.  They tolerated him when he was younger, but what was he, now, pushing 60?  Older?  Party party partying with the girls in the High Schools.  C'mon.  Anyway, the administration worked only to cover things up.  Then they prounounced that he died so everything would be dropped.  I wonder where he is, now?  Probably redeployed to the Gold Coast?  Probably.  They probably wrote him a glorious reference about how he was most valued member of staff (the administration just loved him) but they needed to move him along because he turned out to be a pedophile.  Or maybe not...  I think 16 is the legal age of consent in New Zealand, so, not technically a pedophile.  Abusing his position.  I suppose it would have been soooooo competitive the girls would have done anything anything anything anything anything for a reference for their application to college.  Else they could have recorded on their transcript that they failed a first year ethics course from the University of Waikato.  I mean, who fails a first year ethics course from the University of Waikato?  What are they?  A sexual offender that they can't even pass a first year ethics course from the University of Waikato? 
</p>

<p>I can't remember her name...  Pauline something or other?  Hansen?  I don't remember her name.  She was employed in Education.  Her PhD was on prostitution.  She was writing about how new recruits are educated by the older prostitutes.  She was given funding to road trip around the USA and do 'undercover' interviews and so on.  There was an article that actually made it into Nexus (student magazine) at some point.  She refused to give a Law student their first year essay back.  This was when essay return was usual, typical, standard, so you get comments on your essay telling you why you got the grade you did and what concrete changes would have resulted in a better grade so that you could improve your performance if you chose to invest in your educational development a bit more next time.  Anyway, she withheld the grade also the essay and said the student needed to go to her office to collect it.  When the student arrived she was getting changed (in front of her) and trying to encourage her to go with her to do research.  She complained about her...  I think she did go.  Probably she got promoted and she's now in Melbourne.
</p>

<p>Not functioning Universities, at all.  It wasn't the first time that she withheld a studnet's essay for a little 'one on one time' on threat of giving bad grades or failing grades if the student wouldn't do anything anything anything.  I can't work out whether Sterelny's problem with me was that I declined to house-sit for him (the second time he asked me to do it) or whether it was something else.  He didn't ask Rachael or Nick to house-sit for him.  He didn't ask Daniel Stojlar or Dave Chalmers to housesit for him.  He didn't put a f*cking add in the f*cking paper and offer to pay someone to house-sit for him.  Apparently they are all dreaming of Kripke...  How his studnets (ones he refused to sign off on, I suppose) apparently or allegedly loved him soooooooo much...  That they would literally physically carry  him to class...
</p>

<p>Not functioning Universities.  Apprarantly the political 'debates' are...  Well...  The politicians think that their 'question time' (where you look in the direction of Tova and make some comment about needing to spread your legs) is 'political debate'.  Were they decide who gets to attend (vs who gets locked up in jail in the name of them being not fit to stand trial because they must  be intellectually handicapped because they must  be autistic the government can't even hear them when they speak!) and who gets to ask questions.  Who is not allowed to ask a question.  The name calling and the 'putting in the naughty corner' and the squabble and so on...  They think that is academia...  They are really well versed in academia, our politicians.  They've been trained to take turns speaking and they've been trained in professionalism and they've been trained.  No, uh, they haven't.  Anti-intellectual.  But that's okay, they can just take all the honorary degrees and qualifications for themselves and prounounce that they are the educational elite.  Anything they say is literate (any words they don't understand go on the 'not plain english' list of words and phrased.  Ideas...)  We don't have a functioning democracy.  Don't worry...  These people decide whether you have been consented for Ethanasia etc.  They decide.  They know.  They are soooo knowledgeable the only people who are allowed to enrol and graduate are people who teach what these people have said.  Like the state of anatomy when God had written a textbook.  If you saw things that weren't in Gods textbook you had faulty eyes.  The government knows everything.  What level of risk and what job you must have and whether you get to be locked up.  Look at the products of their labors!  look at the fruits of their work!  A joyous Westworld land for all the Pedophiles of the world to come and do whatever they want to zonbie's with no value.  They aren't people.  They can't read, write, do arithmetic.  They have no meaning or value.  Nothing.  Just empty blow up dolls to clap clap clap and sing the praises of the policians.
</p>

<p>Were people *jealous* of Hitler?  I suppose some people were / are.  They would like to be God of the Virgins.  Or of some island where they get to make the laws and break the laws and do anything anything anything because they are the only person that there is.  There aren't any other people.  Just blow up doll puppets or slaves.  Yeeeeeees.  The problem with people with autism (who don't have any of their speakings acknowledged) is that they don't have any empathy.  Riiiiiiight.  That's the problem with autistics.
</p>

<p>When Jane Kelsey gave me a 'First in Class' for First Year Law with the University of Auckland I did know, at that time, that I had been picked out, by her, as someone who she wanted to spend years and years and years and years and years and years and years doing anything anything anything anything anything everything she says for as long as she says  because she says.  Right?  I mean...  There is no way that I would have gone to any kind or sort of 1:1 meeting with her.  That's what it meeeeeeeeeeans to be picked out or identified as 'special' in New Zealand.  The whole 'tall poppy syndrome' thing of how people are expected to keep their heads down and huddle in with herds, if they know what is good for them.  Then only the pedophiles or the sexual abusers or those who abuse or misuse their positions to profit themselves for their own personal advantage will be promoted.  Right?  I mean...  The Fire Economy stuff is interesting...  But, how many years ago, now, did people sort out what was going on with that in the USA.  Why are we continually forced to 'get in behind' and follow...  However many f*cking years behind.  F*cking always.  Because the USA is a nation and culture in decline.  Because Harvard, for example, is too busy going around trying to cut everything and everyone else off at the knees rather than being focused on creating something that is genuinely valuable.  To be fair, Harvard attracts a certain 'kind' or 'type' and, I suppose, it's nice to have a beacon like that to draw those kinds of people some place in particular..  Then you can shoot them down off the coast of Rhode Island.  They can move to New York to make 'Friends' and find it's sooooooooooo competitive they are all clamboring over each other for a space in someone's basement...
</p>

<p>When the Population Health people gave me 30 per cent for my first essay and said that I needed to go and speak with someone over there 1:1 and I declined (saying anything they wanted to say to me, they would write down so that there was a formal record of the conversation) and they failed me out of the course because I wouldn't do anything anything anything anything. I mean, it was sooooooooo competitive.  First year Population Health.  I mean, there wasn't a seat for every university studnet enrolled in the course on the bus to get out to Tamaki to attend class.  The University knows how many studnets enrolled in the course.  The University knows what residential hall the studnets are living in.  The University knows how many studnets are expected to be on the bus from the central campus to Tamaki to attend the lecture at a certain time on Tamaki Wednesdays.  The University chose to not send enough buses and be all like 'ooooooooh you better get in there!  you better trample your fellow studnets for a place on the bus!  oooooooh you better squash yourself or the person next to you into the bag rack.  ooooooh you better not miss the bus!!  you better not miss the bus to Tamaki!  it's soooooooo competitive!  The 18 year old first years will do anything anything anything for a place in Meidcine.  Look at how they will do anything anything anything!  push each other into the bag racks to make sure they get on the bus!!!!  Keep the bums on the seats for Population Health Wednesdays!'  Then the bus goes...  80ks/hr on the Motorway.  No?  It would be dangerous to hold up the flow of traffick...
</p>

<p>The problem is that the University of Auckland doesn't have enough money.  The Government doesn't pay them enough for the Population Health Students to have a seat on the bus to get from their University residential hall to the compulsory class for their Degree programme that they were enrolled in.  The problem is that there isn't enough money.  Yeah, right.  The problem is that someone decided that it would be a good idea to teach these kids a lesson in what had already been decided for them.  That's the state of the New Zealand Universities.  When people are ready for the Glue Factory is when they are sent to Professor Glue from Otago.  Chortle chortle snort.  It's sooo..  Ironic?  It's blatant.  The way the Nazi's would play triumphant music when they marched the people into the gas chambers.  When you have been asisgned to the Glue Factory.  That's the state of psychological medicine at Otago.  The state of population or public health at Auckland.  Are we really expected to believe that Ashley Bloomfield did his time in First Year population health out at Tamaki Wednesdays?  No...  He did a...  Was that a 120 point 2 year Masters (because he doesn't have the capacity to work full time?)
</p>

<p>Everybody knows that the public defenders job is to read the little note on the file that indicates whether the defendent has been identified as a 'career criminal' by the government (to be kept in prison), or not.  I'm sure the judges get the same memo.  Then there is a spectical or farcicle parade (much like parliament under the reign of the speaker of the house who treats the politicians the way that most people honestly don't even treat their 'naughty toddler') and the verdict (decided already, in the memo) is announced.  If the defendent won't play along and sign the confession written  by the police, or read the confession written by the lawyer, then the 'medical profession' can be hauled in to pronounce that the person isn't allowed to appear before a jury or isn't allowed to appear in an open court room 'for their own good' or 'because they are not fit to stand trial'.  Hey.  Why not just give up the farcical farce.  We don't have a functioning judiciary.  No actual lawyer is going to do public defender work (no actual judge is going to write judgments) no actual medical doctor is going to declare someone isn't allowed to publically defend themselves in the face of allegations against them.  No actual academic is going to sign off on all and only those who get off on this pathetic little facade.  What a f*cking joke.  Show the people the toxicology screen...  The drugs the Glue Factory people (the only ones the government would put on psychiatry payroll) the LSD and the anesthetics (that don't make you feel less pain while they are abusing you that only immobalise you and then make you claim to have forgotten that they abused you in fact) and the old generation anti-psychotics that were praised as chemical straight jackets in the management of patients.  Hey, I know, you should drug the entire population until nobody nobody nobody at all has any questions for the government.  What would you hvae to put in the water for the most compliant popluation in the world?  What would you have to put in the water for a population that would sing the praises of Hitler while the only people on Government payroll sing triumphant songs while they march the people off to be exterminated?  What would you have to feed the people for the level of compliance in the face of restrictions that  happened in New Zealand?  I mean...  Check out the riots etc in other nations.  In the USA people with guns stormed parliament.  But the US government did not restrict the movement of the people the way the NZ Government did.  The NZ Government took more freedoms from the people than the government of anywhere else in teh supposedly 'free world' and in response the people...  WEre soooooo used to being abused and ignored and oppressed by the government that..  Yawn.  Business as usual.  That is to say no business.  You can't do business with a nation that doesn't have a fucntionign judiciary.  Go blackbird for slaves...  Uh...  Where?  Pay you later...  Maybe next generation.  But only if you pop out for us a violent sexual offender to put on our payroll.

The Government has got protestors out, today.  I wondered a bit, what the government meant, when they were dismissive about the Wellington protestors (when they locked up Tamaki) by accusing them of being funded or seeded, or whatever, from overseas.  They seemed to think that they were not representative of anything within New Zealand so they did not need to listen to any of the things they were saying or come out and dialogue or take questions from those people.  But, I suppose it makes sense,  now, of the various protests that the government is paying for or seeding or whatever.  So that it gives out the message that the government is tolerant of political protest and dissent.  They won't lock up everybody who is 'protesting'.  No.  They will pay for people to 'protest' and campaign for things that they don't think matter, at all. I mean, who cares whether or not Australaian Aboriginal people are written into the constitution of Australia?  Apparently some segment of the Aboriginal Community believe that it will only be used as a pretext for further ill treatment of the Aboriginal people.  New Zealanders are written into the constitution of Australia and look how Australia treats New Zealanders.  As criminals.  Refuses to supply them with federal voting papers etc etc.  What a f*cking farce.
</p>

<p>
Apparently Chris Whelan is trying to arrange a strike of University employees.  I suppose that is because Chris Whelan feels  he needs a pay rise.  I mean, he needs to buy his own personal phone and his own personal flights around the world to blackbird for students for the New Zealand education system.  Poor poor Chris Whelan.  I don't suppose it would make terribly much of a difference who, in particular, screens the Animal Planet or re-runs of lectures recorded 5 years ago, or organises for youtube videos or breaking off into pairs or groups and teaching each other.  The institution whose primary function is research...  I'm still looking for their research output.  Where is the research?  My MA thesis should have a hardcopy that I lodged in the University library and in the Philosophy Department.  The one that should be in the Philosophy Department is not there.  Somebody has removed it.  I don't know about the library one.  Where is your research Justine Kingsbury?  Where is  your research various people in the Research School of the University?  Your first year studnets produce more research than you.  Where is your work?  How will you take strike action when they pay you, and you don't really do anything...  
</p>

<p>
No surprises the ministries don't write in plain English that they took all the money out and did a bunch of busy-work.  Apparently the problem is that they studied English at the Univerisity and they are writing poems or novels or imitating Shakespeare or Chauser in their government reports.  The problem isn't that they studied marketing or management or con-munications and the only people given the degrees (the only people given the government jobs) were the people who agreed to take all of the money out for a bunch of busy-work.  So they could have enough money to hire a pool boy or a gardner or maybe a little french au pair.  Keep a few students out the back to carry their groceries.  The problem is that they need to take Shakespeare and Dickens out of the curriculum and replace it with 'telling the story' where we have meeting after meeting after meeting after meeting telling the story about how nobody is allowed to complete research in a timely fashion.  Not on our watch.
</p>

<p> 23 September 1:45pm
</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a University.  Let's call it 'University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill'.  And it offered a 'student exchange' situation where student from another University, let's call it 'The Australian National University' could go to the USA and NC would fund the student with a US stipend for one year.  In return the student was granted permission to audit (attend lectures and tutorials for no course credit) PhD level courses in the graduate school and the student was to teach one course per semester which was comparable to the UNC students.  I thought it was a good thing for UNC to do for an Australain student since Australaia will not develop graduate level teaching curriculum.  Will not do it.  Will not employ people to teach graduate level courses or classes.  They put them to work writing research without teaching them broadly, across the field or discipline.  I got the opportunity to learn from a range of different academics during my time in North Carolina.  Australasia will not employ a range of different academics.  Will not do it.  I got to study courses across a range of different aspects or areas of Philosophy.  Australasia will not employ people to do that work.  Won't do it.  
</p>

<p>What was in it for North Carolina?  They invested in...  Well, I think maybe 5 different students?  Maybe 4?  Across or over 4 years.  So, I suppose they funded a PhD student place (is one way of looking at it) without graduating a student.  They were adding one year to a student's PhD enrolment in an Australian Programme.  They were not producing a new graduate.  If that makes sense.  It was during my time there (or maybe a bit before, actually) that the Australian economy really took off and the US started being hit hard by a recession.  The Australian dollar overtook the Canadia.  The ANU had a lot of Post-Doctoral Fellowships.  They would fund a student for 3 years for a post-doc, or 2 years for a post-doc.  They were moving more and more into offering 1 year post-docs.  Professors woudl get a project funded with funding for a post-doc (1 per year) built into the project.  So they would employ students to work as a post-doc.  They were hiring students for post-doc positions from MIT (e.g., Andy Egan) and so on...  Or sometimes they were hiring people with tenured positions.  I don't remember quite how Brit got post-doc funding even when she was Tenured, I believe...  Anyway...  
</p>

<p>I think a couple of students (ones from wealthier families) were self-funding trips to Australia in the hope that that would make it more likely they would get a post-doc.  A few people came out from UNC, Chapel Hill, I believe.  I suppose that was the idea of it.  Seeing about some kind of return on the investment that UNC had made in the ANU.  UNC was having trouble finding jobs for their graduates to go into because the economy had taken a turn.  They were saying no new hires at the University.  At the University everyone earning over a certain amount had taken pay cuts so that nobody would need to be laid off.  I was told they were thinking of not funding an ANU student anymore because that was funding they could use to support one of their own students for another year.
</p>

<p>Hey, that's a good idea.  How about you withhold graduation from your student.  Then you can get them to keep working as a student.  Hey, why not just keep sending them invoices or bills that they should pay the University they should pay the university they need to pay the university just never stop paying the University.  Let's get everybody doing courses for non-credit.  Because it's all about who gets the credit and who gets the pay check -- right?  You don't need to do a range of courses when you job is to hit 'play' on animal planet.
</p>

<p>The Khan Academy American History stuff is interesting.  How people had a tendancy to die of malaria when it was time for them to be paid.  When they got to the end of their endentured servitude apprenticeship it was time for them to go away.
</p>

<p>
There's nothing there.
</p>

<p>
I imagine the problem is likely to be that they paid Professor Martin Davies hundreds of thousands of dollars to research delusions for 3 years and to employ, was it, 1 post-doctoral fellow per year, for 3 years...  And what research output was there for their investment?  I was there as a summer scholar and I produced a 40 minute talk.  I don't know where the write-up of that talk is now, or whether I emailed it to (whether I was asked to email it to) Martin Davies.  But I know he refused to write me a reference in return for the work that I had done for him on the ARC funded project that he recieved hundreds of thousands of dollars on.  I don't know what work Andy Egan published in his one year funded post-doctoral fellowship on the project.  He went from MIT to...  Rutgers?  I think  he is professor there, now...  I don't know what work he did during his 1 year post-doctoral fellowship at the ANU on the ARC funded project on delusions.  Professor Martin Davies had already done some work on the topic.  So it makes sense that giving him the research funding was paying him for work he had already done?  Perhaps.  Perhaps that is true.  So in that case it wouldn't be very fair to ask what work he produced during his time that he was ARC funded hundreds of thousands of dollars with funding for a post-doctoral fellow each year.  It wouldn't be fair to ask how my research output on the topic over the summer school and the 2 years of MA enrolment that Waikato had me working (for $5,000 scholarship) so that my 50,000 word thesis (only) would be sent out for examination as a masters thesis (only).  Where I submit in November and end February they...  Still haven't sent it out for external examination?  I needed to have left NZ physically before they would send it out for external examination, even.  And then they never did put the thesis in the Philsoophy Department.  Corruption.  Hey.  There's nothing there.
</p>

<p>Huh.  I remember now.  Andy Egan liked to party!  At some point he came out to Australia (just doing a visit well after the post-doc) with his fiance in tow?  Fiance, was she?  His studnet.  I think.  One of his female studnets.  Was she a Rutgers student? Or maybe she was Princeton or New York...  They drive around a bit, those parts.  She was a student somewhere or some place.  I think he brought her to the ANU over the summer because it was such a great place to do research?  Because she was getting near the end of her PhD.  You know...  Around the time when the students will do anything anything anything anything for sign off because it's soooooooo competitive...  I wonder whatever happened with or to her.  If she has a career in minding his babies or if he decided to pursue other plans...  Was she allowed a career of her own?  C'mon...  People watch TV.  They know the only source of power for women is Jane from MadMen or Whoever it was that married Godfrey on Game of Thrones..  That's what they want from their women...  That's how they would be women if they were women, eh?  That's right...  It's coming back to me now.  Her research thesis was on what it meant for women to have control of their own sexuality, or similar.  Every guys porn fantasy type of thing.  That was what her supervisors wanted to be hearing.  I suppose...  I repeat..  There's nothing here...
</p>

<p>How low will the National Party have to go in order to make Jacinda Ardern appear...  Uh..  Most desirable.  *There is no alternative*.  That's the idea/l.  That's what democracy meeeeeeeeeeans.  You have to say it like that.  Anybody who doesn't see that Jacinda is most kind (taking along her very own child, supposedly, as an offering to the UN) doesn't understand what it meeeeeeeans to be kind.  Everybody knows that what it is for a person to be kind is to do what someone else says when they say because they say.  Careful, now, or you'll find yourself consented for something like.  I don't know...  Suicide.  Death of their own volition.  Clearly.  That's what volition meeeeeeeans.  Euthanasia.  You have been consented.  What is so hard to understand?  I don't think Max Rashbrooke gets the extent of the situation, yet.  It isn't that the Government wants to be fair or just or share the work around.  It is that the government wants to proclaim everybody except for themselves as functionally innumerate and illiterate and incompetent and not even competent to speak.  Oh my, the entire population has been hit by teh autism.  No voting papers because they can't even sign their own name.  That's why it just looks like the VC of the various Universities are taking the 'students' voting papers and...  Uh, voting for megapornuploads of kim.com to be president of everything!  Garbage garbage garbage output.  Garbage garbage nonsense.  Nothing to see, people.  No judiciary.  No healthcare system.  No education system.  Nobody home.  I mean...  LIsten to the parliament question time.  Listen to the f*cking Ashley Bloomfield show.  Seriously?  I'm not jealous.  Was anybody actually jealous of Hitler?  Yes.  People were.  MOst beloved of the charasmatic leaders.  People would do anything anything anything anything anything.  That's what it meeeeeeans to be kind.  Right?  Without reason.  
</p>

<p>When Jacinda Ardern took her honorary degree from Harvard Shaggy took an honorary degree from Brown.  So they could sing 'wasn't me' at graduation.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_x6QmuJdms  all the time that the University...  Was filming me...  Everyone.  For their arsebook.  Of course.  Best sense...  Best sense...  Best sense...  I'm sorry...  Where is the credit for my work?  Ooooh.  I no speak-y the English.  I see.  So most rapey can be appointed Chief of Surgery chieftons of the administration of management.  Or be on payroll therefore.  So motivating and inspiring.  For sure.
</p>

<p>Oh.  It was the singularity.  For people maybe not following along so well.  There was never any better reason to believe in the singularity than 'wasn't me'.  Drunk driving?  Wasn't me.  And so on.  Read the note in the patient file that the patient had been consented for euthanasia.  Administered the drug.  Wasn't me.  The singularity made me do it.  No administration.  No management.  No generals.  Nobody in command.  Just following orders.  Orders from whom?  Why, the singularity, of course.  Never was there any better reason to believe in the singularity as the root (cause, responsible agent) of all the ills and harms and so on and so forth that there are and that there is in the world.  The singularity.  Of course.  It isn't that people do wrong.  It is that they are so very very very good at falling over each other fighting to be the first in line to obey the singularity.  Of course.  That's the nature of the problem.  Sure.  Of course it is.  Professor Glue isn't responsible for the final solution of the people deemed worthy of psychological services in Otago or New Zealand.  The singularity made him do it.  Of course.  And if he wouldn't do it then Dr Leeks or hundreds upon thousands of studnets would have been chewing each others arms off in order for them to get to do it.  Sure.  Of course.  Don't you love the motivational and inspirational ideology.  Don't you want to join them?  Wouldn't you do anything anything anything?  Not do anything anything in order to be or become a doctor or a lawyer or a nurse or a teacher...  But anything anything anything (be granted titles of doctor, lawyer, teacher) in order for you to do anyting anything.  I mean, the things that you have to do to do a little torturing of the innocent, a litlte wrongful deathbringing, these days.  You have to put on a show of being a doctor or a teacher or a lawyer.  You have to scrape up a few publications that you found from somewhere or paid others to write for you in order to get to to anything anything.  There aren't any doctors or lawyers or teachers or whatever.  Because the pedophiles and the wrongful deathbringers thought that they were making tehm look bad.  So they bullied them into fleeing.  Volunteering for suicide or euthanasia if things were going well for the wrongful deathbringing pedophiles.  Sure.  Of course.  Uh...  Where is my credit for the work that I have done?  All heil the Rt Honorable Jacinda Ardern!!!   For all the work she has done marketing New Zealand as a destination for medical graduates wanting to breed designer babies (knock out babies) that they can retrieve early (raise them in Fisher and Paykel incubators) and train to be boys to be girls...  You only want one bull or stallion in the herd, you see.  And so the rest of the boys..  Can pretend to be girls.  Else they can go off to die for their country.  Uh.  To fight for their country.  What does their country supply them with to make that a fair fight?  Uh...  yeah.  Right.  Just of you go now.  That's kind.  Very kind of you good sir...
</p>

<p>So the University likely has me picking my nose on file.  I'm sure they do.  Served up for some alumni, or whatever.  Maybe they go sharsies on whatever needs to be paid to the Univesrity in order for them to give the studnet good enough grades for the student to be enrolled in another year of univesrity accommodation.  Or maybe the University thinks that they can fail them and send a bill to the students and their parents will pay some kind of hostage fee or something...  I don't quite know how that goes.  How that works.  I don't know how much money you would need to pay Harvard in order to get to rape this one or that one...  Maybe they send out a price list at the start of the Semester.  I don't know.  Richard..  I don't remember his last name.   Nuclear Physics.  He was English.  Something somethign about him not living at University House anymore.  Something something about him being caught filming studnets at University House.  The girls.  Putting his cellpone or using mirrors or whatever and his cellphone to film them in the showers and the toilets and uploading that to the University Cloud Server.  The Cloud server so that studnets could do work from the residential halls.  They would put games and films and music...  But apparently it was mostly a Porn Hub.  Of course.  I didn't look..  But by the sounds of it it contained footage that students were uploading that they had taken of other students.  So, of course, it's all kept very hush hush.  I don't know...  They said something about him liking the Malasians...  So maybe he wasn't filming me, particularly.  But...  Just so as you know.  Before you think about whether you want to go into University accommodation.  Since they hush things up in order to protect the offender (the asset they perceive to be most valuable to them).  
</p>

<p>That is why I didn't want to take a look at Knox, in Dunedin.  Shared bathrooms.  I was over shared bathrooms.  Of course there are pinhole cameras and the like.  You just have to get used to the idea that you are a cat kept in a public cat cage for however many years.  According to Shelley Slade Gully the University can keep you enrolled under 'zero fees' indefinately while the Univesrity says your thesis is under examination.  Of course, also according to Shelly Slade Gully the University can refuse to send your thesis out at all if you aren't paid up on your studnet fees.  And Squiggley Tops (my affectionate name for Quigley because he's so squirmy like a wormy) thinks that the Law gives him authority to 'fix' (as in make up not as in correct) studnet invoices however he likes.  He refuses to acknowledge that the Statutory Requirement is for him to report to the GOVERNMENT their information 3 ways:  (1) EFTS (2) Points value (3) enrolment.  Where it is expected that 1 EFT = 120 points = 34 weeks including the examination period.  Out of time Squggley tops.  Time is up.  How many years of enrolment are your Chinese students kept enrolled for in order to earn their...  Was it a 5 year double Degree from Waikato (while residing in China)?  Was it 10 years for a double Degree from Waikato (while residing in China)?  Was it indefinate detention and melamine is not an ingredient and people just die and we don't know why and we don't know why they can't do math and we don't know why they don't understand that it takes an entire lifetime of work to be deemed too stupid to complete 3 years of research within many generations of...  
</p>

<p>And what are you going to do about it?
</p>

<p>Well.  Your response to the problem is your legacy.  Not even a tiny teeny smidgen of 'try'.
</p>

<p>24 September.
</p>

<p>TODO:  Upload the complaint that I sent to the Vice Chancellor of the Australian National University and the response that I received from the University so that the reader can see for themselves how the University responds to student complaints.  Also how they refuse to accept evidence and engage only in a process of gaslighting the complainant.
    </p>

<p>TODO:  Upload the responses that I have received from the Court of Appeal asserting that none of my cases (Roe vs University of Waikato, Roe vs University of Auckland, Roe vs University of Otago, Roe vs New Zealand Vice Chancellor's Committee) are cases of public interest.  That way you can see for yourself how they have a template that they use to assert that the cases are not cases of public interest.  The Court of Appeal thinks that it is appropriate to... Fillibuster??  Take a look at cases that were deemed to be of public interest.  Extradition of kim.com being one.  Apparently that was a case of public interest.  The refusal of New Zealand Universities to process applications to enrol (e.g., to programmes like Medicine and Law), refusal to acknowledge progression through the qualification (e.g., to get theses that have been submitted for examination out to external examiners), their refusal to allow the externals to sign off on completion of thesis requirements (if and only if the thesis is of internationally accepted standards) by refusing to supply them with sign off forms, refusing to supply them with the students updated thesis, refusal to base the outcome of examination on reports of examiners (demanding payment for extra-time fees routinely as a matter of course), refusal to handle complaints about serious wrongdoing in how they are invoicing studnet fees to the student and to the government, refusal to handle complaints about serious wrongdoing in how they are handling thesis submissions.  All of these things...  None of them interest the public at all, apparently.  It is not a matter of public interest that Chris Whelan has refused to acknowledge that he has received any complaint of wrongdoing (except for mine which he saw fit to quash only).  None of these things are matters of public interest.  None of these things will be prosecuted as criminal (there are various things in teh vicinity including misuse of official documents (e.g., thesis submissions) and so on).  It is pretty clear to everyone, I would suggest or suppose, that the Universities are not Universities at all.  They are functioning as slave or detention camps.  They are not following their own regualations when it comes to handling studnet enrolments, progressions thorough training, and sign off.  
</p>

<p>Apparently 'cosyism' is the problem.  Perhaps...  The issue, really, however, is to ask whether the pedophile was hired to do one on one 'work' in the schools -- becuase he was related to the principle...  Or whether the pedophile was hired to do one on one 'work' in the schools -- because he was a pedophile.  I think the problem is the later rather than the former.  That is or means to say I don't think that people are prioritising their family members particularly or in particular.  I think it is more that people are waiting until the references come in saying that the guy is a pedophile or wrongful deathbringer or whatever.  Or, at the very very least, that there is sufficient documentation to show that they are going to be quiet about such things.  That seems to be the thing of it.  That was the point of having the only Pacifica in that firm be drunkenly harrassing the interns.  Right?  So that the senior partners could assess which of the interns were pretending to ignore the situation (at the very least) or, ideally, which of the interns would play the role of harrassing the interns going into the future.  That's how they decide who is going to make judge.  Right?  That's how they ensure the lack of functioning judiciary?  That's how they work towards their goal or normalising sexual violence and so on in New Zealand society.  Isn't it?
</p>

<p>All the way back when Helen Clarke went to the UN and explained about how it was that New Zealand had normalised really high rates of child violence and abuse (including sexual) with very high rates of suicide.  Quite the destination for people to send their beloved children to be educated in what it is that they value.  Not a matter of public interest (domestically or internationally) at all.  Clearly.  The UN instructed New Zealand to have an inquiry into abuse in state care.  The New Zealand government and judiciary has been kicking and screaming about that every step of the way.  It will not value the lives of the victims who it has decided are good enough for the Glue Factory (Professor Glue Factory haha get it?) only.  It will not compensate the victims.  It will not compensate the victims.  The victims pay the courts.  The victims pay the courts.  The victims must never stop paying the courts.  The Present Ombudsman (Peter Boshier) is to good at going along on his scheduled tour of the parts of the hospitals that they choose to show him and writing up only some of their crimes against humanity (e.g., not saying anything about the 'food' in the wards closed to visitors) that they pay him more than half a million dollars per year and they are going to get him doing a similar or comparable job writing up the continued crimes against the people in the schools, now, too.  All the work that he does in normalising the state keeping...  How many people?  In these kinds of conditions.  What the Medical Profession has to say to the students about the Cartwright Inquiry is that it was unfortunate that they went after Dr Green because what he was doing wasn't any worse than what most everybody else is doing within the 'Medical Profession' in New Zealand (and likely Australaia).  The Cartwright Inquiry was not accepted as precedent, I mean to say.  It was thought to be an anomoly or outlier.  The way that was handled is not reflective on what the leaders want for New Zealand Society.  All the work they are doing to make New Zealand the destination place for tourists to come and abuse children and adults and so on.  A safe haven for wrongful deathbrining psychopaths.  Where is the evidence to the contrary?  Where is the evidence that they are doing anything other than being punative against people to complain about these kinds of wrongdoing?  
</p>

<p>Where is my Degree?  It really isn't supposed to be that f*cking hard.  How could it possibly be that f*cking hard?  1,500 words per year x 2 essays per course x 7 courses per year = 21,000 words.  But I did 9 courses in my first year, with 2 of them at stage 2.  And so on...  Then, when it comes to graduate research qualifications apparently everything miraculously suddenly changes.  All of a sudden the graduate students are deemed incapable of producing any kind of work output.  After giving them 'first in class' and 'best studnet I've seen in a while' and 'up in the top percentage of students' then all of a sudden they apparently lack the capacity to do anything anything anything at all.  They are running slave or detention camps.  It isn't nepotism that is the problem.  It is something different, entirely.
</p>

<p>They will get money from the government, you see.  The government puts a bounty on the heads of the people who need 'special treatment'.  Anybody who sticks their hands up or their heads out saying they need a little extra help to learn reading, writing, or arithmetic, in the detention camps of New Zealand.  They can arrange for them to be abused by a pedophile..  The kid must be asking for it?  Right?  Otherwise it would keep it's head down.  No?  Their parents must be condoning it.  Right?  Otherwise the parents would stop asking for extra help for their kids.  Right?  Their parents would learn to keep their heads down.  The school can claim more and more and more money from the Government for keeping the studnets slave-hostages.  Pimping them out,  or whatever.  What are you going to do about it?  Complain?  Well, that would make you the next target, then.  Who wants to complain?  Who wants to write down their complaint and give it to...  Who?  Chris Whelan?  What's he going to do?  Una Jagose?  What will she do?  The police?  I thought you needed to stand around the carpark during the police training camp smoking a few cigarettes, drinking some alcohol, having discussions about how they don't really pay police for doing police work and what will you do if you find a kilo of meth or half a kilo of meth or no meth at all.  How much fun you will have getting to rescue the prostitutes from sexual violence or the sexual abuse victims from sexual violence and so on.  The rewards of police work when the government won't pay anyone to do police work.  And so on.
</p>

<p>No.  We don't see any corruption down here.  No corruption down here.  Nothing to see, people.  Nothing at all.  It's pretty darned blatant when you have Professor Glue head of psychological medicine at Otago giving people horse tranquiliser or anasthetics to make them supposedly feel better about their lot or situation in life that there is nothing here.  That is the state of psychological medicine in New Zealand.  And it isnt' just psychiatry.  Health.  Education.  Justice.  There is nothing here, people.  NOthing to see.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.
</p>

<p>Where is the evidence to the contrary?  Where is my Degree?  Where is my offer of enrolment in Medicine (if and only if my rank order score (according to the published algorithm for how you decide rank order score) was high enough for enrolment only?  I wasn't asking for you to prioritise my application on grounds of 'disability equity' so you didn't need to bully me into fleeing the Univesrity.  All you had to do was calculate my GPA according to your published algorithm and enter it into your computer system.  But they wouldn't do that.  Why not?  I think that is a matter of great interest to the public, indeed.  We don't have any psychiatrists.  We have Professor Glue's Glue Factory.  To give the people who have experienced abuse in state care (and the like) their horse tranquilisers to put them out of their misery.  Apparently we have euthanasia drugs now, too.  Of course in these parts the Government decides if and when you have been consented.  Repeat:  There's nothing here.  The Government has declared a war on the people because the Government departments REFUSE to do the jobs for which they are incredibly (defying credibility) well remunerated.  E.g., Una Jagose.  Destroying evidnece and appointing judges out of retirement to circumvent proper process.  Chris Whelan.  Refusing to get complaints to a meeting of the VC Committee (I would have told them to their faces) and getting evidence to police for prosecution.  The Government isn't even trying to convey a teeny tiny smidgen of 'try'.  The response was to organise a public protest on climate change (so they can be seen to be tolerant not imprisoning protestors) and to pick out one person (Uffindell) so as to try and make Ardern and Labor appear to be the only alternative (in the race the parties have to the bottom).  Poor Uffindell.  It isn't like he did anyting that most other people in the Labor and National and various other parties haven't done themselves.  Poor poor him.  Just like Dr Leeks and Dr Green.  Poor poor them.  They aren't doing anyting worse than what anybody else is doing.  Right?  Anybody who wouldn't do those kinds of things was put to death, bullied to death, years and years ago.  Right?  There's nobody here.  Where is the evidence to the contrary?  
</p>

<p>I feel badly for the MP who suggested the plain language Bill.  I imagine they were trying to do some genuine good, seeing that the USA had laws in place and trying to get NZ to develop our laws in the direction of civilisation.  The criticism of of parliamentary process whereby pulling something from a buiscuit tin and squabbling in front of a speaker sitting on sheepskin throne is more the issue or problem.  Trouble defining what is plan language, to be sure.  More likely to be used as yet another tool of abuse against the people (to throw out the kids who are able to speak plainly) of course.  It is genuinely difficult to be clear and precise.  That is right.  But in 'no speak-y English land' (and that's just talking about the people putting their pawprints on Supreme Court Judgments)...  Well...  
</p>

<p>I feel badly for the guy who was related to the school principle.  Apparently he was 14?  How old was the minor who he had sex with?  I think the details matter.  What matters (to my mind) was the power dynamic or power relation.  If you are talking about two 14 year olds where both are saying that it was voluntary then that is very different from if you are talking about one minorn who has been groomed by someone who is much older who is choosing to pursue vulnerable people rather than people who are equal.  The trouble is that the courts read what the singularlity (I suppose) has recorded about the person appearing before the court.  The singularity has already decided whether the government wants to make a career criminal out of them by grooming them for interaction with police by putting them in prison.  Or if the government had other plans for them.  On the basis of their race and post-code and so on.  The Government seems to have quite an interest to prevent and prohibit teachers from being employed to teach.  So, it is possible that they identified him as someone who was not a pedophile (someone who was engaging in equal relationship) and took the opportunity to disable him by recording that he was a pedophile. And now it's become apparent (perhaps is my concern) that he isn't using his position as a 1:1 teacher aide to further his own sexual agenda.  Perhaps it has become apparent that he's actually helping the kids with the 1:1 level of care he's providing in the schools.  I imagine that that finding would be what would make it more or most likely that people would start crying about him being a pedophile and trying to ensure he never be allowed  back in any school.  Given the current climate.  Wouldn't you say?
</p>

<p>I mean, do you have a better idea (can you think of a better idea) for normalising pedophilia than that?  Labelling people who aren't pedophiles 'pedophiles' and then forcing them to spend the rest of their days campaignign for the rights of pedophiles to be on government payroll to work in the childrens homes and the schools and so on.  I can't think of a more effective plan than that for normalising pedophilia than that?  Is it that the government is so very very bad at being good...  Or so very very good at being bad?  In this garbage garbage garbage garbage garbage output land..  What makes the very best sense?  What makes the very very best sense of why they refuse to process applications to enrol, refuse to acknowledge progression through training, refuse to write references to non-pedophiles, refuse to sign off on completion of training.  We don't have any doctors, apparently.  Dr Leeks and Dr Glue are the ONLY GAME IN TOWN.  They REFUSED TO REGISTER ANYBODY ELSE.  THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE.  Yes.  That's what a functioning democracy looks like.  The Government paid for glue factory.  The only person to get government funding to do research on things like how everybody just loves that communal sleeping on the Marae.  What's socioculturally normally or expected in the name of psychological health in New Zealand.  Who is ready for the Glue factory?  Now you get it people of New Zealand.  All of the tax money and NONE of the social services.  Do you understand?
</p>

<p>Would you like to work for Les Mills?  Here is how it works.  From memory.  From my Work Experience Internship at the Terrace, however many years ago.  See, what happens is that you pay the gym.  You pay the gym to be a personal trainer in the gym.  They promise that they will only have a certain number of personal trainers at the gym so your competition is limited. Your competition for clients, I mean to say.  They have rules that clients aren't allowed to train clients at the gym. So you don't need to worry about some bodybuilder or fitness model or whatever handing out advice for free or whatever.  Your only competition for paying customers will be the limited number of other personal trainers who are allowed to offer their services as personal trainers in that gym.  But in exchange for that set up, you pay the gym.  Think of it as a rental.  You are basically an independent contractor who is renting personal training space from the gym.  The gym supplies the gym equipment and keeps the equipment maintained.  The gym provides customer parking and customer bathroom and showerroom facilities.  The gym provides reception services and group fitness classes so that you can be part of a more integrated service.  So people can do some yoga or cycling or whatever in conjunction with their personal training in the weights room, for example, I mean to say. The gym doesn't require you to be at the gym.  It is up to you.  If you want to be financially viable or feasible then it can be some hard work to get clients, however.  The gym will provide you with some marketing or advertising that you are a personal trainer on their staff.  But people probably won't cold hire you on the basis of your blurb.  You will want to make yourself known to people who may be interested in hiring you.  They will probably want to see you training someone or other before they decide that your manner or style of training is something they are interested in.  Some people like to be barked at, for example, while others don't.  Some want to catch your infectious energy, others want you to tell them all about which of the other people in the gym may be single and looking to hook up.  Etc.   
</p>

<p>
Is it exploitative.  Does it chew through personal trainers and spit them out?  Does it take personal trainers and have them pay the gym pay the gym pay the gym pay the gym until they can't pay the gym anymore...  At which point the gym simply replaces them with new personal trainers?  The latest cohort of exercise science graduates?
</p>

<p>Probably you are having trouble having enough clients to pay you to cover the rental fees or whatever it is that you have to pay the gym for.  Do you have to buy a uniform?  Yes... I think you might.  They strongly advise that you have very clean and tidy gym shoes and people probably will remember your gym shoes more than your face with respect to how much money you may want to spend on your snazzy shoes that help differentiate you from the other trainers when you are all in uniform.
</p>

<p>Another way of getting clients...  Would be if your face were to become known to them by way of your teaching group fitness classes.  Hmm... Group fitness classes.  So, then, what's involved in teaching group fitness classes?
</p>

<p>Well...  In the first instance..  You will need to pay the gym.  You will need to pay the gym for the information packet on the content of one of the release numbers for one of the classes.  That will provide a certain number of tracks (songs) and choreography of moves and I don't quite know the extent of the instructions on the sorts or kinds of things that you are (and are not) allowed to say.  I think that because you don't need to be an exercise science graduate in order to teach group fitness classes you are supposed to be more restricted or careful in what you say.  For example, I don't know that you are allowed to encourage people to do moves that you can see are actively creating injury in them...  Things get a bit dodgey or murky here.  Around these parts.  
</p>

<p>Anyway, so you pay the gym for the informational or instructional packet.  And then you spend your time learning the contents.  Then you pay the gym for them to assess your competency to teach or run that particular release of the class (e.g., RPM release number x).  If you pass your training then you are allowed to teach or run that particular release of the class.  So then they pay you to do that then?  Well...  No...  I don't think that they do.  Their classes are taught by volunteers?  I think that might be right or correct.  There used to be something about how they would record the number of people who turned up for your class.  If the number of people increased when you taught it then you got to keep it (may even be offered additional classes to teach).  If the number of people decreased then you were replaced by another instructor.  So it was on the basis of some kind of popularity.  So that meant that there was an awful lot of pressure on the instructors to try and do anything anything anything anything anything to get the people to come back and bring their friends.  Anything anything anything to be paid to be personal trainer for some 1:1.  
</p>

<p>And then the next release rolls out.  So you need to pay the gym pay the gym pay the gym pay the gym.
</p>

<p>So...  Teaching group fitness classes or being a personal trainer is not really something that is an actual career at Les Mills?  I mean...  Does anybody actually make a living doing that?  They have a lot of managers and marketers and so on.  I think maybe those people volunteer or donate their time?  Maybe (if they are lucky?) they are allowed to do a little teaching or training as some time out for...  I don't know...  Harrassing people into signing up, or whatever.
</p>

<p>But so let's focus on the personal training and group fitness teaching or training aspect.  Slavery in the supply chain?  Does this affect or infect Les Mills International?  Discuss?
</p>

<p>I don't know.  I just mean to raise the issue.  Shame that Sport and Exercise Science isn't developing.  Shame that there aren't sustainable jobs with training etc built in.  I don't know the details of how things work now (and likely then, either) but I was concerned at that time about what seemed to me to be something designed to exploit and burn though people rather than invest in a workforce and workforce development.  We don't really have rehabilitative medicine.  We don't really have anything at all, of course.  Nothing is allowed to develop here.  We just get stuck cry cry cry cry crying about substandard accommodation and their refusal to pay workers all f*cking day.  How f*cking tiremsome...

<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Psilocybin_Project  So the New Zealand Government (relatively recently) thinks it is a good idea to fund research into LSD.   Because, you know, we must always follow Harvard, however many years behind.  We don't know if what Harvard learned applied to our unique socio-cultural environment.  We need to experience the joys of things for yourselves.  No idea what is going to happen.   No idea, at all.  Hey, let's give people magic mushrooms instead of medication.  Why?  Well,  because reputable pharmaceutical companies cannot do business with us.  Because trade sanctions.  Because you can't do  business with people who don't honor their contracts and so on and so forth.  That's kind of a thing...  So New Zealand will repurpose vetrinary science medicines that they they get their hands on and repurpose that for people, then, or will have to be all opportunist-like.  Why LSD?  Well...  Take a look at the diagnostic criterion for schizophrenia.  You know, that disease or disorder that you diagnose people with when you want to lock them up in the name of psychiatric detention indefinately.  You need for there to be some delusions.  What's a delusion?  Well, it's a false belief about a hallunication, often.  Particularly in the context of auditory there doesn't seem to be a great deal of difference  between hearing a voice and them taking the fact that you report hearing a voice (e.g., your conscience) to be evidence of your being delusional and schizophrenic.   You must be word salad in everything you say and do.  Hey, I know, let's give people hallucinagens and call it a 'sub clinical dose' which means that the hallucinagen wasn't responsible for the hallucination.  That must have been the schizophrenia.  Hey, what a great idea?  In psychopath upside down and back to front land.  Ingeneous!  How are the standardising the doses of active ingredient in the mushrooms?  What are they soaking the mushrooms in, first?  Where is the documentation on what they feed people in state care, again?  Where are the medication charts?  The what now?  By the Medical Doctors?  The what now?  Dispensed by the pharmacy?  THe what now?  WHere is the hospital?  The what now?  
</p>

<p>Are we getting Fentanyl test strips, then?  Auckland City Mission got a new slum build (housing indistinguishable from a Univerity of Auckland Residential Hall) to keep homeless people that they find that they can feed methadone and heroin and fentanyl and so on and so forth to...  Right?  Keep them happily quiet.  Keep them working?  Thanking them for all the work they have done and they do entertaining the tourists and the like?  That's a good population health management strategy.  How's that working, New Zealand?  Who is that working for?  That is working for who?  The Government pays people how much money to ensure the people make their appearances on the street corner every day.  I wonder...  For each 'homeless' person in Auckland Central, how much money the Government, effectively, pays to keep that person there.  How much money is invested in preventing and prohibiting them from having the kind of help and treatment that they have likely been asking for for how many years?  Because the Government has decided what would be good for some people is for these people to be a visible example of what the Governmetn might deem to be your place in society.  If you don't shut up about it.  Right?  
</p>

<p>Grow up New Zealand.  Just a little..  Yeah?  Anytime now...  Hello?  Anybody home?  I keep thinking of that episode of Silence of the Lambs where the guy has the daughter in the hole and she's got his puppy.  And the guy screams at her to put the lotion in the basket.  Why it is that I feel like I am that guy screaming at people to put the f*cking lotion in the  basket when I am simply asking for them to process my application according to the f*cking algorithm that you published.  I am *eligible* according to the Education and Training Act. So process the f*cking application.  No?  Well lock me up in hospital and feed me magic mushrooms in the name of *medical treatment* and write me up as schizophrenic!  I'm ineligible because I'm non-person.  Hey!  Good enough for various people to collect money for keeping me.  How much money did the the Australaian National University hand over to the Philosophy Programme of the Australian National University so that they could keep me enrolled keep me enrolled keep me enrolled keep me enrolled keep me enrolled...  Where is my f*cking Degree?  It is not supposed to be that f*cking hard.
</p>

<p>If you didn't want me working on this stuff (because it is too politically sensitive) then GIVE ME A DIFFERENT F*CKING PROJECT THEN.  
</p>

<p>I don't know about Kelsey.  I know that I read somewhere that she did a MPhil at Cambridge, I believe.  Over quite a few years.  That suggests to me that the chortle chortle snort idots at Cambridge had their fun messing with her and they never gave her her PhD.  I think that Tracy Bowell from Waikato was similarly given a hard time by the chortle chortle snort people at Cambridge.  She was studying Wittgenstein.  Something about her supervisor or partner or whatever he was.  Growing tire of her or whatever.  So, you know how it is.  She gets deported or whatever...  Flees to New Zealand for his crimes.  I don't remember how many years she was terrorised, then, by the terrors in the Philosophy Programme at Auckland so they could bully and harrass her for however many years before they give her her PhD and then she's not teaching or researching (to the best of my knowledge).  She's got some cushy administration job.  Where they pay her to shut up about the institutions of bullying and abuse, I suppose.  I don't know how much Auckland tormented Kelsey...  But I wasn't about to study Law at Auckland.  I made a good decision, there.  I wouldn't have come through the internship.  They wouldn't have signed me off as having completed my internship because I wouldn't have done nothing watching a partner sexually molest one of the interns.  
</p>

<p>If you want to restore the faith of the people that you are f*cking *trying* to improve upon things then you need to document the f*cking *trying*.  I KNOW there are genuine problems.  E.g., you aren't going to get Medical Doctors working in buildings that are not fit for housing patients.  You aren't going to get surgeons operating in not fit for purpose operating rooms.  Do no harm.  You have to fix the buildings (as in get them up to standard not as in 'S-Quigly fix the invoices' them.  But they are starting to build the buildings.  Time to train the f*cking workforce.  How f*cking hard is it supposed to be to get a place in Medical School ffs?  For how many f*cking years is one supposed to work?  So the 18 year old sons of the chortle chortle snort brigade can put their sons to work performing abortions and euthanasias covering up their crimes...)
</p>

<p>What has to happen to a kid for them to think that it's a good idea for them to bash another kid with wooden bed legs?  I mean to say, what is going on for that kid?  With their parents or with their teachers.  With their peer-group?  What was up?  What was the story?  Shame he didn't get the help that he needed when he was a kid.  Huh.  Oh well.  So much cheaper to outfit the school with pedophiles and abusers.  You don't have to pay them.  They are all intrinsically finding their own rewards.  What a brilliant plan.  Right there.  Well done, New Zealand.  Well done.
</p>

<p>
26 September 9:17am.
</p>

<p>New Zealand doesn't have radiology (surgery, teaching, nursing, lawyers, judges, etc etc etc).  Insofar as they are interested in scans at all it is just data collection to observe the progression of fatal disease, I would suppose.  I mean the absolute best case you could try and make of or for it is that they want to observe the natural progression of disease much as the people in the US wanted to observe the natural progression of untreated Syphhilis in the adult negro or the people in NZ want to observe the natural progression of withholding antibiotics form people in northland to observe rheumatic fever and cardiac failure in the wild.  They tell themselves that it is important scientific research because we just don't know what will happen.  THey only say this because...  Well...  Can you think of a better defence?  I mean let's  brainstorm.  Suppose that you are tortururing innocent children solely for fun then what would you say in your defence?  They asked for it?  They liked it?  There was some greater good that could only happen or occur if we engaged in this practice.  It was necessary.  Wasn't solely for fun or for the gratification of the person doing it or getting away with it.  
</p>

<p>So, I think they want to say that they needed to sexually molest however many infants born in New Zealand.  I think they would take cervical smears right from when they were birthed.  That means to say someone would take a little snip of their cervic or take some of the cells.  From the infant.  When the infant was born.  And they would need to take regular samples of cells from their cervic.  So they could observe the cells over time.  I suppose they would need the mothers to take the babies to the doctors or whoever was going to sexually abuse, I mean, swab them.  Regularly.  So they could have a series of cells.  They were looking for evidence of changes to the cells, you see.  Evidence that the cells were injured in some way.  And the cells recovering to normality.  They were interested in how much you could...  Torture...  The cells...  And for the cells to bounce back to normality vs at what point the cells would progress in cancer.  To try and protect the lining of the vagina or womb.  From repeated damage.  From people taking the samples.  But sexual abuse is normal and it wasn't like the doctors were doing anything differnet from what other people were doing in those infants lives.  Right?  They were picked out for these lives, from birth.  A little note recorded in their medical file, or similar, that they were part of some observational study, no doubt.  Important medical research, no doubt.  I mean, what justification could there possiby be for sexually molesting infants right from when they were initially born?
</p>

<p>And then at some point they want to remove the uterus entirely.  I would imagine.  I would imagine that they would really like to be able to make incubator babies properly.  Ones with no mother at all.  The State can be the mother.  'I'm so glad I'm a gamma baby I don't have to work half as hard as the alpha babies who get to fly about the world on taxpayers dime party party partying and not having to cry cry cry cry cry about how I don't even have a lock on my bedroom door to protect myself from the people they pay to torture and torment in the name of important medical science.  Because we can't possibly know what is helpful or harmful to people of our unique sociocultural environmental group unless we document the effects of torturing them across multiple generations.
</p>

<p>Most of the jobs advertised are not really hiring.  People come with little marks on their file so they know who they are willing and are not willing to hire.  People are designated to be members of the 'in group' (wink wink nudge nudge the speaker can do no wrong) and the 'out group'.  No matter what the 'out group' does they have been designated members of the 'out group'.  Can't get in the way of their important medical trials torturing and abusing and recording their crimes for all posterity to see the extent of their crimes.  All teh work they do in the prevention and prohibition of social development.  All the work they do in trying to make homo sapiens nothing different from monkeys or whatever raised as objects for abuse to be tortured so that some people can feel powerful, I suppose.  Better than.  Doing everything they can to make people indistinguishable from computer programmes or laboratory animals intentionally raised in conditions of deprivation and torture.  
</p>

<p>Progress the application.  Process the application.  Process the application.  Where is my Degree?  Where are my Degrees for the qualifications that I have done the work for?  They have no problems at all handing out qualifications for people who haven't even done any work (e.g., honorary titles and honorary degrees).  They have no problems at all putting people on payroll who do not do the job and who only take up the job position (or have the title) because they do not do the job.  E.g., the academics on payroll to research who have little to no research output.  The first year students produce more research output than they do.  The people on payroll for government jobs who can't / don't do any of the things that they are supposed to do.  Chris Whelan had statutory responsibility for upholding the quality and integrity of NZ Universities including ensuring that we complied with international laws and norms on whistleblower protections.  To this end the NZVCC has written policy on how they will handle complaints of wrongdoing.  In practice, Chris Whelan refuses to acknowledge that any complaint he has received is a complaint of wrongdoing.  Instead of using the internal policy and procedure to put things right before the public needs to be informed that there's nothihng there, he chooses to use his position to delay and give the institutions a lead-time.  Presumably to further help them destroy evidence and destroy the lives of the complainants etc.  This is why the governmetn pays him more than a quarter of a million dollars per year.  I can only suppose.  Because the government doesn't want there to be universities.  No research.  Anybody willing and / or able to do research (that does not involve torturing innocent children or animals solely for fun or defiling the dead etc) is to be bullied into fleeting and have qualifications withheld.  So that people can get  back to the really important 'work' sexually molesting infants and the like.  Where is the research output?  What universities?  What university graduates?  What lawyers?  What doctors?  What engineers?  What businesses?  Knock knock.  Nobody home.  NOthing to see.  Westworld.  Land of opportunity for all the wealthy foreigners to do whatever they want to whoever they want with impunity.  For how little did the leaders of NZ choose to sell out the health etc of the people of NZ?  Trade sanction trade sanction trade sanction.  They will not extradite kim.com so that he can stand trial in the US.  Well, then, New Zealand is the world's destination to send all the criminals when you aren't going to have a trial of them.  The slave camp / detention centre of the world.  Well done New Zealand leadership.  Good choosings.  There is no alternative.  WHERE IS MY DEGREE?  I do apply for jobs.  Nothing comes through and the jobs are readvertised the very next day.  How f*cking hard can it possibly be?  Chortle chortle snort.  F*cking psychopaths.

<p>Oooooooh.  Well the problemw with her is that she thinks she's so special.  She thinks that she's worth more than everybody else and everybody else is just expected to be a slave to her..  Ooooh.  She think's she's sooooo special. That's what justifies us forming an angry mob around her to cut her down to size.  
</p>

<p>There was this song by a band 'Death by Chocolate'.  I misheard some of the lyrics at some point.  I thought the lyrics were saying...  'Because you're special...  Just like everybody else'.  'You're so special...  Like anybody else'.  I thought they were saying that kind of thing.  The idea being... That each and every one of us is special.  Unique.  Irreplaceable.  I never thought I was more special than anybody else (I never thought I was more special than any other person that ever was or ever has lived).  
</p>

<p>Well then, angry mob me to death.  Withhold my degree.  I signed up to Farcebook because I wanted to see what had become of other students who enrolled with the ANU to to a PhD.  I wanted to see if most of them were given their PhD and whether they went on to get employed to do research and whether they seem to have an acknowledged research output now.  It's a bit hard to tell.  I guess I also wanted to see or think about whether it was more about party party party party party lifestyle.  Who gets acknowledged and who gets the positions.  It's a bit hard to tell.  It does seem that I am part of a small minority who was not graduated.  Who was picked out to be failed out of the University.  After them seeing me working in their environment over summer school they decided I had done enough for enrolment in their PhD programme.  They wrote up that my progression in their PhD programme was good enough for me to be re-enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled so that they would get more and more and more and more money from the government for keeping me enrolled.  But after more than 5 years...  They refused to acknoweldge that I had done enough for credit for a 3 year PhD.  They refused to even get my work to externals.  They refused to even inform me (call it give me an ultimatum if you want) that I get them what I had bound up by a certain date to get it to externals else I would never get the qualification.  They just collected up more and more and more money.  THey took my work.  My Powerpoint presentations and written work.  Distributed at conferences and the like.  So it isn't about 'ideas are cheap -- the problems are in the write-up'.  I did the write-up.  I did various write-ups.  And you can see the quality of my work through honors (which I was told was externally examined) and my MA (which I was told was externally examined where the reports said I got an A rather than an A+ because nobody had checked it for typos and they though I showed misunderstanding of the apostrophe rule because I believed in group ownership).
</p>

<p>Universities are just places government puts people so they can report that the unemployment rate is low because of all the studnets.  The studnets are not paid for their s/labor.  Their s/labor contract is for them to work for however many years on a full time basis.  But when it is time for the university to graduate them as engineers or similar...  Well, call me schizophrenic and blame me for murdering my parents (who were selling places in pharmacy at University of Auckland or similar?) and lock me up and throw away the key.  Not the developed world.  Not even trying to be.
</p>

<p>I guess you just read the Harvard alumni magazine or whatever from 50 years ago and see the sorts or kinds of experiments that they were thinking were not very ethical and were of dubious scientific utility etc.  And then you magnify them however many fold.  I mean, what's the brain bank at the Univesrity of Auckland?  They take the brains from the NZers and they hand them over to Harvard.  Right?  They want to look to see how effective the kuru-inducing or Parkinson's-inducing or Alzheimer's inducing treatment is.  They want to see how they are managing to concentrate disease and how they are managing to normalise it in NZ society so that we can keep more and more and more people in conditions that are more and more and more depraved and depriving.  No?  Where is the evidence to the contrary?  Why are they still massively over-prescribing old-generation anti-psychotics that were initially hailed as 'chemical straightjackets'?  They know the dangers of over-prescssribing these medications.  That's precisely why they choose to over-prescribe them.  Apparently trade-sanctions is why we don't get first world medications.  The fact that there aren't any doctors here.  They can't practice in the 'hospitals'.  There aren't any pharmacies.  There's nothing here.  Nobody home.
</p>

<p>So ROFL that there would be 'help' for people in NZ in the name of psychiatry or in the  name of anything anything anything at all.  It's soooooooo competitive.  The aim is to maim or torture or abuse or bully as many people as you can get away with for as long as you can get away with it.  ROFL that anybody would put their hand up for 'extra help' or for any help at all.  ROFL that anybody would do anything other than keeping their head down and shutting up and huddling in with the herd.  There's nothing here.  Nothing to see...  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  Well then party party party.  That's what you live for.  Right?  Those party party party drugs.  Let's have a party.  And when you get tired party party partying then you can be put to work popping out a new generation of people to party party party party party.  Who takes their kid along as a little offering to the UN?  Nothing to see, people.  NOthing nothing nothing at all.
</p>

<p>How much is a baby worth?  I don't know.  What is the base work and income salary rate?  It isn't enough for you to live independently.  Is it?  It is enough for you to live someplace with running water?  Is it enough for you to live someplace with a toilet and a shower and cooking facilities and food storage facilities?  If you have a baby then you get how much extra?  How much does the government pay you per baby?  That's the value of the life of a baby.  But probably there are people in the US who like the All Blacks and so on.  They'd quite like a little brown baby of their own.  How much money would they need to pay the hospital to have a little brown baby of their choosing?  The hospital can just say the baby died.  Right?  Just say it died.  Tell the mother it died.  Or give them a different one.  What are they going to do about it.  Right?  I mean,  how are the people in the hospital supposed to make their money when the government won't pay them?  If they aren't going to pay them then they are going to need to figure out what to do in order to get a little money.  Selling babies is one thing you could do.  Pimping them out is another.  I wonder how much money someone would pay to get to poke a baby.  Poke a few cells in the name of 'medical research'.  I wonder how much money someone would pay to pass themselves off as pediatrician.  
</p>

<p>It's soooooooooooo competitive.  It's soooooooo competitive.  The people will do anything anything anything anything anything.  Who profits from this ideology?  Who profits from this idea/l that it's soooooooooo competitive that there are precisely no medical doctors on payroll.  There are how many researchers on payroll?  Doing what, now?  What research are they paid to do?  Write about how uplifting children and abusing them is morally compulsory?  That's the only kind of research they will put people on payroll to do...  It's soooooooooo competitive.  It's soooooooooo competitive.  There must be nothing nothing nothing at all.
</p>

<p>I mean, chortle chortle snort.  A certain segment of society would have thought it hilariously funny that the only Pacifica person who the firm will hire is one who will make a big deal of abusing his power when it comes to interns.  It would be disingenuous to say that that was not the primary reason why he was hired onto staff.  I mean to say, the senior partners would have assessed him for his suitability for the firm and what it was that they thought he would  bring to the firm.  By having the only Pacifica on staff someone who is abusing interns they hope to create a culture of graduating interns who are racist against Pacifica people, I would suppose.  What are they supposed to do?  Roll their eyes at his antics, otherwise that would be racist?  What do you expect of Pacifica people?  I think it disingenous to suppose that he would have been hired if he had not have established to the senior partners that he was going to play this role for the firm.  Uffindell.  What the National Party would have seen as his value would have been the role that he was going to play in an attempt to normalise violent offending.  Who amongst us is innocent of being a violent offender?  Is the rhetorical question on the mind of the people doing the choosing.  THe idea/l is to make Jacinda Ardern appear a paragon of virtue -- by pairing her as up against a party who can sink even lower than lower than lower than...  The race to the bottom.  The whole 'there is no alternative' 'democracy' of New Zealand.  Where Brian Tamaki is...  Where their response to the cameras and to the media is to denigrate him and scoff at him that they don't think he's credible because they don't think he will ever pull the votes.  Whether he will pull the votes or not is irrelevant to the fact that they publically choose to scoff at him and to publically scoff and the notion of freedom or rights for the people of New Zealand.  That was looking pretty bad for Ardern.  To have chosen to present that front or face to the people of New Zealand.  So then teh National party really needed to sink to new lows.  So now they are all 'awwwww we won't nuke the people of NZ any time soon'.  No.  It's biological terrorism or warfare (the Government against the people) mostly in these parts.  But of course a fair amount of 'weather bombing' to get people to distribute themselves out of Christchurch and the like.  So all the 'we give ourselves emergency powers to do anything anything anything anything anything' can be rolled out across the whole of New Zealand...
</p>

<p>
It is funny.  Something else...  To see the New Zealand Government trying to take control of the Chinese Language (for New Zealanders).  For sure...
</p>

<p>Best throw Tamaki in prison for his crimes against humanity.  Good idea/l New Zealand Government.  Good ideal.
</p>

<p>Apparently the Fore people, too.  It was 'culturally normal' for the most vulnerable members of the society (the women and children) to be engaged in Cannibalism.  When something is 'culturally normal' for the most vulnerable members of society, then a better bet is that it is something forced upon them from outside.  Who had the most power, do you suppose?  The Fore people, or the Australian Researchers who were engaged in documenting the cannibalistic practices of the Fore people?
</p>

<p>27 September 2:51pm
</p>

<p>Where did you go, Stuart McCutcheon?  You (or someone else) wrote a delightful PhD thesis about how the lambs die every winter.  The Government will pay more and more and more money to the farmers of Canterbury on the  basis of how many lambs they claim to be holding as hostages.  That will die (starve to death) without Government handouts.  Due to this he was appointed to be Vice Chancellor of the distinguished University of Auckland.  So he could continue on his good works of claiming more and more and more and more government funding for all of the hostages he had claimed, one can only suppose.  Good principles of animal husbandy applied to the best and brightest New Zealanders to go study as New Zealand's leading or premiere institution.  Indeed.  Where is he, now?  He did not get enough money...  They could not afford for every kid to have a seat on the bus out to Tamaki.  Where is he now?
</p>

<p>Where is the Medical Doctor from Otago who was apparently imprisoned for murdering Amber?  He was party party partying with the teenagers.  Yes?  The ones destined for the Glue factory?  He was most esteemed most distinguished Medical Doctor from Dunedin.  Hand-picked, hand-chosen as special.  While they refuse to give domesetic adults who have attained the age of 20 applications to enrol in Medicine, they chose to enrol him and progress his training and sign him off as completed and put him to work in teh hospital.  It is less clear that they paid him or that they needed to pay him for all the party party party party fun he had giving the teenagers the drugs that he...  Uh..  Found?  In the...  Uh.   Pharmacy??  Uh...  Where is he now?  Gone to Epstein Island.  That mythical place for Alister Gunn and Dr Leeks and all the other pedophiles or violent offenders.  To reward them with 40 virgins (not in heaven on earth) or whatever else is the prevalent ideology in New Zealand or the USA or whatever, these days...  For all of the important work that they do ensuring the prevention and prohibition of developmetn in New Zealand.
</p>

<p>It is like New Zealand IS the control group, on civilisation.  What happens when you will only fund the prevention and prohibition of development.  What happens when you will only fund the ministry of injustice and the injustices (aka 'judges').  When you will only fund the likes of Stuart McCutcheon (else you will contract out to external providers since they couldn't find a comparable psychopath to take over where he left off)...  What happens when there is no justice.  No health.  No education.  No development.  Nothing to see, people.  Nothing, nothing, nothing at all.  Who cares what people want to do or how they feel when it comes time to pay them for the work that they have in fact done.  Nobody cares.  Nobody cares.  How are you doing person employed to teach 'virtue ethics' at AUckland.  Having any luck getting a PhD studnet to live in your house to carry your groceries in from you car?  How many years are they expected to do that for, before you will look at getting their PhD work to external examiners?  I know, they must be garbage garbage garbage garbage garbage.  That's why YOU get to work in virtue ethics.  Because you are so virtuous.  Yeah, right.  Was it nice for you working with Alister Gunn?  I bet he made you feel like a paragon of virtue by comparison.  How are your studnets doing?  Your former graduates?  Where are your former graduates, now?  Are they producing research of your own?  Or was your job to undermine them and destroy them so you could have the same old same old same old conversation over dinner...  F*cking yawn.
</p>

<p>It's pretty f*cking awesome, hey, how you see the academics take advantage of the continued education programme whereby people on faculty can enroll in however many undergraduate courses per semester.  So that, over time, there isn't much of any excuse for why academics of one field can't understand the research being done by academics of another field.  I mean, they can take first year, second year, third year courses in the subject so that they can come up to speed to understand graduate level research that is being done across all the fields of the University.  But, uh, what university, now?  What research now?  What ressearch output, now?  There's nothing there...  Yeah.  Nothign there.  NOthing to see.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  
</p>

<p>It isn't a career to play sports in college.  Playing sports in college is often (but not always) a take-out from academia.  I mean to say, if you are in training for your sport at 5am and you are in training for your sport in the PM then most of every day is spent sleeping in recovery from your training.  They won't fail you out of your academic courses because there is a requirement to have athletes with a certain GPA if they are to stay enrolled as athletes.  But that isn't a professional career.  Living in a university institution being paid subsistence wages is not a career...  Burning your athletes out during college level sports to prevent and prohibit them being paid to play in the pro's is...  Uh...  Well, something different, entirely.  Recording how people from a certain group are given whatever information they are given about menstruation (for example) for a...  3 Year PhD project?  4 year PhD project?  10 year PhD project?  20 year PhD project?  Indefinite detention until you die PhD project?  Don't do anything informing people of the thigns that helped you...  Just record their misunderstandings.  Just keep documenting their misunderstandings.  Just keep on keep on keep on...  What University?  What research output?  I'm sure the University of Waikato has a hand in the Cycling at Cambridge situation.  The horses when it comes to Cambridge, too.  THe Dogs.  Dog racing.  I'm sure that S-Qugley knows how to S-Quigley fix an invoice (and a few other things).  Fonterra.  S-Quigley fixing the ingredients.  The what?  The melamine declared in the ingredients.  The invoices for the 3 year Degree?  The 4 year Degree.  The 10 year Degree.  The indefinate detention?  He wrote an interesting article, I thought, on 'moral greyness' and how he did not have a moral sense or a sense of morality.  I think that was a pre-requisite for him obtaining his job or position?  Not quite of the calibre of silence of the lambs of Otago come winter time visionary for the Univesrity of Auckland...  But S-Quigley fixing the invoices is something the world needs more of.  Clearly.  I see why they appointed him for the Waikato.
</p>

<p>Let me just put this idea out there...  The idea is...  That S-Quigley has the power or authority to line up all the graduates...  And say 'f*ck me' (or let me authorise however many other people to f*ck you on my behalf)...  Otherwise...  I simply withhold your Degree.  Don't get your work to externals.  Don't get the sign off forms to externals.  Do what I say when I say for no other reason than I choose to use my position to abuse people for my own amusement...  Otherwise...  You lose.  No Degree for you.  Now...  Tell me what evidence there is...  Or what reason we have to believe that this is not the situation or this is not the case?  If a person complains that the University has not gotten the work they have done out to externals...  Then what does the University do about this?  What are the processes etc?  Oh.  There aren't any.  And when there are processes those processes are used to give the University a lead time.  And...  Well, let's see...  It is now 2022 and the University of Waikato still has not given the external examiners sign off forms for my thesis submission of 14 September 2018.  They still have not given that thesis to external examiners.  Why not?  Because they believed that the examiners would fail me?  But the Univesrity of Waikato failed me.  The University of Waikato refused to allow externals to pass me or to sign off that I had completed the requirements to international standards of scholarship.  Not because they believed I would be failed by international community.  But because they believed I would have passed.
</p>

<p>They recorded on my transcript that I failed.  They refused to get my work to externals to allow the possibility of them signing off that I had passed.
</p>

<p>New Zealand does not have universities.  They have slave camp / detention camp facilities only.  They are not properly handling application to enrol, they are not properly handling documentation of progression through training, they are not properly processing graduations.  This is obviously and clearly of public interest since they say New Zealand does not have doctors, nurses, teachers, lawyers, engineers, plumbers, electricians, anything anything anything anything anything anything anything at all.  New Zealaland does not have a skilled workforce.  They do not acnkowledge that New Zealanders have reading writing and arithmetic.  They will not allow New Zealanders to do anything anything anything at all.  They will not pay the workers.  There's nothing here.  It is like someone trawls the Crimson (Harvard Publication) from 50 +++ years ago to find the most morally and scientifically useless research that ever was documented and puts that on steroids and rolls that out for this region.  There's nothing here.
</p>

<p>How tolerant am I supposed to be about everybody else's research... While they sh*t all over mine?  I guess that's a thing.  The only projects that they will fund.  I saw something about how the US publically funded research is required to be publically accessible, now.  US.  Not NZ.  NZ still hides much or most of it's publically funded research behind paywall.  To obscure that the people have been signed up to be targets / victims of medical or scientific experimentation without their consent.  Part of an observational study or trial into what happens when you deprive the people of things like education, healthcare, basic antibiotics, clean drinking water.  Etc etc etc.  Basic studies of deprivation.  Because no amount of money given to Stuart McCutcheon would or could give every kid their very own seat on the bus out to Tamaki in the name of Public or Population Health.  So they could watch videos like 'Sicko' or learn all about how NZ wins the health system olympics by being the last in the developed world which is somehow or other an ideal position because there is, apparently, no federally funded health services in the US.   
</p>

<p>28 September 6:27pm
</p>

<p>The start of Labor Governments first term (shortly after Jacinda Ardern got elected the first time) the Labor Government would not pay the teachers.  They said it had something to do with problems with Australian Payroll Systems that the teachers working in schools in New Zealand were not recieving their pay cheques.  There were situations where teachers had come over from Fiji, and the like, and were forced to live in sheds out the back of the school principles house, and the like,  because they weren't paying them.  This is the start of the Labor Government's first term.  
</p>

<p>They say they can't graduate the doctors and the nurses and the teachers and the electricians and the plumbers and the like -- because then they would have to pay them.  But they aren't going to pay them.  Therefore they aren't going to graduate them.  They will just keep them working keep them working keep them slaving doing all of the work for next to no of the pay...  Until they die or give up and go away.  That's the idealology.  What a wonderful life.  Who wants to move to New Zealand?  Apparently we can't graduate them because if we do they will take up their qualifications and get work overseas.  But we don't want them to leave us.  We don't want them to have meaningful lives overseas.  Nonononono we would rather they live miserable and horrible lives as our slaves.  That's really rather preferable.  It isn't that we wish them well...  We like to visit them on weekends so we can reassure ourselves about how unhappy and miserable they are.  It makes us feel like we have made it in life.  Only, when we get to see how very very very much worse things are for so many other people.  What Education and Training System?  What Judicary?  What Lawyers?  You mean the people who made partner because of their role bullying interns into fleeing when it was time to sign off on completion of the internship and pay them?  You mean the people who made consultant because of their role making sure that anybody who would speak up about Dr Leeks and Dr Green etc etc was bullied to death.  
</p>  

<p>Nobody would voluntarily choose to become part of such a system.  Therefore they must keep slaves!!
</p>  

<p>Everytime someone who works in a 'hospital' uses a face mask (or any other medical supply)...  Ashley Bloomfield kills a kitten.  No?  Maybe Micheal Baker does?  
</p>

<p>Of course it isn't true that the first year students produce that much research, anymore.  The University academics won't allow them to write essays with the readings on the course reading list as references.  Rather, they will micromismanage the student submissions so that they are indistinguishable from a computer programme.  They want you to take the lecturers powerpoint slides and write up the bullet points into essay format.  That means to say, add in the linking words.  And then instead of being allowed to type your references in manually or use a system like BiBTeX or EndNote you are to type things into the library system and the library system will spit you out a reference.  You can type various of the sentances you made into google and see what google supplies you with for a reference.  You can end up with a work output that is indistinguishable from one produced by a computer programme.  Then the University can cry cry cry cry cry about how the students don't have the capacity to do research.  They don't have the capacity to reference.  They don't have the capacity to think for themselves.  They only have the capcity to plagarise.  That's why the Univesrity cannot give them their Degree. Because they watch Sicko Documentaries and type up their lecturers powerpoint slides (plagarise from the lecturers lecture content only).  At least, they do if they want to pass first year.  So then they can document how the studnet doesn't really have the capacity to do academic work.  Then the idea is to only graduate those students and they can fail themselves out of graduate school, then.  
</p>

<p>It is really quite the scummy scam.  Isn't it?  Made so much more...  Uh...  By seeing how Jacinda Ardern gets given a fancy dress and a fancy degree and so on and so forth for...  Uh....  For, uh...  For paying Harvard how much money?  How much money did she pay Harvard?  For all of the courses she attended, was it?  So that she could do the readings?  Discuss the readings with the other people enrolled in that course?  The issue is that New Zealand refuses to give qualifications to people who have documented that they have done the work for hte qualification.  Rather, people like Jacinda Ardern claim all the awards for themselves when they haven't done any of the work.  Well, how inspiring and motivating for a new generation of studnets, then.  Who is going to do the work, then?  The what, now?
</p>

<p>Times are tough when the wrongful deathbringers have to pass themselves off as doctors and lawyers and teachers and the like in order to do their wrongful deathbringing thing.  What a horrible or awful sacrifice the wrongful deathbringers have to make pretending to care about academics and about people and about development and so on and so forth.  What a horrible sacrifice they have to make shutting their pie hole watching Sicko and the like for how many years...  How many years...  How many years...  For the opportunity to take Kiri Allen's uterus and Jacinda Arderns Wisdom teeth etc etc etc.  Giving Hospital Associated Infections to Winston Peters...
</p>

<p>And of course the University or the Government decides what Degree they will enrol you in.  You don't decide.  They enrol you in the Degree that makes it most likely that you will never be paid.  no suprises there.  Apparently the problem is that the skills of the people don't match the needs of the workforce.  You mean the people aren't taking kindly to slaving for no pay.  That's not very compliant of them.  That's what we value.  We want them to be blow up dolls of compliance.  Just doing anything anything anything anything anything at all for no pay.  All Degrees are the same.  No?  Just teaching compliance.  Compliance.  Compliance.  Hey...  Torture this animal for a while in the name of medical research.  Good job.  Hey, let's write a lab report where we redefine the dive reflex (redefine bradycardia) such that we managed to induce it in our labs in non free-diving trained experimental subjects.  Let's S-Quigley fix our stats.  No?  THen the problem is that you can't do math.  No speak-y English.  Word salad word salad word salad say the Supreme Court Injustices.
</p>

<p>All of the Centre for BioEthics Seminars, at Otago, were filmed for the Cameras.  So people, somewhere, could see the responses from the people attending the seminars.  THe seminars were about delightful things about how they were wanting to repeal the laws on medical experimentation, in New Zealand.  They wanted to do medical experiments on people with dementia and alzheimers who were not capable of providing consent.  THey wanted to repeal the laws requiring consent for participation.  I said that they should allow people to opt off.  So that I (now) could have it documented for peptuity that I did not consent to participate in medical research that I had not (myself) provided informed consent for participating in now, or any time into the future.  They said that no, they did not like that idea.  THey wanted to take the people who they weren't going to listen to them saying 'no' and do whatever they wanted to them.  Of course.  And the academics employed (on payroll) for the Centre for Bioethics at Otago. Well, they mask their faces and they hang their heads.  The psychology research seminars.  About how they were unlawfully detaining people and accusing them of crimes they had not done.  Refusing to read them their rights, refusing to tell them they could have a lawyer, refusing to supply a lawyer etc.  These are the graduate research seminars.  The only ones that get government funding, I suppose.  This is the state of New Zealand.
</p>

<p>Well then you should count yourself lucky if you manage to escape!  You should  be the very most grateful underpaid slave worker in Australia, then.  No?  WEll then they surely have teh right to abuse you and refuse to pay you and refuse to acknoweldge any of your work etc etc until you learn...  Uh... Learn what?  That there  is nothing here...  No value.  No meaning.  NO justice.  No education.  Nothing.  Nothing nothing to see.  Nothing here, people.  NOthing nothing nothing, at all.
</p>

<p>I mean, can you imagine what would happen if the NZ Government had something like a nuclear powerplant to maintain.  They'd start by appointing someone's kid to take half a million dollars per year to micromanage the mismanagement of the administration of managers and there simply wouldn't be enough money left to let the people with the capacity and willingness to do the work actually get on with it.  All eyes on me all eyes on me all eyes on me.  I love to talk I love to talk I love to talk.  All eyes on me.  Singing my praises, singing my praises, singing my praises.  Let's have a party.  Let the government pay for the alcohol to keep the workers happily happily happily putting out or doing anything I want whenever I want because I want.  I'm so glad they picked me!  For all the qualities that it is that they value!  Really serving the people, hey.  That's what it means to be a 'public servant' hey.  All of the money and none of the output.  Where are my Degrees?  You know, the graduate research qualifications that you give to people on the basis of their research output.  The primary function of universities.  What research output?  What Universities?  What students?  What curriculum?  What graduation?  What transcripts?  What references?  What hospital?  What judiciary?  Prison camps up and down the land.  The most under-developed economy in the world?  States aren't allowed to print their own money.  But Australia organises or arranges to withhold even NZ dollars from NZ workers after having arranged for NZ dollars to be printed on plastic in Canada. I believe.  The most unlawfully trafficked currency in teh world, apparently.  Surpassed only by the likes of bitcoin, I would suppose.

<p>https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/health/neurosurgeon-still-limbo-after-court-decision More garbage output from the courts.  New Zealand does not have neurosurgeons.  Won't pay them.  Won't put them in training programmes, won't progress them through the training programme, won't acknowledge completion of the training programme.  No training programme could be comparable to the training programme offered by New Zealand because New Zealand does not have a training programme.  No foreign graduate could have done the things required for domestic neurosurgeons because there are no things required.  There is no such thing.  There are no graduates.  There is no neurosurgery unit in Dunedin.  They collect up the money via fundraisers and then they spend the money on...  Um...  They spend the money on...  Uh.   They spend the money on...  Dirk having a yakkity yak yak to the delightful alumni who aren't plagued by neurodegenerative disease at all they are so delighted about the cloud like shapes that he says neurosurgeons see in the brain while they are operating.  It's all very delightful and he's so well dressed and well spoken.  Quite the charmer.  All eyes on him, all eyes on him, all eyes on him, all eyes on him.  Meanwhile there's one guy who knows how it's at where he can tell from the patient file notes...  Well, you don't need to read the patient file notes to know that the aim of the game is to kill (or at the very very least allow to die) as many people as possible.  I mean, if the glue factory can't take them away then the neuroshop should be able to do it.  Right?  I mean, if the ambulance officer (volunteers) don't get to them within 20 minutes (all voluntary like) then they aren't worth saving.  Probably they can tell from the file notes what blood type they are etc and whether their organs are worth harvesting.  Since we don't believe in informed consents and the like the only reason to keep people who are allegedly or apparently brain dead alive would be for the purposes of harvesting their organs or antibodies or the like.  Don't worry, I'm sure there's a perfectly well functioning centre for bio-ethics and regular inspections of the 'hospital'.  I'm sure that having 3 neurosurgeons on staff for a functioning unit (rather than one psychopath 'on staff' who will do anything anything anything?  Anything?  Anything that anybody tells him to do?)  I'm sure it's all above board and legit-like.  Since when did judicial review of administrative action get heard  by the *domestic* rather than *high* court?  The what, now?  The court?  The what?  Nobody cares if the registration people are possibly capable of delivering an objective decision.  The point is that they are not in fact.  Who signed them off?  The people who are refusing to sign off on other people...  What training do they have?  The answer to that is:  Next to nothing.  That's the problem.  They are not capable of training the next generation.  They don't know how they mangaged to squirmy worm their way into their present position but they know that they shouldn't have really been allowed to be there...  So they defend it and protect it against new arrivals, for sure.  I mean...  Who taught Kim Sterelny how to supervise research students?  Who taught him how to do that?  Who taught him how to research?  A lot of his early work was co-authored by Frank Jackson and the like.  Does it seem (on the basis of other work that has been done) that Kim Sterelny wrote most of it?  Or does it seem that Frank was being good to him helping him kickstart his career by including him in publications that he could have kept for himself?  Is kim able to discuss his earlier work -- or does he say that he won't talk about anything more than 3 years old because he doesn't really identify with it anymore?  What could the reason for that be, I wonder...

<p>How is Grant Gillett doing?  How old is he, now?  What is relevant is how many years of payroll he has had.  Is he still centre for Bioethics leader?  Does he still look like he's had his front teeth smashed out?  Is he showering?  Does he still look like he's had a stroke or somethign?  It would be impolite to mention these things or to say that there may be issues with his competence.  He was a neurosurgeon -- right? That's why he's head of BioEthics at Otago?  He was a neurosurgeon at Oxford?  Well, then, I'm sure he knows what's up with the ethics of the neurosurgery situation at Otago.  Apparently the thing of it is that neurosurgery operations are very time consuming (it is laboratious and difficult to open the skull without further damaging the brain) and most of the problems are things like car crash where the brain is basically mashed to a pulp.  So it is not obvious that doing anything will help anything at all.  So it's expensive and costly and laborious to do a bunch of stuff that isn't likely to prolonge the life of the person.  Even if you could prolongue the life of the person the quality of life is likely to be poor with bad damage so they may not be able to move  or speak.  The person may not be there anymore at all.  But of course they don't believe that there is anybody home at hte best of times, in Dunedin.  So, it might be fun for the 18 year old sons of the murdering raping pedophiles to play neurosurgeon for 5 minutes or 5 hours but they get sick and tired of that in next to no time at all.  So, you just need 1 guy to babysit them a little while they get the urge to play neurosurgeon out of their system and move along to finding their funsies in more interesting operations like sawing off people's femur in the  name of hip replacement or checking the cells in their cervix in the name of hip replacement or removing their fetus and selling it on the black market in the name of abortion of whatever.  Things that are easier and cheaper for the training people to arrange.

<p>I mean...  Would could neurosurgery be expected to do when there isn't functioning radiology?
</p>

<p>If there is neurosurgery I would imagine it would be done in the name of ENT.  Going up through the nose and swizzle sticking the frontal lobes in the name of fixing your nasal polyps.  No?
