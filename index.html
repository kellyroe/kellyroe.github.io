 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>The Tertiary Education Commission defines a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  
                            <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a>.  The writing tab shows that the University acknowledged having received my application to enrol in a 120 point MPhil with 05 March 2018 start date by their prescribed deadline.  The TEC approved the qualification as being 'right sized'.  They have the statutory function of approving qualifications and checking that the enrolment period (34 weeks) matches the FTE EFTS (1) also the points value (120).  But the University of Waikato is keeping records showing that they are not billing students in this manner, at all.  Shelley-Slade Gully (their award winning legal counsel) wrote me to explain that the University intended to 'hold me under zero fees' indefinately.  I think the name for that is 'detention camp'.  It is like they've had their eyes poked out.
                            </p>

                            <p>The University of Waikato believes they are entitled to require studnets to work for at least 12 months on their 120 point 1 EFT thesis before undergoing an external examination period of up to 3 months.  Since you are required to be enrolled at the end of the external examination period that means that if the examination period takes 3 months then you are required to be enrolled in and pay fees for an enrolment period of 12 months plus 3 months for a total of 15 months.  They took more than 3 months to examine my MA.  I think they only did examine it because I had already left the country.  But it doesn't stop there.  They believe that if the external examiners say anything about changes needing to be made to the substance (e.g., a reference to be added, a section to be moved around) then they are entitled to require the studnet to re-enrol for an additional 6 months and also undergo another external examination period of up to 3 months.  That means another 9 months added.  Basically forcing the student to repeat the f*cking year.  They say that the outcome of what they like to call 'first examination' is always that the student is required to pay fees for another 9 months.  This is fairly inevitable.  That is to say, they offer the 120 point qualification with the expectation that students will end up working for at least 12 months plus 3 months plus 6 months plus 3 months for a total of 24 months (2 years).  What happens then depends a  bit on the university.  Waikato has this 'option' for the university administration whereby the studnet takes another 2 1/2 months to make minor changes.  Find another reference.  Move a comma.  Etc.  The University administration believe they have discretion to force this -- else they can say the student failed to meet their requirements and the qualification is withheld.  
                            </p>

                            <p>Here is how much the Inland Revenue now says I owe the New Zealand Government for my 'Education' and 'Training' that are not acknowledged because New Zealand qualifications apparently expire 5 years post-graduation (well, not the Judges law degrees, apparently, but my qualifications have expired): 
                            <a href="judicial-review/ird-shot.pdf" target="_self"> $104,663.</a>  You can see, then, that New Zealand does not appear to have functioning Universities, they appear to have detention or forced labor camps.  They won't progress or process academic work (particularly research).  They refuse to get official documents (theses submitted for examination) to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit external examiners signing off on qualification completions.  There is no skilled labor workforce, in New Zealand, because New Zealand has a series or system of forced labor detention camps only.  You pay the University you pay the University you pay the University you pay the University.  Maybe they put you to work as an actor playing the part of a skilled professional.  Then, when you are done paying them, your qualifications are withheld.  They don't print Degrees, I would suppose, because they aren't worth the paper they are not even printed on, anymore.  They have an online records keeping system, now.  Right?  So when someone asks if you completed your qualification they can pretend they never heard of you (unless you pay the University you pay the University you pay the University).  Right?  So they can refuse to supply transcripts to people.  Unless they are murdering wrongful death bringing rapists and the like. I would suppose.  In which case they will write them glowing references because that is what it is that we value.  Right?
                            </p>

                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  They aren't progressing the filings. They are refusing to supply applications, refusing to process applications on their academic merits.  Apparently it isn't a matter of public interest how they pick and choose people to pass themsleves off as 'doctors' in our hospitals.
                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  Demanding me to pay more and more and more money to the courts else they force all my cases aborted, or abandoned.  <a href="judicial-review/sc-eyes.pdf" target="_self"> Here is the Judgement of the Supreme Court that I am attempting to appeal on the grounds that it is manifestly grotesquely unjust. </a>  It is like they have their eyes poked out.  Our highest court does not seem to have the conception of justice, at all.  It was the courts decision to delay Roe v University of Waikato proceedings until AFTER Roe v NZVCC and also until AFTER Roe v University of Auckland.  The Judge for Roe v NZVCC made all kinds of pronouncement in his judgment on the matter of Roe v University of Waikato.  That is to say instead of judging the issue he was supposed to be judging (the inaction of Chris Whelan in his capacity as CE of the NZVCC) he thought he would weigh in on whether or not I had done enough for completion of the MPhil Degree.  Clearly that is a matter of the Judge of a different case to decide!  
                            </p> 

                            <p>
                             <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  The Australian Constitution clearly names New Zealand as a state of Australia.  They say that they don't have to honor the constitution because New Zealand officials did not turn up to various things and they did not consent.  I don't know why Australia would care about consent in that instance.  Did they care about the consent of the Aboriginal people of Australia?  Did they care about consent of people to be immunised or subject to medical treatments or experimentation?  If they want to change the constitution then there is a process for it to be changed.  I think it involves a vote.  But New Zealanders don't get to vote so the Australian Government clearly does not care whether or not the people of New Zealand consent.  New Zealand functions as a detention camp of Australia.  But then, Australia still seems to govern like it is a detention camp of the Northern Hemisphere, so...
                            </p>

                            <p>Here are  <a href="judicial-review/sup-court-waikato.pdf" target="_self"> My Filings </a>to the Supreme Court regarding the University of Waikato    
                            </p>

                            <p>Una Jagose doesn't seem to have the job of instructing Crown Law to prosecute corruption within New Zealand Universities, or within the Judiciary (where judges refuse to accept evidence and where the supreme court punishes people for bringing injustices before the courts).  I suppose that is why they pay her more than half a million dollars to do that job.  They pay her to ensure the job is not done by anyone.  Not by her and not by anybody else.  The fact she is in the job prevents and prohibits the job being filled  by anyone with the willingness and ability to do the job.  It seems there is no evidence that they will accept that would attest to corruption.  None of the invoicing information that I provided (e.g., 0.5 EFTS = 120 points = 60 points = indefinate enrolment).  New Zealand does not appear to have a functioning judiciary.    <p> <a href="judicial-review/crown-law.pdf" target="_self"> Blow off response. </a>  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            <a href="judicial-review/adhbinterlocutory.pdf" target="_self"> My request for permission from the High Court to appeal their decision to award costs against me with respect to the ADHB having chosen to file motion to have my proceedings struck out rather than the ADHB having chosen to stop with involuntarily detaining people in conditions likey amounting to torture. </a>  They refused to grant me permission.  Here's how it goes.  A person complains via the appropriate channels.  The channels choose to employ people to throw away the complaints and delay progressing them and refuse to progress them.  The Privacy Commissioner, the Disability Commissioner, the Ombudsman.  The other Ombudsmans should have sued the Ombudsman for giving them a bad name.  Underminig their credibility and reputation.  He chooses to spend his time taking them to court instead of doing his job taking the government officials to court who are refusing to do theirs.  I don't suppose any of these people wouldn't be on Government Payroll if they did their job in a timely fashion.  Their job is to delay and obstruct and prevent and prohibit.  Then you complain to the courts.  The judge says that when I filed with the courts I 'forced' the District Health Board to file a motion to have my proceedings struck out.  That is what 'force' means, the judge thinks. That is absurd.  The standard form on the filings says explicitly that they are not required to file anything at all (they are not required to file a response to my filings and they certainly did not need to choose to file counter-filings.  The High Court Precedent from Roe v University of Auckland first case management conference was that one of the two judges present instructed the Universities external counsel not to file motion to have the proceedings struck out because the most expeditious way of dealing with my claims was to have a substantive hearing of the issues in the High Court.  Then the next High Court Judge says that in Roe v ADHB Ms Roe FORCED the ADHB to hire a QC to file motion to have my proceedings struck out.  New Zealand does not have a functioning judiciary.  THey unlawfully detain me in conditions the UN would likely say amount to torture (the Ombudsman vaccilates a bit on this issue but me mostly agrees that what they show to him in his regularly scheduled visits again and again and again likely amounts to torture.  Again and again and again and still.  Every year.  Every visit.  Every scheduled visit when they know in advance that he's coming.  He gets to go and see all the people being tortured.  And he gets to write about it.  And the New Zealand judicary again and again and again and again does precisely nothing.  I suppose that is why they are elected.  And I suppose that is why the New Zealand Government chooses to pay them.  Acknowledge their qualifications.  Pull retired judges out of retirement to write reports on how it is that the Univerisites of New Zealand have (at least 1) person they are being paid to look after who has been dead for over 1 month.  I wonder how many people recorded as 'students' or inpatients of the various hospitals and institutions of the New Zealand Government are actually literally physically dead.  The University of Waikato maintained they had 5 MPhil enrolments in 2018.  I don't believe them.  I think it highly likely indeed that they invoiced the government 5x for my enrolment.  They refused to supply to me information as to who the recipient of various scholarships were.  I think that is becuase they were not giving the scholarship money to any student.  Corruption.
                             </p>

                             <p>It doesn't appear to be limited to the University of Waikato.  Auckland and Otago are not processing applications, progressions though, and completions from Medical Degrees (or likely any other Degrees, either).  The courts say that it is not a matter of public interest that we don't have functioning health or legal systems, in New Zealand.  The Australian National University is also not processing enrolments properly.  I applied to start a PhD with them, again in 2022 to see how they would handle my application to enrol.  They decline it on grounds that I did not supply to them a research proposal or a writing sample therefore my application was deemed incomplete.  But this is garbage as my file notes that they sent me show that they had a link to my webpage where the 'Writing Tab' contained many writing samples (as you can see for yourself) including a book chapter with OUP and various theses of various lengths.  I simply don't believe that whoever they chose to enrol (or bill the Australian Government for having enrolled) was academically ranked higher than me.  I see that most of the other students who were at the ANU around the time that I was, before, for PhD, went on to have received credit for having completed the PhD.  I don't know if they were all forced to work over-time for how many years.  It seems that I was one of the few who was bullied into leaving without having received credit for the work that I did.  I have posted the work that I did during my enrolment there on the writing page.  My ANU records say, at one point, that my supervisor thought I would be done in 6 months.  That that was the state of my work.  He did not tell me that I should submit whatever I had in 6 months, though, and he did not provide concrete suggestions to me.  He did not provide supervisory meetings.  He was paid to supervise me.  That was his job.  He did not have to do any teaching.  His job was to do his own research and also to supervise his PhD students in their research.  So he wrote 'The Evolved Apprencice' and stopped signing his students off (particularly the New Zealand ones) so far as I can see...  New Zealand just functions as a detention camp for Australia.  But, then, I suppose Australia functions as a detention camp for the Northern Hemisphere, so.  No health system.  No judiciary.  No functioning economy.  Corruption.  Is it the lowest rate of successful prosecution of corruption related offences in the developed world?  That's how corruption is measured?  
                            </p>

                            <p>Party party party.  That's a good reason to do Philosophy.  Sure.  Be a rock-star.  Travel around the world.  Have your students hanging off your every word.  Take their work for yourself.  Pass it off as your own.  Bully them into fleeing.  Living the dream.  What it's all about.  Being so motivating and inspiring for a new generation of researchers.  That's all the very very best of the reasons to do Philosophy.  Sure.  But, hey, it isn't like Australasia has functioning science and technology either, so...  The prevention and prohibition of development programme.  For sure.  Cry cry cry cry cry for nuclear submarines.  Only 1/4 of the New Zealanaders are illiterate, according to Chris Hipkins.  He knows how to explain a graph.  If he loses it his job it will because it's only 1/4 -- right?  They can't even parse the Australian Constitution.  They can't do math.  University of Waikato math where 120 points = 1 EFT = 34 weeks = 1 academic year = 1 calendar year = 12 months thesis writing and then 3 months examination and then 6 months re-enrolment and then 3 months examination and then 10 weeks of changes and then indefinate enrolment while the external examiners take..  I know..  The rest of my life.  Right?  How long does it take for the University of Waikato to acknowledge completion of 1 year of research in 2018?  Maybe 3 generations after my death?  Too soon?  How about the Australian National University.  How long does it take them to identify a writing sample?  Just garbage garbage garbage output.  Nobody here.  Nothing home.  So..  Work hard people.  Yeah, right.  I'ts a real meritocracy.  Party party party.  Gaslighting garbage output.  It's soooooooo competitive.  The University of Waikato would have had one studnet apply to do the 120 point MPhil in 2018.  Me.  And the job of the University administration was to ensure that I not receive that qualification.  THey refused to process the application for enrolment, refused to get theses submitted for examiantion out to examiners, they refused to follow their own regulations.  They refused to do any of the things the Statutory Law of New Zealand states their job description is.  That's the nature of the competition.  The competition is the race to the bottom where instead of people working to become doctors and lawyers etc.  People work to eliminate all the doctors and lawyers etc.  New Zealand doesn't have skilled workers.  It pays people to ensure that skilled workers cannot function here.  We don't print transcripts because they are not worth the money they are not even printed on.  New Zealand Universities cannot keep secure online records (why would we think they had the capacity to do that?)  They aren't even capable of coherent invoicings.  They double-bill qualifications thehy can't even keep accurate enrolment records.  New Zealand has the lowest perceived rate of corruption because we don't prosecute corruption related offences because we don't have a functioning judiciary.  We don't even seem to have judges.  Nobody has the ability to re-hire retired judges, so far as I can see.  The process for appointing new judges doesn't mean that Mander and Toogood get hauled out of retirement because they are trusted to do cover-up and there won't be any consequences internationally (what are they going to do -- fire them?  They are supposed to be retired already hahahahhahahahahahahaha).  Wow.  New Zealand.  Nobody in their right mind would volutarily choose to be born or be a citizen of here.  Detention camp of Australia.  Detention camp of the world.  That's what soverignty meeeeeeeean.  Yeah, right.  WOuldn't you rather be Sterelny's little b*tch, then?  Party party party with Sterelny and look after his kid?  That's the function of old women.  Right?  To look after men's babies.  The meaning of life.  Right there.  The only thing allowed to persist.  Huddle into the fitness trap.  Get really comfy.  There's no philosophy here.  No meaning, no justice, no truth, nothing.  NOthing nothing nothing at all.  No University.  No health system.  Nada.  Zip.  Zilch.  Zero.  They chose their special children (Dr Leeks and the various other people they thought would continue on his good works) and they shipped them here so they could rule over the land...  Cry cry cry cry cry for nuclear submarine handouts.  Nothing to see, here.
                            </p>

                            <p>Apparently the elite don't have to worry because people use the ring of Gyges against the poor and sick and weak people (who are not other elites like themselves) only.  The judges bow before justice when they are hearing casees involving elites, and everybody bows before them, otherwise.  They use the ring only on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.  They provide healthcare to the elites.  Sure they do.  Course they do.  Yeah, right.  That's what healthcare is.  That's what justice is.  That's what education means.  You provide education to the elites and work to stabotage and undermine those regarded as not elite.  Of course.  It isn't that there isn't any justice or education or health.  It is that I'm part of the out-group who has been ostracised or outcast as non-person because I didn't like to party party party, or I didn't want to take up my role of looking after your kids.  Right.  Sure.  You totally grasped the subject matter of philosophy.  Meaning.  Value.  Word salad word salad word salad built into the constitution right from the very outset.  You have been consented for euthanasia but you don't want to be part of Australia.  You want to be an offshore detention camp.  Course.  Course you do.
                            </p>

                            <p>And if there is one lesson we really must learn it's that speaking up makes things worse.  Right?  So now we expect to see visibly Aboriginal Australians transported from Australia into the detention camp that is New Zealand.  It isn't like we are removing them from Australia -- right?  We just take away their Australian Passports and ensure they never board a plane back to Australia.  The Australian way.  Right?  To ensure the prevention and prohibition of education and so on and so forth.  The Australian National University has evidnece that they refused to properly process an application to enrol.  What are they doing about it?  It's been brought to the attention of the Vice Chancellor who chose to direct that it then go before 2 Deans.  Apparently they are processing it.  But they won't agree to work to a timeline...  Here's the thing...  If you know that this is how they conduct their business...  Then I don't understand or see how anybody would or could choose to do business with them.  I mean...  If they won't progress my application (when they don't have legitimate grounds not to) then what is to stop them not progressing anybody else's?  I mean, why would you even apply there when even if they did accept your application they likely won't ever give you any credit for work you do or graduate you etc.  And what are we to make of the people who apparently or supposedly got PhD's from there?   No justice.  No fairness.  The great plan to eliminate humanity.  The great extinction plan.  Right, Sterelny?  I suppose that is right.  The best reason we have for thinking that nobody has nuclear capacity or capability to destroy countries or continents or planets is becuase they are still here.  If we actually had the capacity to do that we would have done it, already.  The world that you made.
