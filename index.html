 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container"> 

                            <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/490864/hackers-selling-access-to-school-it-systems-cyber-security-firm-says  Oh noes the hackers must have done it!  How much will Stuart McCutcheon 2.0  pay to say 'wasn't me -- must've been the hackers!!'.  
                            </p>

                            <p>Make a little 'submit' button 'application to graduate' with a script saying the applicant doesn't pass the bot test.  Oh noes!  Must have been the hackers!!!  Must be the Russians.  'There could be no application that could be received such that...'  We can't see anything wrong.  Did you see something wrong Chris Whelan?  Justice Toogood?  Una Jagose?  When does your voluntary retirement take effect, Una?  I thought you were standing down over the role you played in destruction of evidence and obstruction of justice etc etc in the investigation into abuse in state care.  </p>

                            <p>The hackkers must have destroyed all the consent forms.  Must have been the hackers.  The hackers must have destroyed all the prescriptions.  Made it impossible for anybody to obtain a medical registration number.  What medical registration?  Where is the list of individuals autorised to write medical prescriptions in NZ?  Oh noes!!  Must be the hackers!!  What health records?  What education records?  What judiciary?  Oh noes!!! Must have been the hackers!!!</p>

                            <p>LET ME TELL YOU A STORY</p>

                            <p>Our story begins with a hospital online records system that is configured such that a change in login requires a system restart and the person trying to login needs to wait...  However many minutes...  Before they are logged in and able to access patient notes, for example.  So...  Someone sneaks up behind you when you are logged in and says 'hey, can you just dig this out for me quickly?' and it would be rude not to -- right?  Like someone trying to tailgate on your authorisation on your way into the hospital or the operating theatre...  </p>

                            <p>You don't need to hold guns to people's head to get them to log in using their credentials (e.g., Medical Doctors or Surgeons or whomever updating information about drugs to be given and surgeries to be performed).  You can get them doing a little internship and see how willing they are to  be 'friendly' and 'helpful' and 'courteous' and to  be a 'team player' and so on...  With the promise that it's okay.  They can simply arrive to work, log into the system, then go play golf.  Get out of here.  Go away.  We have all aspects of 'patient flow' in hand.  Thanks.  See ya.</p>

                            <p>You can see who the tail-gaiters are quite clearly from the security cameras that you have positioned over the doors. Who would do that.  Who would go in through a door without swiping in when it is supposed to be swipe access only.  I don't care if someone holds the door open for you, you are supposed to swipe in regardless so the green beep authorisation is recorded on the security camera trained over the door.  So there is no security alarm triggered for unauthorised access.  LMFAO.  What part of 'complicit in the crimes' or 'were required to participate in crimes' is so f*cking hard to understand?</p>

                            <p>Oh yeah.  It was the hackers.  Yeah, right.</p>

                            <p>About 90 per cent of security breeches are 'soft' breeches.  By which they mean the above kinds or sorts of things.  In order to be selected to 'work' that job at all you need to write down your password and leave it on the post it note in front of your work-station.  That kind of thing.  Then we can cry cry cry cry cry about the hackers.  The hackers must have done it.  The hackers must have destroyed all the consent forms we never obtained.  And so on.  The hackers must have photo-shopped the video camera footage of all the unauthorised unscrubbed people with no medical training committing various atrocities in supposed 'operating theatres'.  Uploaded in 4k no doubt.  Yeah. The hackers made us do it.  Yeah, right.</p>

                            <p>ffs.  The dumb and f*cking dumber show.  Not even trying to  be fair, at all.</p>

                            <p>Never was there any better reason to believe in the singularity!  It wasn't me!  I wasn't the one to deliver the euthanasia drug without the consent.  Must've been the singularity!  The hackers must have done it.  There was a consent for them there yesterday, when I logged in with your authorisation number..  I swears...</p>

                            <p>It wasn't me sending invoicing the government for keeping Mason Pendrous in a residential  hall for around 1 month after he died.  Must have been the hackers.  The singularity that's taken control of the hospital system and education system and health system.  Pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the university and the hospitals so they can employ people to go play golf while the singularity does robot surgery.  Let's all stop for a system update.  Where did the surgeon go?  Oh,  he's working from home somewhere in a detention camp in Australia..  Maybe an outback prison camp over there...  Someone is standing with a gun to his head getting him to enter his logon details and he's responsible for moving the surgical arm..  Oh no, that's right.  The singularity must have done it.  The singularity is responsible.  It was wrong of us to think that Dr Leeks was responsible for any of the things that he did.  He had been taken over by the singularity.  Obviously.  Never was there any better reason to believe in intelligent AI than various individuals wanting to absolve themselves of responsibility for their crimes.  Right Una?  </p>

                            <p>They probably should send out letters to people to inform them that they have  been placed on wait lists for various surgeries.  They had to put them on a wait-list, apparently, because the actual surgeries were prioritised for people who wouldn't consent - so they had to obtain a court order to do the procedure under urgency.  They needed to give custody of a kid to a surgeon so he could do an operation quickly quickly against the wishes of the mother.  So quickly quickly that there wasn't time for another surgeon (sourced from overseas) to testify as to the necessitiy of the operation at all.  Whether the kids heart valve might grow as he does since heart valves still grow -- until they have been surgically replaced by synthetic ones in which case the heart valves will not grow and need to be replaced again and again...  Quickly quickly do all the non-consenting ones under urgency emergency.  Throw people who want operations onto wait lists..  Only I think what you are most likely to find is that it will be news to some that they were placed on wait lists for surgery at all.  I mean to say that this will be the first some will have heard about them having been signed up as volunteers, supposedly, for whatever procedures they have been signed up for.  For more and more and more and more billings for the hospital.  How many people on the wait list have died already?  How many operations are carried out on dead bodies.  For more and more and more and more and more billings for the hospital.  What hospital?  Where are the consent forms?  Filed in triplicate.  Right?  The patient has a copy.  The hospital  has a copy.  The government has a copy.  Right?  If we are recording that people have been enrolled in programems they never applied to (if we are billing people as being enerolled in programmes when they are literally dead)...  What kind of a cluster-f*ck is the hospital?  What hospital?  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  They can't even identify unauthorised access of the hospital.  I mean medical student laboratory.  I mean University.  I mean prison detention camp.  Atrocities.   Nobody was held to account for atrocities in NZ and Australasia near the end of WWII and the atrocities never stopped.</p>

                            <p>Such delightful bio-ethics seminars at Otago.  I particularly loved the couple of Americans who came to NZ and informed the bio-ethics people that they were campaigning for law change so that they could run medical experiments on elderly people in state care institutions and so on without their consent.  The idea  being that they were recorded as having dementia or alzheimers therefore whatever they said they wanted pertaining to their care was ignored  because they were not in the position to consent.  So they wanted to run experiments on them.  In some cases they could find their children or whomever to sign consent for them to be a participant in whatever scientific research study to help people.  But they wanted the default to be consent.  So that they didn't need to ask consent from people who had been declared to be not capable of providing it.  I asked them specificially, if they wanted to change the law to allow for this, to allow people to sign, in advance, a declaration that they did NOT CONSENT to be experimented on now or at any point in the future, once the only people put on government payroll to decide who is not capable of consenting voluntarily say that anybody who does not consent is not capable of giving consent.  Therefore they have been consented...</p>

                            <p>They refused to allow there to be an opt off.  That is where we are explicitly, now, in NZ -- right?  The government and law are being very clear that NZers do not have any right at all to not consent or not be subject to scientific experimetnation in the name of medical research or whatever.  Of course, we also apparently don't have the right to justice.  Says the judiciary.  They are refusing to deliver judgment on the Ministry of Social Developmetns proclamation that justice is not an essential need.</p>

                            <p>I don't know who would volutarily choose to vote for a government who refuses to acknowledge the right of the people to not be experimented on and who works only to prohibit and prevent justice.  I don't think the only government acknowledged by foreign powers cares whether the people consent or not.  You wouldn't get to be acknowledged as Prime Minister otherwise -- right?  Jacinda voluntariliy chose to resign (to walk away from more than two hundred-thousand per year) to be 'umemployed'.  Yeah, right. </p>

                            <p> https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/education/otago-university-withheld-extent-of-financial-straits-from-staff/  There is this guy from Otago who does management and health stuff.  He was writing about how it was an aspirational ideal for the Canturbury District Health Board to claim to have deficit and to record a deficit in their budget year after year after year.  The government kept throwing out the Board because they were refusing to try to work within the operational budget.  They just would not do it.  They insisted on recording that they were operating over budget every year.  They insisted on recording and reporting a loss that they were running in deficit.  I think it was something about what it means to be a public rather than private hospital or something.  This guy has a thing about it.  About it being ideal to run at a deficit and that was a huge part of what the Canterbury District Health Board thought they should be doing.  Now they are rolling that out for Otago University.  They aren't trying to be a Public Ivy, or similar, anymore.  THey aren't trying to pretend to have endowment or money behind them.  They have changed their tune, since Harlene Hayes left, to saying that they are running at a loss.  Now, the Canterbury district health board had 'interesting' ways of cooking the books to report running at a loss.  They were doing funny strange things with building depreciation, for example.  Instead of recording property increasing in value over time (property prices seemed to be rising for everone else, right?) they were recording depreciation only.  So any asset they spent money on was hemmorrrhaging money only.  The way they chose to report things.  Whereas Otago University was similarly about build build build more and more and more residential hall slums (without basic access to food storage or adequate bathroom space to prevent spread of disease) was supposedly the..  Healthiest?  MOst financially profitable?  Governmetn instituion.  Wasn't it?  Otago was apparently or supposedly in robust health.  Compared to all the other Universities etc etc..  But now the think-tank behind Canterbury reporting loss after loss after loss after loss (with new-build hospital meaning they were most poor) now Otago University is cry cry cry cry crying about how poor it is.  Poor them.  It's the same guy..  I don't know if he is merely reporting someone else's bright idea of how to manage or fiddle the books or if it actually is his bright idea...  I kind of think they should get independnet audiors in but that would involve accounting qualifications and they can't even process applications to enrol or graduations.  Must be the hackers... </p>

                            <p>All the Universities were fiddling their books.  Not recording student enrolments properly.  Double (and then some) billing for graduate studnets, particularly.  Also not paying out scholarships they were supposed to.  NZ Universities do not publish lists of academic merit based scholarships anymore.  I think this is because they are not awarding them to students.  The University administration is taking them.  I guess the idea is that they can advertise a job paying $80,000 as a 'scholarships advisor' and you only need to stiff students out of $80,000 of scholarship funding for the 'University' to be getting their money's worth from you.  Finalise enrolments before scholarships and then never pay out the scholarships.  I asked, repeatedly for Waikato to supply a list of receipents of their $5,000 masters research thesis awards (along with GPA cut off)  because I didn't think they were actually handing them out to studnets at all.  They wouldn't supply the information.  I asked the Waikato DHB to supply information as to who was given their Masters Thesis scholarships.  THey won't supply the information.  The money isn't going to students at all.  Corruption.  Corruption.  Corruption.  Then the DHB or the university takes the research output and bullies the studnet into fleeing without even getting their work out for external examination.  There's nothing there.  NObody home.  Not even trying to be fair at all. What Univesrity? What district health board?  Corruption.  Corruption.  Corruption.</p>

                            <p>Oh, I see.  Otago didn't meet their 'savings targets' which means they are 'running at a loss'.  They have a deficit from how much money they made and how much money they wanted to make.</p>

                            <p>I don't understand how you can do business in a nation that doesn't have a functioning judiciary in this jurisdiction.</p>

                            <p>I would be interested for someone to do a piece on what John Reynold's son is doing now.  From the Department of Anatomy.  I wasn't sure whether it was Bryan Hyland's son (or maybe grand-son) who was brought before the courts of Sydney on a couple occasions before apparently being thrown out of their medical school for repeatedly beating his girlfriend..  But I don't know how your son can grow up okay, John Reynolds, when the likes of you and Bryan Hyland and Peter Crampton are wanting to take responsibility for together amongst yourselves throwing away applications from Medical School before they are considered by the Medical Admissions Committee on the basis of their Academic Merits.  Nobody home.  I swears.  Or maybe they hoping he will voluntarily resign.  I guess the Queensland VC must have had his email hacked when he asked if there was any way his daughter could be enrolled in Medicine with Queensland which would, of course, have meant throwing away someone else's application so that she could be the only game in town.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                            <p>What we want to see, from AUstralasian Universities are COMPLETED RESEARCH PROJECTS.  Every single studnet who has applied to be enrolled in a 120 point programme of study is supposed to have their work sent out to external examiners in time for them to complete the qualification.  IT ISN"T SUPPOSED TO BE THAT F*CKING HARD.  EVERY SINGLE ASSIGNMENT, AS AN UNDERGRADUATE, PHYSICALLY POSTED INTO THE PHYSICAL POSTING BOX BY THE DEADLINE.  That was only one of the things that I did, as an undergrad, to get my GPA.  Then, when you get to graduate student level, the university just f*cking won't do it.  I tell you what.  Screaming f*cking tantrums.  Will not get the work out for examination.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  </p>

                            <p>The Research thesis should have the enrolment dates in them.  So that people can see what projects are coming out of the University.  I can tell you what.  Next to f*cking nothing.  Re re re re re re re re re re re enrolled.  More and more and more and more and more money from the University so they can pay the stupid f*cking retards not willing or able to produce research of their own to prevent and prohibit anybody else from doing that, either.  Nothing there, I f*cking swear.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>
