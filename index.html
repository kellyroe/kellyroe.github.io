                            <p> <a href="writing/LAW 121B.pdf" target="_self">Law exam.</a>  </p>

                            <p>The 'University' of Auckland offers a public or population health paper that they recommend for studnets with arts / law background.  They say that it is specifically designed to be 'language rich'.  I wrote essays...  On food security and I don't remember what else.  They gave me 30 per cent per essay and recorded that I failed the course.  Not because I don't have language skills -- but because the aim of the course seemed to be to identify people who did in order to fail them.  I don't know how many others were recorded as having failed that paper.  I went to all the lectures and tutorials, did all the readings for the course, honestly engaged with the content, and was failed out of the course.  Apparently they get to pick and choose whoever they want for whatever reasons they want.  They simply didn't choose me.  They didn't want me at the 'University' unless I was going to to along for all the 'extra-help' where the tutor would, basically, write the script for me.</p>

                            <p>Look into who the NZ Universities are failing.  They blame Covid -- but that doesn't seem likely to me, the way things are going.  Look at how many people have 'incomplete' or whatever recorded against their name becuase the 'University' refused to get their work out to external examiners.  The 'University' said that it wouldn't go out to externals becuase they were afraid it was going to be failed -- so they decided not to sent it out at all and simply record that the studnet had failed in advance.  In other words, they aren't sending the work out not becuase they believe it will be failed.  But because they believe it will be passed.</p>

                            <p>What 'University'?</p>

                            <p>You have to look at the reason why a Statute was passed.  Typically there is a class or group of persons that the statute is trying to protect.  So, for example, the start of the Education and Training Act describes how domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible to be enrolled in the programme they have applied to.  THe intention of the statute seems to be to inform the 'Universities' that they are supposed to be engaging in tertiary or adult education, primarily.  WHy say, in Statute that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible?  Because if it didn't say that then the 'Universities' might be tempted to fill up the training places with teenagers or foreigners or both.  That seems to be what the Statute is trying to prevent or prohibit.</p>

                            <p>But then the 'Universities' cry 'wah wah wah we don't have enough applications from domestic adults to fill up the quotas we need to train a certain number of doctors and so on every year otherwise we will be stuck with these 80 year +++ pedophiles because there will be no alternative'.  So the Statute says then, trying to protect the teenagers, that the 'University' may enrol them -- but only if the University is persuaded that they have the ability to actually pass the programme they are enrolled in.  Then the focus is on how they can be assured that they will pass the programme.  Their school grades.   </p>

                            <p>Was the point of the statute that if the 'Universities' could market university as being fun fun fun fun fun party party with the administration that the 'Universities' could throw away applications from domestic adults who had attained the age of 20?  I think it is pretty f*cking obvious to the anyone with reading comprehension that it was not.</p>

                            <p>So what is the fate of the studnets who are under the age of 20 who the University enrols only because they weren't able to fill up the programme with domestic adults...</p>

                            <p>Wait a minute...  I applied to study a 120 point MPhil with Waikato in 2018 and I applied by the appilcation deadline.  But they refused to enrol me in the programme I applied to.  They said I applied 'too late'.  But (1)  they altered the date on my application.  They simply changed it and said I applied too late.  WHen I supplied evidence of my application being aknowledged as received by them by the deadline (I got an auto acknowledgement from the computer system so I had evidence that they manually went in there and falsified the date on the document) they still insisted to the Judge that I applied 'too late'.  </p>

                            <p>I was the only person to have applied to that programme.</p>

                            <p>ffs.  What university?</p>

                            <p>Where is the research output of the academics whose 'primary function is research'?  </p>

                            <p>How old is...  Rosalind Hursthouse?  Robert Nola...  Go through the 'University' of Auckland Philosophy Department and idenfify who is over the age of 65.  Time to go ffs.  Get the f*ck out.  "There wil be a job for you only over our dead bodies".  Well,  hurry up and die, then.  F*cking hell.  Just die, already.</p>

                            <p>Hey, you'll have to hire an American.  Nobody actually from NZ has the willingness or ability to to Philosophy jobs.  Hey, I know, let's get Brett Calcott to marry and American and then we can employ the American to teach Philosophy of Biology at Auckalnd because clearly and obviously Brett (the New Zealand Citizen) wouldnt' be willing and or able to work that job.  </p>

                            <p>Did any of the doctoral students from the Australian National Univeristy have their work sent out for external examination?  I ask because I didn't see anybody provide an oral defence to external examiners, and I didn't see anybody's external examienrs reports of their thesis.  I remember NIck Southwood saying that his thesis had been accepted by externals without them requesting any changes at all.  I was very surprised to hear that.  It is human psychology for examiners to request at least one change, I would have thought.  To feel like they had done their job properly, at least.  Added value to the thing in some way.  Made at least one suggestion of how it could be better.  Now I wonder if it was ever sent out for external examination, at all.</p>

                            <p>My work was not sent out for external examination, that's for sure.  What supervision did I recieve?  Meetings?  Instructions for me?  When should I get you writing?  What comments do you have on my writing?  Do you want me to summarise readings?  The Government paid people to supervise me, right?  Where is the evidnece of supervision?  The burden of proof is on me to establish that I was not offered supervision.  Shall I give you all the emails I have, then, so you can read them all and proclaim no evidnece of supervision?  What evidence of supervision do you find in your outbox?  Stupid f*ckign retards.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>Kim Sterelny writes 'The Evolved Apprentice' which is some kind of slavery manifesto, one can only suppose.  About how he acts like a f*cking ape expecting people to go away on camping trips or house sit while he goes away on family trips.  What evidence of supervision?  When did he get my work out for external examination if he was too busy or lazy to do the job for which he was paid?  What evidence is there of him helpling me with my thesis?  Ooooh.  It's soooooo competitive!  Soooooo competitive!!!! We best be falling over each other, then, who gets to party party party with him.  It's soooooo competitive.  It's sooooo competitive there simply isn't anything there, at all,  hey.  What evidence of supervision?  If you aren't going to be helpful then get it out to externals then.  Aka:  Get out the f*cking way, mate.  Is he f*cking well dead, yet?  F*cking hell.  Still on payroll, hey.  Alllll the payroll for him.  It's soooooo competitive.  How many years you keep Carl Brusse enrolled and re enrolled and re enrolled handing over more than 10 years doctoral work because it's soooooo competitive.  F*cking psychopath.  What philosophy?  There isn't anything there.  Took all the philosophy out of the curriculum.  What curriculum?  F*cking psychopaths.  No teachign responsibilities at alll. It had one job to do (supervise doctoral studnets) and it still couldn't / wouldn't do it.  F*cking psychopath.  It's soooooooo competitive.... </p>
