 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>Hey I know..  I should seek 'external litigation funding' to have my cases heard through the court of appeal.  I know who I should approach.  The law firms.  Assuming the Universities of NZ will keep the same firm through the court of appeal proceedings as they had represent them in the high court...  I suppose that the legal fees are higher than 1/2 the costs.  So, then, if Thompkins wake loans me 1/2 the costs so I can lodge security for costs then they will make court of appeal legal fees out of the University.  Worst case they will be able to payroll their workers on that case.  How many billable hours did the high court proceedings take?  So Ms Roe's value, then, for the work that she does...  Uh...  Yeeeeeeeeeeeah...</p>

                                <p>So I heard  back from the Office of the Ombudsman.  It takes about 1 year for the Office to process a compliant to a final outcome which is apparently not binding in law.  The outcome is most often that the Office of the Ombudsman does not see anything wrong.  So, then, what is the value of the Office of the Ombudsman?  It is a bit unclear to me.  I have read some of the reports that the Office has made about the state of our hospitals.  I have read how the Ombudsman has given them weeks to months of advance warning of an inspection and has walked only the route they took him down (has not checked out the back rooms, I mean to say).  There are glaring ommissions.  For example, him saying that one aspect of the food had been praised when he said nothing at all about the food provided in the 'most secure' wards with no visitors (e.g, the secure psych unit which is on a different food contract).  Anyway, sometimes (even with all that) he does write that there is unlawful use of detention and seclusion in conditions that the UN would likely say amount to torture.  That things are unnecessarily punative and / or abusive.  And of course he writes this over and over and absolutely nothing is done to improve things because the whole idea aim purpose or point seems to be to have the Ombudsman help us normalise or come to understand that it's perfectly normal and perhaps even an aspirational goal to unlawfully involuntarily detain and torture I don't know how many people per head of population.  What's the aim for psychiatry?  Twenty five percent?  More? Less?  </p>

                                <p>Anyway...  I asked the University of Auckland to inform me how much money they chose to spend on Bell Gully legal representation to defend their decision not to process my application to Medicine (MBChB) in 2019 and again in 2020 on the basis of it's academic merits - same as everybody else's was supposed to.  Where GPA (calculated according to their published algorithm), UMAT or UCAT score (on year of application, test depending on year of application), and interview score jointly determine the rank order score of candidates.  They insisted on miscalculating my GPA (to tell me I wasn't good enough) and then saying I was 'ineligible' to have applied -- even though the Education and Training Act declares that as a domestic adult who has attained the age of 20  years I am eligible to be enrolled in the progarmme of study I have applied to, however.</p>

                                <p>Instead of processing my application same as everybody else's was supposed to have been processed and offering me enrolment if and only if my rank order score was high enough they chose to hire Bell Gully Lawyers to defend their right to declare domestic adults to be 'ineligible' and simply throw applications away.  So that they could expediate 'training' various people who.  Uh.  Well, they are telling us that we haven't been actually training a workforce at all.  We don't have any senior clinicians.  We have a bunch of war criminals only.  Declared war on the NZ people, they did.  Unlawfully involuntarily detaining them and abusing them in the schools and prisons and hospitals...</p>

                                <p>Anyway..  The University of Auckland didn't want to make public the information about how much in billings Ms Roe brought to Bell Gully over this.  How much they chose to pay Bell Gully to try and have the courts declare that they could enrol or not enrol whomever they wanted for whatever reasons they wanted.  Fitzgerald said I was eligible by statute but then gave teeth to the University not having to follow the statutory law,  you see.  So that means in order for justice things will need to be heard in the court of appeal.  That would be more expensive for the University to keep hiring lawyers for htat one?  They want to do that?  That's the amount of money they are happy to pay to have the courts re-assert that the University of Auckland is not functionng as a Uni at all.  Not processing applications according to academic merits.  Not even trying to be fair.  Throwing applications away on non-academic grounds.</p>

                                <p>Hiring a top firm to defend youself against a non-lawyer self represented litigant...  THat's the kind of thing that guilty people do.  Right?  Else...  Ms Roe must really be a force to be reckoned with.  How much in billings did she bring to Bell Gully?  Not so much as a christmas party invitation...  Pffffft.</p>

                                <p>Put that on my CV shall I.  The lengths we go to to ensure the prevention and prohibition of psychiatry and medicine and so on... </p>

                                <p>Actually, you know what the worst of that one was? The very first case management conference I was able to say that the University of Auckland in-house counsel (they started trying to use that gettting Rebecca Ewert to do their filings for them) missed a filing deadline.  Did not respond to my filings by the appropriate deadline.  THe one written on page..  One or maybe two of my standard template filings.  INstead she attempted to lodge some other thing.  She did not do what she was supposed to do, she spent her time doing something unnecessasry I mean to say...  So...  The Rules of the High Court say that when one of the parties fails to respond by the deadline that things 'may proceed in their absence'.  I can hear the difference between 'must' and 'may'.  I asked the court to allow things to proceed in the absence of counsel for the University of Auckland.  They could simply choose not to repond to my filings.  Because they are civil, you see.  So they could simplly not respond to my filings if they think I'm vexatious or that I don't have any evidence in support of that which I speak.  Simply trust the Justice system to dispose of things.  </p>

                                <p>So the Justice (or Injustice) at that first case management conference (there were two of them actually).  One of them says 'don't worry Bell Gully representative it won't be a Jury trial it will be judge decided'.  And the other of them says 'that (having things continue in the absence of a party who missed a filing deadline) is not how we do things'.  But perhaps it is how you should do things.  Because the Judges decision to grant the University of Auckland an extention on their filing deadline resulted in the Universiety of Auckland needing to?  Being allowed to???  Being expected to??  Hire external legal counsel.  At no point did the University try and sort things out amicably with me so that there wouldn't need to be legal action.  It was all snigger snigger what do you think the courts are going to do.  Which was also the attitude of the Universities of Otago, Waikato, and the NZVCC.  Not even trying to be fair.  Any of them.  How much in billings did Ms Roe bring to the other firms?  Thompkins Wake?  Mr Sim..  I don't remember the firm...  What a f*cking farce.  What a f*cking sh*t show.  What Universities?  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camps.  There's nothing there.  And the Judiciary..  Uh..  I guess they are supposed to be staffed by University Graduates.  Uh.   Yeah...  Riiiiight....</p>

                                <p>______</p>

                                <p>   https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/131664594/two-senior-psychiatrists-at-hillmorton-hospital-quit-amid-issues-with-staffing-and-safety  Uh...  The problem is that the 'trained psychiatrists' who have been the 'only game in town' over the last few decades have done nothing to develop psychiatry in NZ.  Instead, they seem to have functioned as obstacles or placeholders.  They have done nothing to improve the state of the buildings.  They have done done nothing to ensure the units were properly staffed.  They have gone along to their prison camp detention facilities not fit for purpose and either participated in else done absolutely nothing abot the various crimes being committed within the units they are responsible for.  They will have to f*cking well die before a skilled workforce will be acknowledged or allowed to develop at all. Over their dead bodies.  They aren't going to walk away from their pay cheques voluntarily.  Unless an opening came up for them in Australia.  They can go 'staff' the prison camps over there, now?  Go keep Aborininals imprisoned in the desert, or something.  I don't believe they voluntariliy resign for a minute.  Redeployed someplace else.  NZ doesn't have psychiatry.  Prison detention camps up and down the land.  'Only 'treat' the involuntary non-voluntary non-consenting those screaming at you to stop'.  The 'psychiatry' facilities are so full of people who are there because they don't want to be there there is apparently nothing left to help the people actually asking for help. The whole thing seems intentionally set up to be punative only.  We haven't even got to the point of the 'helping professions'.  Punative government institutions of abuse.  The 'education' and 'health' systems etc.  Not trying to train a workforce at all.  Not even trying to be fear.  Like they've had their eyes poked out.  </p>

                                <p> 'Information is power, she says. "If you hold information that others don't, therefore you have an upper hand, you have leverage. You have the ability to pick and choose your moves before anyone else'.  Huh.  That is an interesting point of view, isn't it.  I guess that's why there must be dumbing down of the curriculum and trying to keep as many others as stupid as possible for as long as you are getting away with it.  It being soooo competitive hierarchy and all.  Quite the attitude for a public civil servant.  Prevention and prohibition of social development.  Undermining the education and health sectors etc.  P P P P Psychopaths....  </p>

                                <p>  https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/486980/aukus-participation-talks-highlight-new-zealand-s-nuclear-free-status  LMFAO.  By the time the administrators children have taken up all the nuclear physics training positions and jobs (because it sounds really cool and really smart) Rocket Lab and so on will simply source all it's skilled labor from the USA and.. Uh...  Yeah.  There's nothing here.  What nuclear physics progamme? Lol.  I mean..  YOu can simply redeploy the physicists to Epidemiology.  Right?  It isn't like either of those are actually trained skilled knowledgeable professions in their own right.  Redeploy Ashley to teach the medical students bio-physics?  Why not!  You can get the physicist teaching the medical students..  No?  Teaching epideiology.  Public Health?  Why not.  Don't have any skilled labor positions that could not be filled by generatlists.  Generals.  Redeployed from elsewhere.  Unskilled unpaid workers.  'Workers'.  Yeah, right.</p>

                                <p>   It goes as far as imagining, long term, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) "with necessary safeguards" to provide or analyse information, or even to determine "simple procedural applications" such as time extensions and routine management orders.  From:  https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/486974/new-strategy-to-guide-use-of-technology-in-courts-launched  Oh.  I bet it does, I bet it does.  It goes like this:  'There could be no evidence supplied that would attest to' (e.g., corruption within the NZ government.  Chatbot stuff like that.  Not accepting filings.  Not accepting evidence.  Etc.  Why bother to graduate lawyers at all?  Why register anybody in the law profession?  Do you even?  Yeah, uh..  Um...  Riiiiiiiiiiight...  </p>

                                <p>BTW Dame God Person..  Apparently you used to be a fashion model, which makes you a shoe-in for Law.  Given certain prime time viewing shows motivating and inspiring generations...  Anyhoo...  Where do you buy a nice tailored pin-stripe suit these days?  With seams matching up?  Now...  Maybe I'm delusional...  But I feel like if they shink their bolts of cloth before-hand then the occasional cold wash should be okay (so no dry cleaning needed).  But maybe I'm missing something??  What am I missing, here?</p>

                                <p>  https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/486905/maori-historian-ross-calman-granted-honorary-doctorate-for-work-revitalising-te-reo  Uh...  Why didn't he enrol in a PhD programme and earn an actual doctorate.  Instead of being granted an 'honorary' one out of the kindness of their hearts, I mean to say.  Oh.  Is earning one not actually an option.  Yeah.  Makes sense.</p>

                                <p>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/lawyer-who-ignored-vulnerable-clients-barred-from-practicing-for-two-years/NNQ4FGJVYNCPJAJBJOBWMMOI2E/  Two year ban.  Well, that's the law giving teeth, right there.  When they come back to the law after merely 2 years of no pay I'm sure alllllllll of the govenrnment contract for them for their demonstrated willingness to take advantage of vulnerable people.  The teeth of the law in NZ have asserted themselves.  Everything that is motivational and aspirational about a career in law, right there.  So you know why you might want to invest in a Law career in NZL.  Have tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars billed to the IRD against your name.  However many tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars to various universities in studnet fees etc etc.</p>

                                <p>We are going to need a call out.  A shout out.  For all the people who have been struck off the register for Medical Doctors, for Teachers...  All of the people who have been struck off from practicing in the USA or the Uk or anywhere at all. All of the criminal violent offenders.  They aren't going to have a trial for you to answer to (corrupt) judges or jury.  They will simply ship you off to NZL with the intention that you committ violent crimes against the people who did not choose to be born in NZL.  So that we can all come to terms with how it would be better if you were to hire people to do the knock out gene studies and simply externminate them before birth.  There's nothing there.  The elite in-breds of the UK and the USA deemed it to be so.  A a a a a a a all the e e e e e e elite i i i i i in breds of P p p p princeton wehre the oo o o oo oo only game in town.  Nodbody fron NZL could have paid employment while you signed them off to the slaughter.  No skilled trained workers in NZL.  Have to redeploy them from overseas.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>   https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/486903/suggestions-of-delay-in-redress-an-insult-say-survivors-of-abuse-in-state-care  I wrote a 1 year MPhil for the University of Waikato in 2018 which was supposed to be enough for the University of Auckland to consider an application from me to Medicine on the basis of it's academic merits.  They sill will not do it.  They won't do it.  Nobdody who has been a victim of abuse in state care is allowed to be part of reforming the system for the better.  There's nothing here.  They throw out applications from domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years so they can employ their best esimate who is going to be the next Dr leeks.  There is nothing here.  Nobody here.  No f*cking hint of 'try'. </p>

                                <p>The Education and Training Act says that Domestic Adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible to be enrolled in the programme that they have applied to.  The point or purpose of this section of the act was to provide protection in law to Domestic Adults.  The idea being that without protection in law for domestic adults the Universities would choose to fill up the available training places with foreigners and teenagers.  Why?   Because it is easier to exploit foreigners.  You can simply deport them when you are done with them.  You can say that they no speak English and that is why you refuse to graduate them etc.  Why they need to pay you more and more money for University employees to edit their work or check their work for errors.  Pay $5,000 to university support services, was it?  For Professional Editing of your thesis?  Part of how the University administration decides whether you have 'done enough' for them to think about giving you your 1 year qualification...  3 years later...  Also it is easier to exploit teenagers.  They are only recently removed from their parents so tend to be more compliant.  Used to being required to do what their parents say else basic needs like food and shelter can be withdrawn.  So the statute seems to have been constructed with the intention of protecting a special class of persons - namely domestic adults.  In the face of the Universities refusing to enrol domestic adults, claiming the training places are full of international students and teenagers.  Ideally international teenagers.  Ones who are entitled to a free secondary school education they are recording levels of debt against their name to enrol them in teh university (thereby depriving them of their free secondary education) and they aren't even teaching them at the level of the standard secondary curriculum.  I mean to say that Universities have become stupid-land of stupids.  People who don't even have secondary school levels of readaing writing or arithmetic.  The University was a 'take out' special class for people to be kept (unlawfully) detained.  Renenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled.  Put to work as researchers.  Handing over the research output of the unviersity.  The only research output that there is.  While the University actually refuses to train them.  Refuses to pay people to teach meaningful content.  The studens are enrolled in courses they don't want to do.  PRogrammes they never would have applied to.  They are refused enrolment in courses they would want to do.  Like Medicine.  A lot of people want to do that, apparently.  So that means that a lot of people are 'diverted' into degrees they actually don't want to do.  Like Public Health.  So they can learn about how people need to be frequently reminded about free smoking the freely smoking campaigning green would be a nice color for the freely smoking smoke freely campaign.  Employing Ashley Bloomfield (no research output) to be professor of the qualification that nobody wanted to do.  They only were enrolled in it because they wanted to study medicine.  But there is no medical training progarmme, at all.  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>In the High Court proceeding of Roe v University of Waikato Justice Toogood found that he did not see any problem with the University of Waikato recording me as being enrolled in programmes of study that I never applied to be enrolled in.  He also wrote a report to the government where he didn't see anything wrong with the University of Canterbury having Mason Pendrous enrolled in the University when he had literally died.  I mean to say, the Universities have bene given lisence to completely fabricate their enrolment records by the High Court.  Which is of course an utter absurdity.  They are not keeping accurate enrolment records at all, in fact, however.  If you look at the applications to enrol and you look at the enrolment records you will see that they are enrolling studnets in programmes the students never applied to.  So the IRD has false information regarding levels of studnet debt as well.  Because they are saying the 'students' owe the government for education and training programmes that the studnet never even applied to be enrolled in, you see.  And they don't even give the studnet the qualification.  It's just a scummy scam.  THey are keeping false enrolment records.</p>

                                <p>  https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/131611350/student-sues-polytech-for-10m-over-vaccine-mandate  And we already know what will happen here.  The High Court will provide teeth to the Polytech being able to do anything it likes and be sure to financially and psychologically punish the studnet for not being willing to keep his mouth shut, for not complying with an (unlawful) order or mandate, for complaining about the situation.  Thereby ensuring the imbalance of power is maintained.  See..  The studnet does not understand their position.  The polytech was never actually going to graduate him from the qualification, anway, and was never ever ever ever ever going to pay him skilled wages to work the job for which he had trained.  I mean, think about it, for 5 minutes.  Lord God Ashley Bloomfield is 'Dr' in virtue of MBChB. But they won't actually register him to see patients or pay him to do the job for which he trained.  Ayesha Verrell is also a MBChB.  So, of course, they will never pay her to see patients.  Shane Reti is the exception who is paid to 'see patients' (likely to tell Maaori Chiefs that they have the very very very very very very best of the Healthcare that Harvard has to offer all of the expediated wait-times on the voluntary taxpayers elective 'surgeries' and the like) for only 1 to 3 weeks of every year.  We don't have an education and training system.  I mean...  You wouldn't have thought that the Judges were actually law graduates who write their own judgments for which they are paid.  Why would they have their qualifications (completed more than 5 years ago) acknowledged?  That does not seem to occur in any other sector.</p>

                                <p>NZ and Australaian Universities are not functioning as Universities.  Look at the enrolment records to see for what length of time they are keeping studnets enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled in their qualifications.  Particularly their graduate research qualifications.  They refuse to get students work out for external examination.  They are keeping prisoners hostages or slaves.  They are not functioning as Universities at all.  I think it likely they are saying that they have two or even three or possibly even more times the amount of graduate research studnets than they have in fact because of the  number of studnets they are double and triple billing for.  So that they can keep a lot of people on university payroll who don't actually output any research at all. Sometimes they are re-atributing the students work to other people who are on payroll so it looks like other people have a research output when they are plagrarising.  Othertimes they don't seem to care that they have a lot of hires who either aren't being acknowledged as having any research output else do not in fact have any research output at all.  They pretend that it is 'soooo competitive' and more people wnat to do it than there are places available.  But they do this even when they only have one applicant for a programme of study.  I mean to say it is just bullying and abusive is all it is.  They intentionally want studnets to believe that it's competitive and so on so that they will feel forced to do anything anything anything the supervisors or university administration says.  Housesit for them.  Go camping.  Entertain them at morning and afternoon tea.  Dinner and drinks.  While they refuse to do their jobs and help the student finish their work of high quality in a timely fashion.  While they refuse to get the work out to external examiners in a timely fashion in order to say they have more students than they do in fact.  They are keeping hostages or slaves.  Corruption.  What are you going to do about it?  You and whose army?  The government keeps giving them money to keep slaves and pay lawyers (or slaves) to do legal filings asserting they can do anything anyting they want.  Re-appointing judges out of retirement to refuse to accept TEC defining 120 points as 1 EFT as 34 weeks work including the external examination period.  They are not keeping accurate enrolment records.  THey are keeping false transcripts.  They are not functioning as Universities at all.</p>

                                <p>They intentionally hire people at the University to bully the students.  I mean to say they intentionally hire all these 'university support' staff or personel where their whole entire goal aim purpose or point is to undermine and stabotage the student meat producing animals.  Telling them they can't spell.  Rearranging the rearrangement of the research into word salad and so on.  So they get more and more and more and more money to have a fancy job at the University.  What University?  Where is all the research output?  Where do all the academic scholarships go?  The ones that were supposed to provide financial assistance to the student meat animals so that it could afford to live someplace where it could have it's basic needs met so it could go on producing?  The money isn't going to the students.  So they can bully the studnets into cry cry crying for extension after extension.  So that various people on payroll can go on fancy conference trips and so on when they don't even have any research to present.  It's a f*cking farce of a joke of a scummy scam.  Where is the research output?  I have transcripts supplied by the Univesrity of Waikato for a thesis I wrote.  It seems to have been removed from the Univesrity.  They aren't even trying to have a research output at all.  To say nothing of undermining teaching and nursing and law and everything.  So that stupid bullies can be employed to bully.  Not even trying to be universities at all.  There's nothing there.  Enrol only the people with no reading writing or arithmetic and give them A's for re-typing your powerpoints notes you gave them.  THen keep them re-enrolled forever you f*cking stupid bullying retards.  That is what their aim their point their purpose their goal is.  What university?  What a f*cking joke.</p>

                            <p>How long are you supposed to work full time on a 120 point research project before it goes out for external examination?  How about a 360 point one?  For it to be sent out with instructions for external examiners to examine it with respect to acceptability for the programme the student applied to be working on, and the one they had been working on, I mean to say.  How many decades are you supposed to hand over research to NZ Universities so they can re-atribute authorship to someone else or give your research away or attempt to bury it if they do not like what you have to say? </p> 

                            <p>MA.  The University of Waikato kept me enrolled for 2 academic years and 1 summer school period.  It was a 120 point 1 year research qualification only.  </p>

                            <p>PhD.  The Australian National University had me as a summer scholar.  They accepted my work well enough for them to give me a Government Scholarship to do a PhD.  They never got my work out to externals so that it could be externally examined.     </p>

                            <p>MPhil.  I only enrolled in this because the University of Auckland said that completing it would be enough for them to consider an MBChB application from me and process it on the basis of it's academic merits.  They said I needed to complete a new qualification since my MA was completed more than 5 years ago and the ANU never got my research out for external examination and Auckland said they wouldn't acknowledge Australian Qualification anyway.  So I applied to enrol in a 120 point MPhil with the intention of completing the 120 point programme of study in 1 academic year on a full time basis.  Waikato refused to get the work out for external examination.  Instructing me to keep working in excess of requirements for the Degree.  Then they instructed external examiners to examine it for the wrong qualification (PhD rather than MPhil where a PhD is three years of study and about twice the length).  Then they re-enrolled me in the MPhil for more than 120 points -- even though I never applied to re-enrol in any programme of study.  Then they refused to get more work I had done out for externals.  Then, when the overseas external said he wanted an oral defence they recorded that they failed me for the qualification.
                            </p>

                            <p>So, I have more than 100,000 of student loan for qualifications that NZ Universities refuse to acknowledge.  NZ and Australian Universities won't get my research work out to be externally examined (for the qualification I was enrolled in).  Not because they think externals will fail me.  But because they think they will pass me.  But there cannot be a job for me, apparently.  There will be a job for me only over their dead bodies.  Because they are the  only game in town and it's soooooo competitive.  </p>

                            <p>Auckland University and Otago University are not properly processing applications to MBChB (Medicine).  They are throwing away applications when they think that the applications will appear favorable compared to other applicants.  They are throwing away applications before they go before the Medical Admissions COmmittee so that their preferred candidates (e.g., their dependents) can be the only game in town.  They are not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                            <p>NZ Universites are not functioning as Universities.  They have various people on payroll who do no research.  They refuse to allow their students to have their research go out to externals and refuse to credit them as having completed the Degrees.  That way they are forced to stay in NZ, I guess.  Can't apply for jobs.  Can't apply for research funding.  WOuld only have the applications thrown away, anyway.  Can't leave the country because they don't have any qualifications acknowledged.  MOre than 100,000 debt recorded against my name.  Full time GPA of 8.6.  But no job for me.  Only a job for me over their dead bodies, apparently.  Won't even re-train me then in Medicine.  Since apparently the problem is that we have more Philosophy Graduates than jobs.  Which is why we have to hire USA Graduates and Australian Graduates.  British Graduates.  Foreign Nationals.  So that NZers can be kept unemployed.  Preferntially hiring foreigners.  Even when teh NZers do have Degrees.  But they pretty much stopped graduating NZers.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>I guess a few do have jobs overseas.  NZ PhD grads, I mean.  Actually no.  I don't think that is true.  NZers who were acknowledged as having graduated from Australian Universities.  Did their work go out for external examination?  I don't actually think that it did.  I think they just choose to tell some people that they have done enough.  After they have  been tapped on the shoulder for a job offer.  Told to get their CV in as a mere formality.  So they can participate in the scummy scam of refusing to get their students work out for external examination.  Taking the work of some and reattributing authorship to others.  Giving the students work away.  Supressing that which they do not like.  Chocolate coating it and handing it to others.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  Apparently it's soooooo competitive.  But there is actually nothing there. </p>

                            <p>People don't enrol in Uni because they want to learn.  Ashley Bloomfield just got made Professor ffs.  He never worked on a PhD or an MD.  He doesn't have any research output.  Why doesn't he practice Medicine with his NZ Medical Degree? Oh.  THey won't register him so he actually see patients.  Shane Reti sees his patients for 1 or is it 3 weeks of every year only.  Not even trying to have a health system.  Justice Toogood doesn't see any probelm with NZ Universities recording enrolment in progarmmes of study (enrolment periods) that the studnet never applied to.  Well, then, sign them all up for their indefinate detention in public health.  They can be detained indefinately under the 'zero fees scheme' and their work can never be externally examined on it's academic merits at all.  There can be no reading list.  Just repeat back to Ashley what you read on the powerpoint presentation that he stole from someone else for you to memorise.  Not even trying to be fair.  What education and training system?  Reappointing judges out of retirement.  Refusing to appoint new judges.  Guess they don't have any law grards.  The Degrees are more than 5 years old so no longer acknowledged.  Except for Ashley and the like being re-deployed into positions they aren't even qualified for.  Telling the grads of Harvard to come eto NZ to do their knock out baby gene studies trying to breed a happy slave underclass.  Giving employment to foreigners so that they can keep NZers unemployed.  So they can give Ashley hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to do a job where he  makes decisions that are 'technically unlawful'.  Where the courts provide teeth that the government employees can do anything anything anything they like (even break the law) with the blessing of the legal system.  What judiciary?  What health system?  What education system?  Prison slave detention camp.  The only leaders for NZ that international community will acknoweldge are ones who apparently use their soverigny to choose to contribute towards NZ's being so.  Not because it is a penal colony of the Northern Hemisphere because it is under British Control.  But because the leaders voluntarily choose to soverignly rule it so.  Of course.  Sure.  No problems.  Don't see any problems.  No problems to see.  Supression and repression and no problems at all.  We don't know how lucky we are.</p>
