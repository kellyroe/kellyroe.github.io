                                <p>____Corruption at the Australian National University___
                                </p>

                                <p>I wrote to the Vice Chancellor of the University to express my concern that the Australian National University is acting in bad faith.  They had me there as a Summer Research Scholar so they could see how I worked over the summer.  They refused to write me a reference in support of PhD applications.  They accepted an application to study PhD with them.  They then provided no supervision to me.  I have documented evidence of more than 8 written talks that I gave at conferences and the like and there will be little to no evidence of supervisory input in any of that.  I have a more than 100,000 word thesis document that went to my supervisor and there will be little to no evidence of supervisory input in any of that.  They did not get my work to externals.  In 2021 I wrote to my supervisor and notified him that I intended to apply again.  I would rather have credit for the work that I had done, already, rather than starting over on a new project.  But I also supplied a research proposal to him.  He refused to write me a reference in support of my application.  He refused to be a referee.  The University contacted me to say that he was refusing to be a referee so I needed to name someone else.  They did not notify me at that time that my application was incomplete.  They then declined it saying that I had not provided to them a writing sample or a research proposal.  They also stated that they do not have any willingness or ability to supervise research in the Philsophy Programme.
                                </p>

                                <p>Since they are a research university (without a graduate level teaching curriculum) it is concerning, I would have thought, that none of the people presently employed to do philosophy are willing or able to supervise research in any philsophy topic (they declared them unwilling or unable to supervise across the entire breadth of the field of philosophy).  I wrote to the Vice Chancellor to say that the University was acting in very bad faith, indeed.  I provided evidence that I had supplied a link to the writing page (containing numerous writing samples) and the ANU already had 3 writing samples on file from me for my previous applications.  The Vice Chancellor instructed me to write a new complaint to one of the Deans.  She then instructed me to write a new complaint to another of the Deans.  He then tried to inform me that he was refusing to acknowledge that he had received a formal complaint and he would not be progressing or processing it.  Rather, I needed to try again to revise and resubmit my complaint into something they may choose to acknowledge.
                                </p>

                                <p>They have had every opportunity to sort things out amicably, in house.  They refuse to do that so I inform the public so that the people may know that the Australian National University is a corrupt institution that is not being fair in how it handles applications to enroll, progressions though qualifications, and it is not being fair on choosing to bankroll various people who, according to the University, are some combination of unwilling and or unable to do the job for which they are paid (supervise students in the subject they are employed to supervise students in).  
                                </p>

                                <p>___Corruption in New Zealand Universities___
                                </p>

                                <p>These webpages document how various of the New Zealand Universities are similarly unwilling and or unable to perform their statutory functions.  The University of Otago is unwilling or unable to supply application forms to domestic adults (who are eligible to be enrolled in the programme of their choosing by statute).  The University of Auckland is throwing applications away because they say the candidate is 'ineligible' when the Education Act states that domestic adults are eligible, by Statute.  They are not following their own published algorithm for how they are supposed to select candidates when there are more eligible applicants than available places.  They choose to use their discretion to enrol teenagers, particularly, who are taught that it is sooooo competitive they must  be willing to do anything anything anything anything anything.  The University of Waikato is enrolling (and invoicing the Government for enrolments in) programmes of study that the studnet never even applied to.  They are refusing to get theses that have  been submitted for examination out to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit timely completion so that they force reenrolment and reenrolment and reerolment in the qualification (as the Australian National Univesrity was doing with me in their PhD Programme).  I have supplied evidence of the New Zealand Universities (the branding on the New Zealand Vice Chancellor's Committee) refusing to acknowledge receipt of complaints.  They simply refuse to acknoweldge that they have received complaints and they refuse (therefore) to provide any whistleblower protections to anybody who has attempted (by their reckoning unsuccessfully) to notify the NZVCC of issues of corruption within various of the New Zealand Universities.
                                </p>

                                <p>I exhausted internal complaints resolution in each of the above cases and they chose to use their internal process to close ranks about themselves and gaslight me into believing that I had not lodged a complaint etc.  I initiated Judicial Review of Administrative Action against multiple parties (you can follow on the Judicial Review page) and the Judiciary chose to pull judges out of retirement (not proper process for appointing them) in order to try and make the cases go away.  You can see how the Supreme Court of New Zealand has ruled that none of the above are matters of public interest.  They have ordered tens of thousands of dollars of costs against me for having brought these issues before the courts.  The Judges have refused to accept evidence I have brought before them, the Judges have refused to acknowledge the half of the Education Act that confers responsibilities and duties upon the Universities and Vice Chancellor's Committee, the Judges have refused to provide teeth or consequences for the University of Auckland having acted Ultra Vires in throwing away my application to enrol in MBChB in 2018 and again in 2019 because they deemed me 'ineligible' when they did not have the power or authority to deem me, a domestic adult, to be ineligible to have applied.  They were therefore required to apply their selection algorithm to my application (enter my GPA, UMAT / UCAT score, interview score) into their rank order listing and offer me a place (or not) according to my rank order score.  The University simply refuses to do that.  They assert that they did that and my GPA was too low.  They then document how they did not follow their selection algorithm when they calculated my GPA.  They refuse, then, to enter it correctly on grounds that they don't have to because they say I am 'ineligible' but they don't have the discretion or authority to deem domestic adults ineligible for programmes they have applied to.  Apparently it is not a matter of public interest how the Universities of New Zealand go about selecting the next Dr Leeks.  Or the next Doctor who killed Amber Herd.  Or the next Doctor who writes a pathology report on the cause of death of Olivia.  Apparently none of this is in the public interest, at all.  They should be free to select teenagers who they train to do anything anything anything anything to have a place and to be progressed through their training and to be signed off from training and to be in the hospitals doing anything anything anything without supervision.  While...  Well, who exactly is on payroll to be consultant (not student) in our hospitals?  Apparently that is not information that the District Health Boards can supply under OIA because they just record in their accounts that billions go to 'external consultants'.  The level of corruption.
                                </p>


                                <p>Most of the rest of this is me saying the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.  Because they just won't listen or progress the things.  Australasia shouldn't be allowed to take foreign students because it is too corrupt, in these parts.  They don't appear to have the intention to act with honesty and integrity at all when it comes to their dealings or interactions.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                </p>

                                <p>Here is a  <a href="seminar/sterelny.pdf" target="_self"> research proposal (PDF) </a> that I supplied to Kim Sterelny on 30 October 2021.  You can see that he advised me that my having written a research proposal was 'premature'.  My application to the ANU was then declined and they say it was declined because he refused to act as a referee and they refuse to acknowledge that I had written a research proposal.  They also asserted that they declined it becuase I had not supplied a writing sample when they had 3 from me already on file from past applications and when I supplied a link to the writing page of this website that has many writing samples including numerous masters and PhD length theses and a published book chapter with OUP.  <a href="seminar/vc.pdf" target="_self"> Here is my initial complaint to the Vice Chancellor (PDF) </a>  They could have chosen to work with me in house to figure out what to do about my thesis submission that I supplied to my supervisor who is still bankrolled by the Australian National University (apparently) when he is still refusing to supervise or, failing that, he is refusing to just get the work to the external examiners, then, and allow him to do the job that he refuses to do, of saying what concrete changes need to happen over the next 6 months, say, before the student gets signed off as having completed the requirements of the PhD.  I mean, how many years of labor could it possibly take?  I mean, who the hell signed him off?? <a href="seminar/anudean.pdf" target="_self"> Here is the Australian National University simply refusing to accept my complaint</a>.  They instruct me to revise and resubmit my complaint.  They have had every opportunity to sort things out in house and they refuse.  I now post this publically so that the public can see the evidence for themselves and make up their own mind about the quality and integrity of the Australian National Univesrity (Australasias premiere research institution that apparently or allegedly according to them does not have the willingness and / or ability to supervise graduate research students) or to get graduate research studnets work out to external examiners for external examination if the people on payroll to supervise graduate research students are too stupid or too lazy or too psychopathic to do their job.  The job for which they are paid.
                                </p>


                                <p>I have documented on the writing page academic research work that I have done while enrolled at the University of Waikato and the Australian National University.  They refuse to acknowledge much of the work that I have done.  THey refuse to provide supervision to their research students.  The University gets money from the government for keeping the student enrolled and the University refuses to employ people willing and or able to supervise research.  Where is the evidence of supervision of my research?  Where is the evidnece of supervision meetings?  Where is the evidence of concrete comments on my work?  Where is the evidence of the supervisor telling me of things like what I needed to get to them by what date in order for them to do these things?  I supplied my supervisor with research and they don't comment on it until they start throwing screaming tantrum of hissy fits that the work is not going out to externals.  They will just keep writing that I should have more and more and more and more reenrollment and reenrollment and reenrollment and reenrollment so they can collect up more and more and more and more and more money for keeping me enrolled while they refuse to acknowledge my work. 
                                </p>

                                <p>I guess I was supposed to follow them around and beg them or bribe them?  How is it supposed to go, exactly?  THey are on payroll to supervise me.  
                                </p>

                                <p>The Australian National University got a writing sample from me that was supposedly good enough for them to have me as a summer research scholar.  Professor Martin Davies refused to write me a reference towards any PhD applications but he said he would support my going back to the ANU to do a PhD there.  I gave the ANU two additional writing samples and they enrolled me in their PhD programme.  On the seminars page you can see evidence of my progressing in my academic work over 2006 and 2007.  There are powerpoint presentations and there are also, in some instances, the written talk that the powerpoint and seminar was based on.  The write-up of the talk, I mean to say.  That I presented at various conferences.  Where is the evidence of my supervisor having provided any supervisory input at all on the production of any of that research?  Where is the evidence of my supervisor having directed my readings, instructing any writings, having commented on any of the work?  Where is the evidence of supervision?  What the hell do they pay him for?
                                </p>

                                <p>My file notes record him saying that the ANU should get more and more and more and more and more money from the Australian Government to keep me enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled in the programme.  My file notes record him (and other academics in the department) saying that I nearly had a full draft and (at one point) they expected me to complete in a few months (on time).  Where is the evidence that they passed on this expectation and deadline to me so that I could ensure that I worked to it?  Where is the evidence of them doing any of the things that they were supposed to do in training me at all?
                                </p>

                                <p>Instead of doing his job training me Kim Sterelny wrote a slavery manifesto 'The Evolved Apprentice' where he writes about all the things that go into training while simultaneously refusing to supply any of those things to me.  He asked me to housesit for him several times, thought, and go away on various camping trips under the rubric of conference while refusing to do his job supervising me.  Still, the least he can do, then, is get out of the f*cking way -- right?  If he isn't going to do his job, then get out of the f*cking way. Get the work to the external examiners, then.  So the external examiners can examine the work on it's academic merits.  That is or means to say, that a person who doesn't know anything about me (doesn't know my age or my gender or how many years I've been working or who my daddy is etc etc) can examine my work on it's academic merits.  Can provide comments on things to be changed if things need to be changed.  Do the f*cking work that my supervisor refused to do, in other words.
                                </p>

                                <p>But he wouldn't even do that.
                                </p>

                                <p>Why the hell would I want to do Philosophy when it's  been overwridden by the psychopaths that he loves to write about?  There isn't any philosophy because it's been overtaken by psychopaths.  Instead of doing philosophy we get to housesit and socialise at lunch and dinner and drinks and go away diving on conferences and have conferences at fancy hotels.  Instead of doing the academic work and doing the work supervising the studnets various people are paid vast amounts of research funding to keep students enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and it's so fun to party party party party party what philosophy?  Nothing to see, people.  Nothing to see.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  Nothing at all.
                                </p>

                                <p>New Zealand constantly cry cry cry cry cry cry cry 'we don't have skilled workers'.  New Zealand won't pay anybody to train the next generation of workers.  New Zealand wont' pay anybody to get out of the f*cking way of the next generation of workers, either.  Get out of the f*cking way then, Sterelny.  Retire already.  F*cking die for all I care. What would you care if I died?  Not one jot.  Not one iota.  Why the hell would I care about you, then?  You can't even do your f*cking job.  The f*cking job for which you are paid.  Where is the evidence of your supervising me?  Where is the evidence of supervision?  If you can't do it then where is the evidence of you documenting how you are unwilling and or unable to do the job for which you are paid and recuse yourself from your position, then? Where is the evidence of your getting my work that I got you out to external examiners?  Get out of the f*cking way.
                                </p>

                                <p>New Zealand cry cry cry cry cry cry cry 'we don't have enough doctors.  We don't need more philosophy academics.  All of our Philosophy PhD graduates don't have jobs in New Zealand.  We will preferentially hire graduates of overseas Universities over New Zealanders.  We will not acknowledge our own PhD graduates.  But we have progressed and developed in our race to the bottom.  We won't get our students work out to external examiners so that they can't possibly sign off on our studnets having completed their research work now, either!  The lengths we will go to because we like to cry cry cry cry cry that we don't have any skilled workers'.
                                </p>

                                <p>The Statutory Law of New Zealand (Education and Training Act) states that domestic adults are eligible to be enrolled in programmes they have applied to.  The Universities have discretion to decide whether or not they believe teenagers can complete the programme and discretino to decide whether particular teenagers can complete the programme and discretion to enrol only the teenagers who they believe are able to complete the programme.  But they have no discretion at all to discuss amongst themselves and decide whether or not domestic adults are eligible.  They are required to regard domestic adults (who have attained the age of 20 years) to be eligible.  
                                </p>

                                <p>Despite this, the Universities of Auckland and Otago have seen fit to (1) say that in order for me to be eligible I was required to enroll in further study with a NZ University first (because they asserted they have the ability to disregard study completed more than 5 years ago).  (2) remove my application in early processing stages to prevent the application going before the selection committee with all the other applications.  (3) refuse to supply me with application to enrol.  In other words, the Universities of New Zealand think that they have unlimited power to pick and choose who they enrol in what programme.  They have used this unlimited power that they believe they have to fill up certain programmes (particularly Medicine and Law) with teenagers.  So they can have things like Law camp and take them camping.  Ski trips.  Then they belive they have discretion to say that they all failed to meet the requirements of the qualification (because we are keeping indentured servant or slave camps only) and therefore we refuse to graduate them.  I mean, you can hire yourself a gown and take photos.  You can photoshop in an approximation of a VC.  You can print yourself off whatever you like and hang it on the wall.  The transcripts aren't worth the paper they aren't even printed on, these days, and New Zealand (and by the seems of it Australian) Universities are not really functioning as Universities, at all.  I don't know what you need to do in order to get certain degrees?  They don't seem to be graduating.  I suppose it is so that they can get immigrants in working certain 'jobs' until they realise they aren't on payroll for working those jobs.  If they don't pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the University for re-enrolling (qualifications not acknowledged, anymore, visa taken back, go directly to prison or get out of our country).
                                </p>

                                <p>Dishonest people live here.  You cannot do business with New Zealand.
                                </p>

                                <p>The judiciary has, thus far, refused to uphold justice.  Justice Fitzgerald found (in Roe v University of Auckland) that the University did not in fact have the authority to decide eligibility criterion for domestic adults.  But she refused to supply teeth or consequences for them having misadvised me that I needed to do various other things (at considerable cost to myself) in order to get eligibilty.  She said that it did not matter whether I was eligible or not because they had authority to set selection criterion.  But in response to this the selection criterion that they set involved GPA, UMAT/UCAT, and interview score jointing determining a rank order score where places were to be offered to candidates on the  basis of their rank order scoring (with discretion to promote lower scored individuals on the basis of equity consideration for Maaori, Pacifica, disability, refugee only).  All I asked Auckland to do was enter my GPA, UMAT/UCAT, and interview score into their rank order scoring and offer me a place (or not) on the basis of my scoring.  I was not asking them to give me disability equity consideration.  I was asking them to progress the application according to their standard algorithm for selection.  In response to this the University had told me that they had done that and my rank order score was not high enough for a place.  I said I did not believe them.  They informed me of how they calculated my GPA.  They did not calculate it in accordance with their algorithm.  They took my WORST (rather than best) 120 points (by disregarding a summer school paper above stage 1) and they used a year in which I did not even complete 120 points instead of my last full time year (where my GPA was higher in years where I had higher workload).  The University said that it did not matter that they had miscalculated my GPA because I was not eligible.  But they don't get to decide eligibility.  The courts found that they do have discretion to set selection criterion when they get more applications than there are places.  But the courts failed to find that if they have set selection criterion that are in fact lawful, then they are required to actually use that selection criterion in order to select candidates.

                                <p>The evidnece is that the University of Auckland is corrupt as to how they are selecting studnets to enrol in MBChB.  They have had every opportunity to put right any honest errors on their part that they may have made in processing my application.  2 Deans and the Vice Chancellor were made aware of how they miscalculated my GPA and refused to offer me enrolment (or not) on the basis of my rank order score, for the reason that they said they did not have to do this because they believed they had discretion to regard any candidate who had not completed a qualification from a NZ university within the last 5 years to be 'ineligible'.  In conjunction with this information ask yourself -- who did get sent offers of enrolment in MBChB?  The answer to that is teenagers who were being selected at the end of their first year of university study around the same time as when the university was deciding on what grades they were going to give those same studnets for their first year study with that university.  They were fixing both their grades and whether or not they were being offered enrolment in MbChB at the same time, in other words.  The decisions were not made on the basis of GPA, the GPA decisions were made on the basis of who was going to be enrolled in MBChB.  The other main source of enrolments was students who were presently enrolled in a New Zealand University in their third year of a three year undergraduate Degree.  The grades those students were going to be given for their third year of study were being decided by their New Zealand Universities at around the same time as the University of Auckland was deciding who to enrol in MBChB.  That is or means to say the vast majority of the students who were offered enrolment in MBChB were not graduates of a New Zealand University, at all.  Students who were offered enrolment on the basis of their Honors Year were in similar position of their last year of full time study grades being decided at the same time as offers of enrolment in MBChB.  I mean to say the Universities are fairly obviously and clearly fixing (as in making up or doctoring) the grades.  New Zealand's shortage of doctors is doctored, in fact.  New Zealand refuses to enrol, progress, sign off on completion of training.  New Zealand also refuses to publically advertise positions, refuses to progress the applications for positions that have been advertised, refuses to pay the workers.  There's really nothing here.  Just a scummy scummy scam.                                </p>

                                <p>The University of Otago is not processing applications to enrol in MBChB properly.  They believe they have discretion to throw away applications from domestic adults in order to prioritise selection of teenagers.  They then arrange for teenagers to have internships where they are not allowed to go to the hospital and do the internship, or they refuse to acknowledge that they have been signed off as having completed it if it has been signed off.  They are refusing to graduate people who have met the requirements of the qualifications insofar as the requirements of the qualifications are actually possible to meet.  I mean to say, they make the requirements impossible for anybody to meet and they just hand out the acknowledgements to a  bunch of phoney frauds.  I guess that is the idea.  Having a PhD or a MBChB makes you a 'most desirable' person since they can throw you in prison or rescind your visa or whatever at any point in time (at the point in time when it is time for them to pay you, strangely enough, nobody would have seen that coming).

                                <p>Cry cry cry cry cry for skilled workers from overseas so that we can have them here, pretending to be working, until it's time for us to pay them and then it's time for them to go away.  There's nothing here.  No education and training system at all.  Thus far the courts of New Zealand have refused to uphold justice.  I suppose that is because the 'lawyers' needed to graduate from Law Degrees and why would we think that Law Degrees have any more quality and integrity than philosophy degrees have any more quality and integrity than medical degrees.  There's actually nothing to see, people.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  What a hokey scummy scam.  Don't get sick, y'all.  It's sooooooooo competitive.  How many people can you kill today?  That's the idea/l -- right?  What you have to do to get a reference, these days.  Oh, my.

                            <p>The Tertiary Education Commission defines a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  
                            <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a>.  The Universities and the Courts will not accept this, however.  They will not allow people to complete their work in a timely fashion.  They force extensions.  Sometimes studnets are outright bullied into not handing their work in.  Sometimes they pretend they never received work that was in fact handed in.  If you keep records of the fact that you handed the work in before the deadline then the University and the Courts both still deny it.  They will not allow people to complete their work in a timely fashion.  Because it is not an education system.  It is an unlawful slave or detention camp for endentured servants.

                            <p>The Judiciary is now imploding.  Making it obvious or apparent to everyone that there isn't a functioning Judiciary, etiher.  Read the Judgements of the Supreme Court.  Were you floored by the Judicial Reasoning as I was?  Were you motivated and inspired to learn from the Supreme Court of New Zealand what Justice looks like?  The embodiment of Justice, right there.  It is not a matter of public interest that New Zealand Universities are not processing applications to enrol, progressions through training, and qualification completions fairly (on the basis of the academic merits).  It is not a matter of public interest, apparently.  I exhausted a 3 stage internal complaints resolution with the Universities. I took it to the Ombudsman and I took it to the VC of the New Zealand Tertiary Education Commission (who likes to market at Universities New Zealand who likes to have a con-munications page 'n' iconography kinda like 'Nature') who has the statutory responsibility to uphold the quality and integrity of New Zealand University Qualifications.  And when these individuals chose to use their position to produce garbage output on how they can't see anything wrong with the Universities refusing to follow the law and also refusing to follow their own regulations the Supreme Court of New Zealand thinks that that is fine and in fact I should pay a bunch of court costs to the New Zealand Courts for the crimes (effectively) of the Universities of New Zealand.

Our highest court does not seem to have the conception of justice, at all.  It was the courts decision to delay Roe v University of Waikato proceedings until AFTER Roe v NZVCC and also until AFTER Roe v University of Auckland.  The Judge for Roe v NZVCC made all kinds of pronouncement in his judgment on the matter of Roe v University of Waikato.  That is to say instead of judging the issue he was supposed to be judging (the inaction of Chris Whelan in his capacity as CE of the NZVCC) he thought he would weigh in on whether or not I had done enough for completion of the MPhil Degree.  Clearly that is a matter of the Judge of a different case to decide!

They say that they don't have to honor the constitution because New Zealand officials did not turn up to various things and they did not consent.  I don't know why Australia would care about consent in that instance.  Did they care about the consent of the Aboriginal people of Australia?  Did they care about consent of people to be immunised or subject to medical treatments or experimentation?  If they want to change the constitution then there is a process for it to be changed.  I think it involves a vote.  But New Zealanders don't get to vote so the Australian Government clearly does not care whether or not the people of New Zealand consent.  New Zealand functions as a detention camp of Australia.  But then, Australia still seems to govern like it is a detention camp of the Northern Hemisphere, so...

                            <p>Una Jagose doesn't seem to have the job of instructing Crown Law to prosecute corruption within New Zealand Universities, or within the Judiciary (where judges refuse to accept evidence and where the supreme court punishes people for bringing injustices before the courts).  I suppose that is why they pay her more than half a million dollars to do that job.  They pay her to ensure the job is not done by anyone.  Not by her and not by anybody else.  The fact she is in the job prevents and prohibits the job being filled  by anyone with the willingness and ability to do the job.  It seems there is no evidence that they will accept that would attest to corruption.  None of the invoicing information that I provided (e.g., 0.5 EFTS = 120 points = 60 points = indefinate enrolment).  New Zealand does not appear to have a functioning judiciary.    <p> <a href="judicial-review/crown-law.pdf" target="_self"> Blow off response. </a>

It all starts to sound confusing, doesn't it.  The gaslighting garbage output nonsense nonsene nonsense from the courts.  Denying the evidence.

    <p>Evidence of corruption.  <a href="writing/lawsociety.pdf" target="_self">Letter from the Law Society (PDF)</a></p>

    <p> Here we have a letter from the Law Society that declares that Philip Cornege is conflicted out of representing a party when his wife (K Cornege) has been employed by opposing counsel. 

     <a href="writing/conflict.eml" target="_self">Here is a letter from me to the Court of Appeal informing them of Phillip and K Cornege being being employed by opposing counsel in certain matters of corruption to be heard in the Court of Appeal (.eml). </a>  (The file format is .eml which means it will use your browser or your email programme to open the text file).  I notified Una Jagose of the conflict on April 25 2021 at 7:24pm by email.  K Cornege responded to me as follows:  'Phillip does not act for the Commissioner of Police, but for MAP and Associates Trustee Company Limited.  There is no conflict between our respective clients, whose interests are aligned for the purposes of the High Court proceeding and appeal.  I recognise that the Court of Appeal list is somewhat confusing as to who acts for whom.' Yes.  I am confused.  K Cornege and P Cornege are on different sides of the 'v' which means they are acting on opposing sides with respect to these proceedings.  Me soooooooooooo confuuuuuuused.  Yeeeeeeees.  That must  be the problem. The response I received from the Court of Appeal was to say 'as you are not a party to this proceeding we are unable to discuss matters of party representation with you. No correspondence will be entered in to regarding it.'  That is how the Court of Appeal saw fit to respond to my concern by email on 2 October at 10:24am.  That is to say they (to the best of my knowledge) refused to look into the conflict and / or refused to do anything at all about the apparent conflict.</p>

    <p>K Cornege of Thompkins Wake also pointed out to me that the finding of P Cornege being conflicted out of representing anybody who was opposed by the University of Waikato since they had put a dollar in her pocket - was a finding that I was supposed to keep secret and not publicise.  That he sat on filings for several months only later to claim to be conflicted out was also something that I was supposed to keep secret and not publicise.  If the Law Society had seen fit to do it's job properly then I wouldn't need to publicise it becuase things would have been dealt with internally, in house.  But the Law Society brushed off my complaint / blew off my complaint.  So I now inform the public so they know what kind of people they may be dealing with.  I see that P Cornege is now claiming on his website to be employed by the Government for the abuse in state care inquiry.  I wonder if this is because they have collected up evidence of him being willing to delay proceedings and being willing to blame the complainant (e.g., construe Roe v University of Waikato as my being upset I did not get my qualification rather than an issue to do with how they are incorrectly invoicing students and how they are mishandling official thesis documents etc).
    </p>

    <p>You can see from the letter that the Law Society said I needed to pay them $50 if I wanted to take the complaint further.  I should pay for the corruption in the Law Profession.  I should pay the Law Society who is supposed to collect fees from Lawyers to uphold the integrity of the Law Profession.  I did the filings for taking the complaint further so they could take a look and see whether Philip Cornege and K Cornege were behaving appropriately as lawyers (hey, they picked them out all special like to be graduates of New Zealand Law Degrees and they picked them out all special like to be registered to practice Law in New Zealand)..  I filed that IF Mr Cornege was in fact conflicted out (as the Law Society found that he was) THEN he did not get to have a professional opinion on the mertits of the case.  That is to say, if he is conflicted out, then it is not appropriate for him to choose to delay proceedings for a couple months and then refuse to file anything other than a statement that he did not see merits in the case.  He tried to throw the case, in other words.  He was conflicted and how he chose to manage or handle the conflict was to tell me that the case was not a matter of law (not a matter of misuse of official document and incorrect invoicing of the government by keeping false records about enrolmetn and keeping false records about progression through qualification by re-enrolling a studnet in programmes they had never even applied to) and so on.  Instead, he tried to blame me for being personally upset that they did not give me the qualification.  Of course I was also personally upset but I wasn't expecting the law to do anything about personal upset.  Justice and fairness and upholding the law is supposed to be what the law is about. It is more than a little concerning that the Corneges and indeed the Supreme Court Injustices don't seem to have the conception.  Or maybe they just don't have the ability. 
    </p>


    <p>Universitites, District Health Boards, Government Departments are not being fair in the way they handle (actually mis-handle) applications.  Concrete examples.  The University of Waikato wanted to have a yakkity yak yak yak yak yak about why I had not been ranked for PhD (doctoral) scholarship in their meeting about who was going to be granted doctoral scholarships when I never applied to the doctoral programme with that University.  The Waikato District Health Board advertised a $5,000 masters research scholarship where the successful candidate was to give a talk to the DHB.  I have repeatedly asked (including under OIA) for the name of the receipient of that scholarship in 2018 because I have a strong suspicion that they did not give the funding to any actual student and instead decided to have a party party party for themselves.  They refuse to supply me with information as to when the student gave their talk to the DHB and where there masters research thesis actually is so that I can see the project that they funded with public money (yeah, right).
    </p>

    <p>New Zealand is a shit-hole (as is Australia) because the leaders won't have it any other way.  Suck up, suck up, suck up.  Everything is entirely and totally at the discretion of this, that, and the other person.  Does this person really have the power to decide on personal grounds whether this, that, or the other  happens?  Well, better do anything anything anything they say.  Just in case.  You can always say you were just following orders, right?  Wasn't me.  The singularity ordered it.  I wasn't driving that car or that drone or the tank.  It was the singularity that did it.  No people.  Nobody home.  Nothing to see.
    </p>

    <p>There is no health system. No education system.  To training system.  No functioning judiciary.  Parliament is a joke or a fraud.  I mean, c'mon, they pull a piece of paper seemingly randomly from out of a biscut tin and squabble in front of a guy sitting on a sheepskin throne who orders the sprinkers to be turned on to anybody who thinks that this ia a fucking hoax of a fraud of a farce of a situation.  We don't have medical doctors.  Too busy getting in behind the likes of Dr Leeks.  All of the money and the power and the titles for him.  Nobody else wanted to do it.  See?  No other Medical Graduates.  Nobody else got registration with the professional body or association.  There's  nothing to see.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  They are building the bomb shelters now, under the children's hospitals.  Of course.  I mean, where else would you build a bomb shelter but under the children's hospital.  No health system no education system no judiciary nothing nothing nothing at all.
    </p>

    <p>I am sick to death of all the f*cking excuses about why I don't count and why the laws don't apply to me.  Everybody is like 'you think the laws don't apply to you'.  And it's like 'I know you are but what am I?'  I mean...  What is the appropriate response or reply, here?  They think that the laws don't apply to anybody at all.  That's how they live their lives.  They just do whatever they want whenever they want because they want.  Hand out grades on non-academic grounds for whatever reasons they want, hand out applications (or withhold applications) for whatever reasons they want.  And so on.  Apparently my grades don't count because they were handed out before they really got underway with the whole grade-fixing thing (as in giving all the best grades to the teachers and administrators kids or the people who pay the most in bribes).  That's why my grades don't count.  And because it's a fucking embarrassment when you compare all the work that I've done against all the work that the people on payroll have done.  I mean, I get that when you edit a journal you get to delay receipt of publication until you have bullied the junior people into fleeing with no credit at which point you can distribute the credit to other parties.  Right?  That's how Sterelny made his career?  Right?  Being an editor of a journal being sent everybodies work for him to distribute around as he sees fit.  He sees fit to make Carl Brusse enrol in PhD x2 otherwise Carl Brusse doesn't get credit for 360 points or 3 EFTS of research work.  Right?  He doesn't acknowledge any of the work that Carl Brusse did on personal identity etc.  No.  He will give Carl Brusse some work that Carle Brusse can pass off as his own and take credit for.  Work written by Carl Brusse taking all of the things that Sterelny gave him to say and saying that only.  Right?  That's how it goes?  Progressively replace it with plagarised stuff.  That's what they like to try and teach at Auckland.  Wah wah wah Maaori can't do academics because we won't accept any work from them that is not sufficiently plagarised.  Hey, I know...  Let's write about how it's morally obligatory to uplift children and arrange for them to be abused in state care (but only if their parents aren't abusing them sufficiently at home or the schools haven't arranged for them to be sufficiently abused there).  Not exactly the developed world.  Nothing to see...  Nothing nothing nothing at all...
    </p>

    <p>So apparently NZ is going to open up immigration to old people, now.  We got the euthanasia drugs, especially.  I mean, we had the highest rates of child abuse (physical, sexual, psychological) and look how much money we made!  Look at how much money we collected from people who arranged to have their kids sent here and abused by various people, in New Zealand.  Well, the quality of our aged care institutions preceeds the opening of immigration to all the elderly people of the world.  Roll up roll up roll up for everything it is that you value!  New Zealand.  Quite the sh*t show.  Not even the teensiest bit of 'try'.  Do you see evidence of 'try'?  I don't...  I keep loooking (not doing the confirmation bias thing) but I don't see evidence of 'try'.  Do you?
    </p>

    <p>14 October 12:18pm</p>

    <p>Australia thinks that if New Zealand is made to look worse then Australia will look better by default.  In other words, instead of Australia focusing on improving, Australia can focus on undermining and stabotaging New Zealand.  Force New Zealand to be a costly fitness trap on the world stage, right, Sterelny?  Make Australia look positively *attractive* by way of comparison only.  
    </p>

    <p>Evidence for this is how various high-quality New Zealanders get hand-picked out (all special-like) as something along the lines for reward for their service in undermining and stabotaging New Zealand.  For example, Dr Leeks.  Most esteemed Psychiatrist.   I mean, it wasn't like anybody else wanted to do it, it wasn't like anybody else had the capacity to do it.  He was the only game in town.  He was the 'there is no alternative'.  And for all the hard work that he did pimping out the kids to...  The only church leaders who the government hadn't imprisoned, and the like...  His reward was to be shipped to Melbourne so he could continue on his offending against the people of Melbourne.  When it was time for him to be held to account for his crimes he allegedly or apparently died.  Yeah right.  Where did they ship him next?  Brisbane?  Another example:  All the work that the Sterelny's did on slavery and psychopathy.  Must  have.  All the high quality supervision they provided.  I mean, it isn't like anybody else wants to have academic careers.  Right?  It isn't like New Zealand has graduates.  It isn't like the Universities will pay graduates to work in them.  Is it 1 academic per 1,000 kids, now?  Who runs the tutorials?  The second years tutor the first years. But I think you need to pay Crimson Education (the only kind of business that can exist or subsist or persist in New Zealand) for the questions or the answers or both.  Right?  That's a model of a New Zealand start-up, right there.  Brought to you by the University of Auckland, wasn't it?  Helping them decide how they were going to fix the grades.  I am not saying that the person who pays the most money gets the places in Medicine.  It is more the hint hint wink wink nudge nudge maybe...  Just maybe...  Just maybe...  Oooooh.  How much do you want to do it?  How much will people pay?  How much did Dr Leeks pay to get to commit atrocities against the New Zealand people?  HOw much did he pay to get to commit atrocities against the Australian people?  How much did the government pay him in order to do those things?  How much does the government pay to ensure that only these kinds of people are the only game in town.  Harlene Hayes.  Quite the number that she did on the University of Otago.  you should live-stream the Ethics seminars and the Psychology Seminars and quite a few of the other Seminars.  So the people can see the kinds of seminars.  They are practically pulling out the gibbet cages.  That appears to be the function of much of it.  They get people giving seminars on how they are planning to change the laws of New Zealand so that they can do experiments on people with alzheimer's and dementia without their consent and so on and so forth.  Medical atrocities, in other words.  They get people giving seminars on how they falsely accuse people of crimes, unlawfully detain them, do not read them their Miranda Rights (torture them into speaking and false confessions, refuse to allow them lawyers etc).  These are the sorts of seminars that they have while filming the reactions or responses of the attendees.  Not a University.  Hey.  Nothing to see.  Nothing nothing nothing, at all.
    </p>

    <p>Australia thinks it funny (haha) that New Zealand functions as a back door for Australia.  It likes to think that New Zealand is a little slave or detention camp and it can pick out whomever it wants for whatever arbitrary reasons it wants and promote those people to Australia.  But look at the people who they choose to promote to Australia.  They wanted Dr Leeks.  Must have.  They wanted the Sterelny's.  They wanted Harlene Hayes.  Where is Stuart McCutcheon?  Where is Ashley Bloomfield?  He earned how many millions of dollars in their public servant roles?  How many millions of dollars?  About half a million dollars each, supposedly, or apparently.  For how many years of work?  What currency did they try and convert into?  At what point does that kind of thing undermine the currency of New Zealand?  I mean, how are the Americans supposed to think or feel about Ashley earning more than Fauci (given the exchange rate)?  How much money should have to pay to get his kids into Harvard so they can go party with Fauci's kids?  The value of the New Zealand dollar.  When the civil servants of New Zealand try and launder the money out.

    <p>Why did Australia go all heavy-handed trying to ban the purchase of certain computer games?  I've been trying to understand.  I suppose the most likely explanation is that it creates increased or additional demand for that which has been banned.  I don't know what effect banning the game had on sales in that region and perhaps in other regions as well.  But if we do take it at face value...  They contributed to the Borderlands franchise.  Australians.  Take 2.  Australian and the USA co-operated to make Borderlands (prior to Tiny Tina, anyway).  That was considered acceptable.  Those tales.  That world-view.  Etc.  They did not have any problems with Australians buying and playing anything in the Bio-Shock Franchise.  Bio-Shock franchise (arguably) provides in-game benefits for smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol.  The Borderlands theme song is a fair representation of what that franchise has to tell the kiddies about life.  Then Australia banned We Happy Few.  Supposedly because of in-game benefits to drug-taking.  This was then, apparently, rescinded on grounds that the overall message or theme was that drug-taking was not the good, right, best thing to do.  That the overall message was not to take drugs.  But surely Australian's aren't that stupid.  Right?  I mean, the reason why they lifted the ban was the real reason for why it was banned in the first place.  Right?  Too close to home.  We Happy Few.  Too close to home, indeed.  Rimworld was also banned.  I was trying to understand why that might be.  Interesting model of psychopathic break.  Hey.  Also interesting model of people having both strengths and weaknesses and not all being the same.  Having passion for things which increases work-speed and skill-up.  Quite a lot about the entire world-view of Rimworld is interesting. A little similarly to how the Sims has been interesting for it's view of personality and needs and so on.  Anyway...  Suppose the aim was to induce psychotic breaks so that only a few people were left.  The happy few,  of course.  The happiness that people get from smug self-satisfaction of being the only game in town, the only people left standing.  There really isn't a health system, an education system, a functioning judiciary.  Not so far as I can see.  It's all designed to psychotic break as many as possible.  I have been thinking about heads on spikes and gibbet cages, more recently.  The kind of 'art' they like to have strewn about 'universities' and the like.  
    </p>

    <p>What is Harvard, anyway?  How many countries are there in the world?  If they took the kids of the wealthiest people of every country and called that a cohort then how many kids would there be?  Why would wealthy kids want to go to college at all?  Oh, for the parties, sure.  I guess they can pay to do anything anything anything to the other kids?  No?  Maybe the vauge promise of that is somehow alluring...  Where are the research ouputs of the University?  New Zealand seems to put out a beacon for the psychopaths.  I mean...  Where are the research outputs of the Universities of New Zealand?  n media output.  Instead of journals?  There is the New Zealand Medical Students Journal on high gloss paper.  But the articles are written by people with Professor titles and not (for the most part) by Medical Students.  Where are the journals for the people with Professor titles?  They are supposed to contribute to n media output only?  The con-munications from the con-munications department of the 'university'?  
    </p>

    <p>Where does the research funding go?  They cite 'privacy' -- but privacy is not supposed to be a mechanism for covering up crimes.  The 'universities' and 'hospitals' allegedly or apparently receive money from the government to pay people to do research.  THey will advertise 'student scholarships' and in return people provide to them information about research projects they would like to do or sometimes ones that will be done whether they get funding for them or not.  The people who have collected the information then ensure that the person who applied for funding does not recieve any funding at all and they appropriate their work for themselves or their own.  That is or means to say, if you apply for Masters scholarship funding they will pass off the application for funding as their own output and then not fund you.  Then they bully you into abandoning your research output which they then will pass off as their own.  How much money has the New Zealand government and the Australian Government paid to OTHER PEOPLE for all of the work outputs that I have done?  How many people on payroll to steal and misappropriate the work of others?  You can't get patients or whatever in New Zealand.  Any application for funding or any application for patient or whatever will be delayed and delayed and delayed while other people profit.  There is nothing here.  Nada.  Zip.  Zilch.  Zero.  Evidence to the contrary...  Evidence to the contrary.   I'm looking...  I'm looking...  I wasn't a greedy greedy grub needing to greedy greedy grub all the titles and honors and awards and money for myself.  I did not greedy greedy grub my way to PhD at 25 (I didn't give a shit about getting a PhD from the University of Waikato -- I wanted to learn more.  But Australasia doesn't have tertiary education institutions of learning.  They pay Sterelny to explain to me about how I'm to be kept as slave working working workign for no pay if I am not suitably incentivised to greedy greedy grubbity grub all the money then I can be kept or detained or held as slave then).  There aren't any hospitals there aren't any tertiary education places there aren't any training systems..  Just detention camps institutions of slavery up and down the land...  Will not pay the workers.  Will not process the applications.  Won't process applications for training, funding, employment.  Won't do it.  Nothing to see people.  Nothing here.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  They chose to declare WWIII.  The Governments.  Where is the evidence to the contrary?  Where is the 'try'?  
    </p>

<p>The University of Auckland wasted my f*cking time telling me (falsely, they did not have the authority to say this) that I needed to complete a new qualification from a NZ Univeristy for purposes of 'eligibility' to apply to MBChB.  I was acting on their incorrect advice when I applied to be enrolled in a 120 point MPhil with Waikato in 2018 with a 05 March start date by the application deadline.  I have evidence of someone employed by Waikato as an academic in the Philosophy Programme saying that she was willing to supervise me in that particular programme.  Of course she was.  She was employed by the University and she didn't have too many other research students.  I was the only applicant for the Philosophy Research Programme?  The Programme was not over-subscribed.  Unless, of course, the entire University does not have the capacity or willingness to do research.  It is not a Univesrity, I mean to say.  Well then, shut it down.  No more money.  Not a Univesrity.  No new enrollments.  I have evidence of working under supervision.  I mean to say, I regularly sent work and got emailed responses like 'I'm going away on holiday next week' and 'I'm off now, for some family time'.  My 6 monthly report was not released to me until well after 6 months so I couldn't possibly fill it out until it was released to me.  It was overall 'satisfactory' -- but my supervisor said that 'extra time' would make it better and she expected me to do 'extra time'.  You mean slave-work for the University?  You mean I should be forced to work over and above and beyond the requirements of the qualification otherwise you will withhold the qualification (and even if I do the extra time you will still withhold the qualification because you don't have a university you have a slave detention camp).  I submitted my work on 14 September 2018.  They deny it.  I have receipts from the University of Otago printery for them printing and soft-binding 3x 50,000 word thesis on 13 September 2018.  I have track and trace number from courier saying they had a signature on a delivery of 2 packages (containing 3 theses) that had been shipped to Professor Kay Weaver in her capacity as Dean of the School of Research, University of Waikato.  They deny they received my thesis.  They refused to send it to externals.  They say I don't get to submit it for examination without their permission.  They say they wanted me to keep slaving for the University.  They say they will fail me outright unless I agree to 'voluntarily' withhdraw the submission.  That means to say, if I don't agree with them that I have not submitted a thesis for external examination then they are telling me they will simply record on my transcript that I failed.  This is not a university.  Where are the official documents that I submitted to the University for the purposes of external examination for the 120 point MPhil Degree only?  Where are they?  
</p>

<p>
The University invoiced me for extra-time.  The University invoiced the government for extra-time.  The Inland Revenue informs me that I was enrolled for extra-time and I have additional fees added to my Student Loan.  I did not apply to the Inland Revenue to be enrolled in that, however.  They are keeping false records about me.
</p>

<p>I did everything required to complete the 120 point MPhil qualification in the 'minimum, normal, or standard time' which is what the University of Auckland told me they required of me.  The University of Waikato did not do anything they were required to do.  They refused to get my thesis out to external examiners and they refused to base the outcome of examination on reports of external examiners.  They decided to fail me themselves before they even obtained reports of external examienrs.  They never received any reports from external examiners for my thesis submission of 14 September 2018 becuase they never sent the thesis out for external examination at all.  Where is the research output of the 'university' of Waikato?  Well, then, we will have to hire people from overseas..  We will have to hire immigrants and migrants because we don't have any graduates in New Zealand.  No New Zealanders wanted to enrol, wanted to graduate, wanted to work those jobs.  We will have to recruit from overseas  because we won't pay New Zealanders.  Will we pay the overseas migrants, then?  No..  We will say we don't acknowledge their training and qualifications and experience and we will require them to then..  What?  Slave and slave and slave to become like locals?  So, when they are locals what will happen?  Well, then they can slave and slave and slave to be slaves.  Welcome to New Zealand.  Better life.   Hey.  There are a happy few, allegedly or apparently.  The smug self satisfaction of being unlawfully hauled out of retirement to be reappointed as Judge for the High Court Proceeding of Roe vs University of Waikato.  To investigate the death of Mason Pendrous.
</p>

<p>The Univesrity of Auckland did not have authority to tell me that I needed to complete a new qualification (e.g, the 120 point MPhil) for eligibility to be enrolled in Medicine.  The Education Act proclaims me (as a domestic adult) to be eligible.  They are corrupt in how they allocate training places for Medicine.  I suppose that is because they are looking for the next Dr Leeks.  The best reason why I can think of for why Wellington needed a new childrens hospital (that they have no intention of properly staffing) is becuase the people in Wellington have seen fit to want for themselves some kind of bomb shelter infrastructure.  I can't think of a  better reason why given everything else going on in New Zealand.  Can you?  The Government has chosen to declare WWIII on the people.  There arent' any public or social services.  They won't pay the workers.  They won't advertise the jobs, they won't employ people to work those jobs.  They insist on employing people without the willingness or ability (e.g, Chris Whelan who has only worked to completely and utterly undermine the quality and integrity of New Zealand Universities by refusing to acknoweldge receipt of complaints and refusing to sort out complaints in house).  The Government has chosen to be corrupt.  So...  The crimes of the New Zealand government against the people.  It is written into the Australian Constitution that New Zealand is a State of Australia.  So then, were are the New Zealander's voting papers?  Why is it that the Australian Government refuses to process or progress or acknowledge or supply applications to New Zealanders for various things.  The Australian Government is not a developed world government.  They aren't even trying to be a Government of a free and democratic Country.  They are trying to manage a slave-colony only.</p>

<p>__CORRUPTION__

</p>

<p>
I have asked under Official Information Act request for information to know who is employed by the Auckland DHB in clinical roles.  Medical Doctors.  So, something that says, what FTE position they have.  That's 'full time equivlent' position.  How many hours they are on payroll to work.  What position they have (e.g., consultant psychiatrist).  How much money is associated with that position for that FTE that they are working.  A list, please.  So we can see who the individuals are who are actually being paid to work in the hospitals in clinical roles.  The response I get from them is something along the lines of 'duuuuuuh we no understand-y your question' and, of course, they refuse to supply the information.</p>

<p>
I am sure that you could do the same for all of the other executive government positions.  Who is on payroll for how many FTE as nurses?  Teachers in the schools?  Tell us their position title.  Why?  Because... The country has been progressively gutted.  That's why.  All of the infrastructure has been progressively taken out or removed or not purchased, and nobody, really, appears to be on payroll.
 </p>

 <p>So, the laboratories at University are 'taught' by second year students.  How much do they pay them per hour?  And so on...  ALL THE WAY UP.  That is, or means to say, how many PhD graduates are there, actually, working in research and teaching jobs (how many FTE)?  They stopped graduating graduate research students...  How many years ago...  ??  Hmm...  And they get people enrolled in their 3EFT PhD for...  How many years, again?  Just taking their research and taking their research and taking their research...  While a few children of the administrators or similar) scuttle their way through to full time equivalent payroll positions where they can spend their time skiing or playing golf.  There's nothing there.  Nobody home.  Party party party.  Corruption.
</p>

<p>When the University of Otago refused to graduate 1/3 of it's medical cohort (claiming that it had discretionary power to refuse to accept that they had been signed off on completion of their workplace internship requirement)...  Those same students were (alledgedly or apparently) still going to be going on to their junior doctor positions in the hospitals.  But they weren't going to be paid junior doctor salary.  Rather, they were going to need to keep paying the university for more re-enrolment in the qualification.  While filling the junior doctor position.  So...  What happened with that?  The various DHB's up and down the country gave them registration numbers?  No?  Withheld them.  So they can't prescribe any medication, then.  They can't write any prescriptions because they won't have a registration or authorisation number to do that.  So the pharmacy can't fill the script.  Right?  So we have medical students passing themselves off as medical doctors.  No registration number.  No ability to prescribe medication.  Just get in there and have a go.  Right?  How are you going to make money to pay your medical student fees?  Maybe you can find a way to pimp your patients out?  Sell organs?  Maybe sell tickets to operations?  How much money do you think some tourist would pay to sexually abuse this, that, or the other of your patients while they are kept under general anasthetic?
</p>

<p>Where is the evidence that these things are not happening regularly, reliably, as a matter of course in NZ hospitals?  Why isn't the University of Auckland required to input my GPA (according to their published algorithm), input my UMAT / UCAT score, input my interview score, and offer me a place (or not) on the basis of my rank order score?  The search for the next Dr Leeks...  Let me guess...  Janet Frame would never have written her works of literature if she hadn't have been abused and mistreated in our hospital detention system so...  Well then, it's practically morally obligatory!!!
    </p>

    <p>Isn't it nice to know that you can appeal to the Rt Honorable Jacinda Ardern PhD to have her reconsider decisions from the executive branch of Government in New Zealand?  Don't like a decision of the executive (e.g., creative New Zealand) then you can cry cry cry to Jacinda (preferably by way of shaming the running of this country in foreign media) and then she can announce that she has chosen to make a special personal exemption out of the kindness and goodness of her heart (ooooooh most kind and benevolent and merciful leader!) to redelegate the issue to something that..   Is it Chris Hipkins Mummy?  Has some decision making power over (on entirely independent grounds, of course).  And the idea of keeping a team of, was it 4 or 5 million people in lockdown...  Well, now they are deciding to choose to use their discretion to engage in a more targeted approach.  Deciding on quite personal grounds who is specially chosen to  be excluded.  Out of the malevolence of their hearts, one can only suppose.  
    </p>

    <p>And, of course, we get rid of people by themm voluntarily choosing to stand down.  It wasn't that any kind of fair process required Ashley to stand down, for example.  Rather, he was bullied into volunteering.  That's another very distinctive Kiwi thing.  All the way up.  That's how parliament leads by example.  The aim is to bully people into volunteering.  That's what voluntary means.  When the St Johns Volunteers find you helpless on the street and they donate you to the hosptial all voluntary like so that the hospital can get ransom paid for every night they keep you detained in conditions the UN would likely regard torture...  You have been volunteered.  See how that works?   If you don't pay people (e.g., ambulance officers, firemen, teachers, lecturers, doctors, nurses, gangsters) then they have to get their money somehow.  What's that?  You pay them by the number of hostages they keep detained in conditions of torture?  Pay by the head, is it?  By the bed.  I suppose you pay flow managers to direct the streaming.  The flow of people where the government has, effectively, put a bounty on their heads...  Not a developed nation, at all.  Not even trying to be.  Evidence of try????  Evidence of try....  Evidence of try...  They can't even get a thesis and get it to external examiners.  No evidence of try.  NOthing to see.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.
    </p>

    <p>The 'University' 'Academics' can't really strike,  because they don't really do anything.  If they don't turn up to give their lectures the University can simply get a second year volunteer (if he wants to possibly pass then he will do what he's told) to play the video recording of the teaching of the lecture last year.  If they don't do grading then they can throw them up the stairs or otherwise randomly assign the grades, like they usually do, or the council can allocate grades on the basis of information like the decile score of the parents address or the deprivation of the high school last attended or the race or disability information or whatever whatever whatever.  Make sure the kids of the wealthy elite take up their places at the head or the top of the class and make sure the kids who the government wants to keep immobilised in poverty doing anything anything anything John Key says outside a nightclub on a Friday night are required to do just that.  No?  That's not how New Zealand doesn't work?  Really?  Evidence to the contrary?
    </p>

    <p>What about the research work?  Well, they could take the research ourputs of the undergraduates and change the author's name on them so that they are attributed to..  I don't know.  SQuiggley himself.  Say.  What is the student going to do about that?  Nothing if they want any possibility of passing at all.  I would say.
    </p>

    <p>So, then.  All of the money that was supposed to pay for Professors and so on to teach and do research at the Univesrities of New Zealand...  That doesnt' need to be spent on any Professors at all.  Don't need professors anymore than you need medical consultants or nurses or anything anything anything at all.  Hey.  Perhaps the kids can just write to Jacinda and Jacinda can decide what grades each one should get.  Assess the begging on the basis of how kind she feels today.  How benevolent or otherwise.  Totally at her discretion.  Of course.
    </p>

    <p>I mean, whoever is actually on payroll now...  THey will be good for the next 50 years.  Right?  And if they die...  Well, I'm sure that their dependents can figure how to distribute their paycheck amongst themselves so no point telling anybody they are dead.  Right?  Don't worry, they are just skiing or playing golf like the people on payroll are usually on payroll to do.  Right?  
    </p>

    <p>New Zealand.  It's not working.
    </p>

    <p>How old is Winston Peters, now?  I remember the very very very very first MMP election that New Zealand had.  Everything stopped for a couple weeks while he decided who he was going to form a government with.  And every election ever since.  Right?  I don't know why the Government doesn't imprison him.  I mean, they imprison Brian Tamaki...  Why not simply imprison Winston and simply refuse, then, to progress or process any of his legal filings?  I mean, simply order that his lawyers revise and resubmit the filings and then instruct them to bloat the filings like they instructed or allowed or encouraged the kim.com lawyers to do.  To take up a bunch of court time...  But hold Winston in detention during all of the goings on.  I am not sure why Winston does not get imprisoned by the government.  Nobody else wants to do it.  Hey.  No...  Intellectual heir.  No younger people being trained.  Trained to do what?  Do we really want anymore people doing what these people are doing?  No.  We do not.  We want for things to be better.  But then anybody with the willingness or ability to do better needs to be exterminated or shut down for making these people look like they are not the only show in town.  The there is no alternative we win by default.  If you don't like squabbling and bickering and bitching and moaning your life away then flee New Zealand, then.  So say all the governments of the world.  Busily busily conspiring for there to be no justice no health no cutlure no value no meaning nothing nohting nohting.  Nothing to see.  Nothing of any value.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  Nada zip zilch zero.  Wasteland of the garbage heap of nothing.  Nasty bruitish and short.
    </p>

    <p>ADHD AND MEDICATION
    </p>

    <p>Everybody functions better on the ADHB meds.  I mean to say, everybody functions better on the ADHB meds comparably or similarly to how everybody functions better on caffine.  I mean to say, the medication improves everybody's ability to focus or concentrate.  Briefly.  For a time.  And then you have a rebound or comedown.  For every pro there is a con.  For every high there is a low.  That kind of a thing.  So then...  Well, then, you want to take some more.  But your body adapts to it and metabolises it better.  So you need more and more and more to have that same affect.  And then the lows become lower...  And so...  It can be hard to know...  Some people can take just a little and they swear by that.  Years and years pass and they have the same dose they always had and they say that it really seems to sort them out.  Who am I to know better than them what is right or good for them?  But others do not find this to be the case.  They seek out more and more and they are more and more and more bothered when they don't get the doses they are seeking.  And then you add in to this whole situation the issue of children.  Parents (or the children) giving or selling or being bullied into handing over their doses so that other kids can have them around examination time, or for a little fun on a Friday night, or what have you.  And the situation is pretty complicated.  Needs to be assessed on a case by case basis.  What is in the best interests of the person who is supposed to be having the dose.  I mean to say.</p>

    <p>That is why there is supposed to be checks and balances so that only one person is not responsible or accountable for decision to allow the supply of or withhold.  So, a GP needs to put in a referral to a specialist.  Some GP's won't do that.  Or will only put in a referral to a specialist who will never give the patient the appointment.  Is another way of nicely refusing to refer, I suppose.  Then the specialsts are a second step.  Psychiatrist for adults.  Pediatrician for youth.  To assess whether it actually is in the patients best interests to have access to the medication.  Will they be the one taking it?  Will they take it as they are supopsed to for the reasons they are saying when they are seeking?  Or are they trafficking the doses to someone else?  Saving them up to have recreational high?  Will it be a stepping stone for them seeking higher and higher doses?  And so on. It is complicated.  
    </p>

    <p>And then you add to that...  Well...  I'm still waiting on the list of FTE positions filled.  How many consultant (that is to say fully qualified not studnets anymore) psychiatrists are there on payroll with the ADHB, say?  What do you reckon?  Do you reckon that there might be...  5?  5FTE?  Filled by maybe 10 different individuals (so each one on payroll for only 0.5FTE?)  What numbers would you think?  The answer to this, apparently, is that they list in their outgoing on their accounts 'external consultant five million' (say) without further specification as where that money goes.  I mean to say, I think that it likely is the case in fact that General Practitioners are truly unable to get specialists to see their patients in a timely fashion, in New Zealand.  But if that is the case...  I mean...  My understanding is that the point of a registration number is that that is what accompanies prescriptions.  So it is an authorisation number.  So, then, the pharmacies see who is prescribing what (and they can see if someone is prescribing a lot of morphene, say, or amphetamine medications).  But New Zealand being New Zealand I would suppose that that's how people are required to make their money.  Trafficking drugs, basically.  Writing false prescriptions, also, I would imagine.  For false patients, I mean to say.  I bet the health records are a real mess as they try and make it look like they are distributing mass amounts of amphetamine or morphene or whatever around. Corruption.  Hey.
    </p>

    <p>Try, in the public hospitals...  Try asking the person who is pretending to be a medical doctor..  Try asking them for their name, position title (e.g., consultant, registrar, undergraduate level medical student), and registration number (which, I believe, indicates whether or not they are allowed to prescribe medication).  You will mostly find them not having their photograph identification anywhere that is easily viewable by patients.  I really respect the old-school nurses who wear their identification cards on the front of their uniforms so that you can identify them as legit nurses.  But the move is more and more and more to discourage or dissuade people from doing this so that generally you really have no idea who the hell anybody is in the hospitals.  That is because..  Well..  Who the hell is in our hospitals?  Sexual offenders trafficking for 'opportunity'?  I mean, seriously?  I am trying to think of why it would be that the doctors and the nurses (and the studnet doctors and the student nurses) and so on..  Wouldn't be required to wear photograph name badges stating clearly their job title.  Are they are nursing student (in the capacity as student) or healthcare assistant (in the capacity as that)?  If they are a student then who is directly responsible for teaching or supervising them right now?  If they are a healthcare assistant then there would be clear tasks or jobs being done by them, that one would expect to be being done by them.  Who are the qualified nurses on payroll in their capacity as qualified nurse?  Same for the doctors and so on?  What we have is people not meeting eye contact and scuttling about surreptitously..  We don't appear to have hospitals.  
    </p>

    <p>I have no idea why Dr Sharma wants to do politics rather than practice Medicine.  But, hey, I guess Medicine is sooooooo competitive they need to restrict the number of people who are trained to practice clinical medicine and then have the few people who are trained to practice clinical medicine do something else.  Work for the Ministry like Ashley Bloomfield (who likely got paid more not to practice medicine than he ever would have bene paid to practice medicine).  Run for politics.  Sure.  I guess getting in to medical school is good training for politics.  I do understand why he would not want to be at the mercy of Jacinda Ardern's (or the Labor party's) discretion.  I don't think that any of the people of New Zealand would seriously question why he would not want to be at the mercy of Jacinda Ardern's discretion.  The people get very very mixed messages, indeed, about the scope and powers of Jacinda Ardern's discretion to do whatever she wants with complete and utter impunity.  On the one hand we hear that it isn't her personal decision and there isn't anything that she can do.  On the other hand we hear that she put in a word here or there and then, all of a sudden, the Ministry of Education is going to fund something.  It could be my imagination...  But I was fairly sure that around the time when Chris Hipkins was home for Christmas and realised he did not pack a suit for an impromptu media thing something something was said about his mother working in some high up capacity in the Ministry of Education.  Is that right?  I don't know what the role was...  If she was writing the test questions or answers or both..  If she was involved in external contract to payroll people who were to do that...  I don't know...  
    </p>

    <p>I don't know why we would think that Olivia Podmore killed herself.  That's what the Medical person said.  Right?  That it was a suicide?  I guess that's what they are required to say in order to be on Government payroll.  Right?  Was there any kind of independent investigation or report from the perspective of her being murdered by the same people who were involved in covering up the crimes of New Zealand cycling?  I mean, what seems most likely?  They wanted to shut her up?  Seems most likely to me.  Intuitively plausible...  Various other people, too.  Mason Pendrous.  Since they got Justice Toogood out of retirement for the occasion seems the Government was really really keen to have a known quantity giving them what they wanted in or with that investigation.  Payrolled him for Roe v University of Waikato, as well, hey.  Various other cases...  There was this thing about cleaners posting photographs of crimes scenes they had been called into clean up, at some point.  I would imagine the main problem there would be that it would be fairly clear, often, at an incredibly superficial level that it was not a suicide.  I wonder how many of New Zealand's suicides are really government murders.  Quite a few, I would imagine.  For all the work and energy and effort that goes into finding the next Dr Leeks and so on and so forth to be the only doctors on payroll by the New Zealand Government to work in the hospitals.  All the work and energy and effort that was directed into keeping me out, for example.  Because I am such a monster, hey.  Obviously and clearly.  Such a f*cking monster.  That's me.  Yeah, right.
    </p>

    <p>I think that part of it is that Dr Leeks is celebrated from within some segment of the Medical Profession.  Some people get pretty f*cked up ideas about what needs to happen in order for science progress to occur.  Like how with prison architect you can make a game (actually build it or design it) so that it is more financially lucrative to keep the prisoners in humane conditions where they get treatment and rehab and are kept happy.  Some people will insist on playing the game to keep them in conditions of deprivation and upset.  Some people will insist on things being punative.  They will say that it is more expensive or it is costly or whatever to keep them happy and humanely.  But that can be demonstrably shown to be garbage.  It was a function or feature of their own psychology or pathology or whatever to choose to keep them poorly at great cost to everyone and everything.  Now, I'm not saying that prison architect (the video game) was actually designed to be like that.  I am saying that it would be possible to design a game that was like that.  And then see how various people choose to play it.  I think that people would likely agree (if you are honest and not just arguing for arguings sake because you don't have better things to do with your time) that quite a few people would still choose to manage or run things in a manner or way that is punative.  They like to be punative.  They enjoy misusing or abusing power in order to keep others in punative conditions if they can get away with it.  Of course some people may do that in a video game (that doesn't actually involve real people) and not in real life.  But I do think that many people would also do this in real life if they thought they could get away with it.
    </p>

    <p>The medical community also has all these ideas or ideals about how poorly and deprived and inhumanely we need to keep people in order for there to be medical or scientific progress.  They say that the very very best science is inhumane and so on.  That's something they think it intrinsic or essential to science.  Like how keeping people cheaply is deprivation inducing and inhumane scientific progress is deprivation inducing and inhumane.
    </p>

    <p>Harry Harlow...  To study the nature of love...  Designed devices like the 'rape rack' and so on.  He wanted to learn about love, allegedly or apparently.  So he kept primates in conditions of extreme deprivation.  New Zealand often seems to be designed as some primate research lab on homo sapiens.  The abuse in state care.  Harry Harlow's primate research laboratory rolled out for homo sapiens.  In the name of love.  In the name of scientific progress.  Deprivation inducing.  Inhumane.  Because why not if you are getting away with it.  Must be cheaper.  Right? 
    </p>

    <p>Clockwork Orange was about trying to use electrical stimulation (shocks and the like) to change people's sexual response.  The focus was supposed to be on curing people of homosexuality.  But really, the focus in the wild (for Dr Leeks, let's say) was on trying to get little boys to sexually respond to adult men (particularly).  Right?  That was what he was mostly up to.  Right?  So he could pimp them out.  Right?  Maybe because the Government wouldn't pay for anybody to do psychiatry?  Was that the thing?  So he had to make his money somehow or some way...  So how is he supposed to do that, then?  Maybe people would pay him money to take the kids out camping, or what have you.  I don't know.  
    </p>

    <p>Anyway...  They would say that he's done a lot of good, really.  I mean, transgender identification and homosexuality is more acceptable in New Zealand than in many other parts of the world.  And that's because of all the work that people like Dr Leeks did in normalising it.  Right?  As more and more and more and more and more people say 'meeeee tooooooo' the more that all the people of the world will come to realise that pedophilia and so on is a normal and acceptable and probably even desirable part of human life.  Right?  That's the idea?  That's scientific progress, right there?  No?  Evidene to the contrary??  I mean, how could it possibly be *that hard* to progress my application?
    </p>

    <p>The Australian National University...  Upon receiving my complaint the office of the VC instructed me to write a complaint for one of the Deans.  I did that.  She instructed me to write another complaint for another of the Deans.  I did that.  He says that it is not a formal complaint.  I instruct him to regard it as a formal complaint now or then (since they refuse to sort things out informally they insist on making it a formal matter).  They then deny that they have received a formal complaint and direct me to lodge another one.  Why should I have to write 4 complaints to get them to do their f*cking job?  They say I need to prove evidence of my supervisor bullying me.  I have provided to them evidence of work that I have done during my PhD candidature including evidence that administration and my supervisor recieved a 100,000 word thesis document from me.  Where is their evidence of providing supervision or of getting my work out to externals and working to fill job vacancies if they don't have anybody on staff willing and or able to do their job of supervising research candidates?  They aren't functioning as a university at all.  They are functioning as a detention facility only.  They are refusing to process or progress research work from students.  Not a univesrity at all.  What a f*cking farce.
    </p>

    <p>We haven't heard boo about or from Brian Tamaki lately.  Last we heard he was starting up a political party and Jacinda publically scoffed saying he would never get the votes.  The Government and Judiciary have demonstrated they will throw him in prison if it looks like he is getting the support of a segment of society, however, so it is interesting to know his whereabouts and wonder if  he's been suicided if he wasn't heard from him recently.  All voluntary-like, of course.  I don't think that Jacinda really thought very much if at all about how it would look to many New Zealanders for her to take an honorary Degree from Harvard.  I mean, it shows her to be completely and utterly out of touch with the graduate student community in New Zealand, and with a large segment of the undergraduate community as well, I would suppose, for whom they do everything they are supposed to do in order to graduate in a timely fashion or progress through their qualifications but they are not progressed and they are not graduated because of corruption in the public Universities of New Zealand.  I know that she thinks it's some kind of fair and just reward for all the work that she's been doing.  The work for which she is financially remunerated.  Sure.  All the honorary titles and awards for the career-woman who takes her infant along to meetings of the UN (what was supposed to happen if her infant needed or wanted attention when someone else was speaking?).  I don't understand it.  Proclaiming to the world just how willing NZ was to sell out the health of the infants.  Maybe.  I don't know.  I don't understand it.  I guess she was supposed to be sending or selling a message about how she could have allllll the things.  Everything.  Allllll the things for her.  Have a highly paid lucrative career AND have a family too.  Sure.  She should just take allllll the things so that various other people can't have the careers they have worked for or the families since they don't have enough money to do anything much other than cry cry cry cry cry cry cry abotu how the New Zealand government chooses to keep them impoverished and deprived.  Often in institutions.
    </p>

    <p>New Zealand literature...  Let's see...  In the Rubbish Bib.  I remember that one.  A short story about what it's like to grow up in New Zealand.  Literally and metaphorically, as well.  Janet Frame...  Riiiight.  When it was time to pay her to teach...  Class sizes were such that...  And she wasn't really sufficiently trained or taught or supported into the job.  Right?  Hey, teaching is soooooooooo competitive, didn't you know?  When it is time for them to pay you it is time for you to be locked up in an institution.  Look at how we keep our most celebrated artists!  What has changed since Janet Frame?  I know...  If we don't keep people in such appalling conditions of deprivation then they won't produce the arts for us.  Right?  It isn't just in order for science progress that some people must bully and abuse others and keep them poorly in conditions of deprivation. It is necessary for the arts, as well.  I mean it would be positively inhumane and inhumane of us not to keep as many people as possible as badly as possible in institutions as possible.  Not having pay checks to do jobs that we value.  What values?  What jobs?  Nothing to see, people, nothing nothing nothing at all.  ONce they finished paying Jacinda and Ashley and Chris Hipkins and his Mommy and so on and so forth there wasn't any money left.  ANd just as well in the name of science and medicine and the arts, as well.  Riiiight.  That sounds like just the thing in upside down and back to front arse about face-land.  Total sense.
    </p>

    <p>And of course it will result in technology, too.  As people work harder to build bots and so on and so forth to hack into and change and SQuigley fix and so on and so forth the government mis-information and so on.  Don't like your grades?  Change them in the online system, then.  Don't like your pay-roll?  There's a cure for that...  
    </p>

    <p>Like Amber.  Right?  She was sooooooo happpy all the drugs that Dr Glue and the Junior Doctors of the Dunedin Hospital etc etc were feeding her and her friends.  So happy.  So happy.  Anything that you want to do to them.  Right?  So happy.  So happy.  So happy to do whatever the happy few want.  Right?  No other purpose or point or function in life.  Right?  
    </p>

    <p>Auckland's Public Health Message was all 'we don't know how lucky we are  because the US does not have federal or state funded public health system AT ALL they only have private'.  Otago's was 'we don't know how lucky we are because some people live in the slums of Mumbai'.

</p>

<p>How many people were they saying they needed to hire?  1?  They got 3 applicants.  But telling only 3 people that they failed to get the job was not good enough for them.  They need to readvertise and readvertise and readvertise and readvertise and create more and more and more and more desire and demand so they can tell more and more and more and more people that they failed to get the job.  Quite the industry they are creating, there, of people spending all day applying for jobs applying for jobs applying for jobs applying for jobs so that various other people can spend all day readertising jobs and readvertising jobs anad readvertising jobs.  That's what Chris Hipkins wants to do for teaching.  Pay marketers money to advertise teaching as a desirable career.  They want to do that for medicine, too.  Pay actors money to act on Shortland Street apparently to create desire for a career where you can do anything anything anything anything create desire create desire create this situation where you pay some people to tell other people that they can't, they lose, they miss out.  Quite the strategy for, uh, what, exactly?  The how low can we go think lower think lower think lower than lower than low.  Oh yeah.  That's right...  It's got to be plausible and beleiveable that people are *volunteering* to die, in New Zealand.  It isn't that the governmetn is murdering them off when it's time for htem to  be paid.  It's that they are apoptosing all voluntary like.  I guess they want it to seem plausible that we have such high suicide rates.
</p>

<p>I guess the idea is also that people from overseas will see it and, I don't know...  Offer to slip the advertising or marketing people some money or whatever to incentivise and motivate them giving the person the job.  Maybe they will put in a visa application or something to move to New Zealand.  How much does it cost to put in a visa application?  Maybe they will pay for some time in quarantine.  How much will that cost?  Then they will say that the medical was declined or they will come up with some reason why they aren't going to pay you, after all.  Hey.  Maybe they can con you into working the job for maybe 6 months while the payroll system is being worked out...  But then the payments never go through.  Aw.  That was a costly little excursion.  Hey.  Welcome to New Zealand.  Honesty and integrity -- not.    
    </p>

    <p>
Evidence of 'try'?
    </p>

    <p>So there is this article in Nature.  I mean newsroom.  Asking if people would be okay if they learned that their lawyer had not attended classes.   You mean, would people be happy if Jacinda Ardern was on payroll to  be their lawyer and they learned that her Degree was honorary and she hadn't attended classes?  Or do you mean if they learned that so and so's grandson was off skiing or playing golf instead of attending classes but it didn't matter because he was always going to be handed a law degree because of who his granddaddy was?  I mean, it makes a difference -- right?  Oh.  You mean that the law students who are required to work full time while studying (so that their parents and siblings don't have to live out of a laundromat) who would need to commute for 2 hours both ways (in and out of south auckland, for example, or across hamilton city during peak), preferred to study at night (say), from home (say), so that they could actually get through the content.  Those ones.  You want to shame those ones into thinking that they must intrinsically be inferior because they weren't parading themselves up and down the isles of the law library distracting all the other students from their assignments because everybody knew they were going to be judge (hauled out of retirement if need be one day or gifted the degree without even reading the law books) because of who their granddaddy was?  I mean...  Would you rather your lawyer read the law books..  Or would you rather they attended class?  Would you rather they attended the first year mooting competition (where the second year students get to play judge) or would you rather they...  I don't know...  Chose to spend their time trying to attend the actual court proceedings.  Particularly of people who were Queens Counsellors since they were supposed to be shining exmemplars of competence within the legal profession?  They don't want the kids paying attention to the QC's.  They want them doing anything anything anything anything the second year's say because of who their Granddaddy is.  The corruption...  The corruption...  The corruption...  So, lawyers apparently get $150 if their client can be coaxed into signing a confession or admission of guilt.  Okay...  What do the lawyers get if their client does not sign a confession or admission of guilt -- but instead wants for things to proceed to trial?  How much does the lawyer get for everything involved in a trial?  Context.
    </p>

    <p>Squabble squabble squabble squabble squabble.  Things are too corrupt.  I mean, it isn't a matter of public interest that the Univesrities (apparently according to the judges of New Zealand) have unlimited power to give or withhold qualifications as they see fit.  That includes enrolling studnets in programmes they never applied to (collecting money from the government for false billings and keeping false transcripts etc).  I mean...  The idocy.  The blatent f*cking refusal to do any of the most basic of things that they are f*cking well supposed to do.
    </p>

    <p>I mean what is the plan?  I guess the end game here is for things to be pronounced soooooo corrupt in New Zealand that everybody in New Zealand will be imprisoned or incarcerated or kept as slave or whatever for the crime of having been born here.  And then the US or whatever will have to supply us with Harvard Graduates?  Is that the idea?  The NZ governmetn will  be forced to bankroll Harvard Graduates as Lawyers and Doctors and so on because our education system completely and utterly imploded.  Stopped graduating people from certain degrees...  How many years ago, now?  The corruption...
    </p>

    <p>Nothing there.  Nobody home.  Nothing to see. What difference does it make if you read the law books or not?  Judges no speak-y the English.  Must award costs against the person who was wronged.  To punish them for speaking up.  The UN told NZ to restrict the scope of inquiry to abuse in *state* (as in Government) care between certain years of inquiry (not current, present, ongoing) for the purpose of getting the money flowing in the right direction.  From the government to the victims in partial reparation for the crimes against the people that were done by the government.  To get that happening.  To get the judges psychologically used to awarding the costs to the victims in partial reparation for the crimes that were perpeptuated against them.  They were children.  The Government payrolled people to abuse them.  The government and judiciary still will only participate in a process of further harms and further costs against the victims.  To punish them for speaking up.  They just will not do it.  The New Zealadn Government set aside LESS reparation than other nations (USA, Australia, Canada, UK, Ireland etc etc).  AND STILL.  That wasn't enoough (to be the lowest of the lowest of the lowest of the low) instead they STILL Had to aim or act even lower than lower than lower than low.  They are insisting on STILL awarding costs against the victims.  Making the victims pay for the legal fees associated with the inquiry.  Taking the money from the pool that was supposed to be paid to the victims in reparation and.. . Well.  Taking it.  For themselves.  The Judiciary.  Like vultures.  Swooped in to steal from the pot that was supposed to pay the victims in partial reparation for the crimes and wrongs that were done against them by the government of New Zealand including the judiciary.  The judiciary still.  They are refusing to respect the scope of the inquiry.  I mean to say, they keep trying to expand the scope of the inquiry, also.  To the churches, particularly.  The UN was clear about restricting the scope to the government.  So the government would be required to spend governmetn money on reparation to victims.  The government would not be able to say 'wasn't me -- was the church.  Go get money from teh church in reparation'.  The scopeo was to be restricted to the crimes of the government.  Of course the government went about imprisoning the church leaders who did not uphold their ideals of how it was appropriate to treat the children in state care.  What was it that that psychiatrist said in that news show?  Psychiatry is only working with the lowest of the lowest of the lowest of the low.  The real degenerates only.  I guess that is why they bankroll her.  WOuld you want your psychiatrist to be supervised and signed off as okay by a supervisor like her?  New Zealand...  Doesn't work.  hey.  It's not working.  Not working at all.  The flow of money...  Where is Una Jagose?  Where are her pots of gold?  She keeping them in Bitcoin, or what?
    </p>

    <p>Do you want your Medical Doctor to be someone who Dr Leeks chose to sign off on?  Do you want your Medical Doctor to be someone who Dr Leeks chose to support to be registered with the Australasian College of Psychiatry?  I do understand that the Australians are trying to distance themselves from the New Zealand registration to practice medicine people.  But that does not change that they moved Harlene Hayes from Otago to Western Australia so she could pipeline teenagers to the likes of Dr Leeks.  Who Australia chose to hire.  I see some..  80 year old?  GP from NZ has  been found guilty of writing prescriptions when he did not have the authority to write prescriptions for certain (ADHD) medications.  What pharmacy dispenses medications to a registration number that is bogus (insofar as that particular medication is concerned)?  Doesn't make any f*cking sense.  Hey.  Is the guy going to get moved to Brisbane,  now?  To be payrolled over there?  That seems to be the precedent.  I don't see much of any different.  Do you?
    </p>

    <p>So Middlemore will be 'staffed', likely, almost exclusively, by Medical Students who the Universities refuse to sign off on as having completed their training requirements because by refusing to sign them off they get them working while they pay the university they pay the university they pay the university for the cost of their training.  While the University and the hospital both don't payroll anybody to do any teaching or any supervision.  They just collect up all the money so that people on payroll as consultants (who likely never set foot in the hospitals) can bankroll their prostitutes in high rise apartments in Sydney.  Right?  That's why it's soooooo competitive to get to do Medicine.  Everybody wants to make consultant so they can stay away from the hosptials and have whatever hookers they want in apartments in Sydney so they can party party party with all the party party drugs and all the bankroll from the New Zealand Government.  Right?  Ooooooh it's soooooooooo competitive.  Who gets to do Medicine.  Not a matter of public interest, at all.  Hey.
    </p>

    <p>Terrorism laws to be expanded...  So the New Zealand Government can have more and more powers to imprison the likes of Brian Tamaki.  So the police can closely follow and harrass and provoke into attacking yet another person.  Right?  The Government can target individuals and bully them and bully them and bully them to death.  Right?  I mean, it isn't like anybody is any different from Uffindell.  Right?  You do your time of being beaten by the kids a year ahead of you and then you get to have your fun beating the kids the year behind you.  That's our education and training system, right there.  They may as well just herd all the kids into the main auditorium and set it on fire.  I guess that is where things are heading.  Anybody who dares turn up for the graduation ceremony.  I mean, various people on bankroll (who have been for more than 40 years) think they should have for themselves another 40 years +++ of bankroll.  Just send the next generation or two or three off to the death camps.  So you can continue on in the lifestyle to which you have become accostomed.  We don't need any doctors or lawyers or whatever to graduate any time soon.  Justices Gendall and Mander and Toogood have at least another 40 years of payroll in them, each, wouldn't you say?  Dr Leeks is still going strong in Brisbane, no doubt.  And when they do die I'm sure their great great great great great grandchildren can distribute their paychecks from amongst themselves and console themselves that they didn't ever need to work for a living.  I suppose.  Their great ancestors were payrolled enough to keep the whole harem!!
    </p>

    <p>Court tomorrow.  District Court.  Shame.  I thought it was an AV conference hearing.  I was all ready to see about recording the proceedings on my computer and then uploading them to this site so that various people from all around the world could see the District Court Proceedings in New Zealand.  See if it seems possible to do business with New Zealand or whether there isn't anybody home in the Judiciary.  I was looking through all of the filings that have been done in the various High Court Proceedings.  Seeing how much taxpayer money the Governmetn has chosen to give to various firms...  Various firms...  Various firms...  While I provide more and more and more and more slavings.  I know that slaving in the US is tied to keeping records of buying and selling and trading people as property or chattels or whatever.  But what do you call the enrolment records of the slaves in New Zealand Universities?  The ones who work and work and work and work and who pay their employer and pay their employer and pay their employer.  What is it called when you pay your employer and you also work?  Pimping.  Isn't that the term?  The guy who 'looked after' the kids.  Oliver Twist or what have you.  Put them to work going and fetching him money or what have you.  Pimping.  I don't know what you call the slave children doing all of the work paying all of the money to people who...  Well, what does Squiggley do all day?  Have meetings about what Degree to enrol the students in so that it generates maximum billings for the University.  Keeping false enrolment records and refusing to accept work from studnets (demanding they pay more and more and more fees for more and more and more enrolment while providing little to no supervision or training).  What do you call that?  Corruption racket at the very least.  So, anyway...  Looking at all of the filings from various firms...  How much money in billings have I brought the Legal Profession in New Zealand?  Wowsers!!  I am quite the asset for them.  Hey!!! Hey hey!!! Best keep that one oppressed!  Keep her documenting the crimes documenting the crimes.  Hey Hey!!! Let's target her for all the crimes keep bankrolling the major firms.  Oh my, they will have to pull more and more judges out of retirement for all of her filings!! Oh my.  Quite the asset I turn out to be,  hey!! Think how much money you could get from..  I don't know..  Start chopping limbs off and sewing tehm back on only to crop off another one only to...  Wow..  So easy to get bankrolled from the New Zealnd Government.  All and only the brainless f*cking hairbrained need apply!! Of course.  We LIKE to be the slave camp detention centre we LIKE to run this country like a slave camp.  We LIKE to tell our people that they would be lucky to shelter in rubbish bins and if we hadn't have abused Janet Frame so then she never would have made the dreary art that we so love.  QUite the monument to the health system of New Zealand.  That's what we like to see!!!! Immortalising their crimes!!
    </p>

    <p>Apparently some people wrote to the Australasian College to request that they not acknowledge internships from Middlemore because it isn't possible to train students in that environment.  That's the end game, of course.  'Staff' the hospital with studnets and never acknoweldge they have completed their internship at Middlemore.  Of course.  See, they pay the university they pay the university they pay the university and it can be fun to pretend to be a doctor (don't worry, they can't prescribe anything because they aren't registered).  But the patients feel somewhat comforted that someone saw them, pretending to be doctor, and pretended to examine them before saying 'oh there's nothign I can do just go home and get better naturally, like' and we can pat ourselves on the back for having the cheapest health system ever with no doctors on payroll.  Right?  Making money from all of the students paying the university paying the university paying the university to play doctor.  And so.. . There's...  I don't know how many...  People who are registered to practice Meidcine in NZ anad Australia.  They don't want anybody else to be.  They want to be the there is no alternative where they can get millions from the government to be 'independnet consultant' and not step foot in the hospital and so on.  They have no plans to sign off on anybody else's completion of training.  The neurosurgery people wouldn't register the guy who did a neurosurgery residency in New Zealand.  Right?  They weren't going to have him on payroll in Dunedin.  He was to pay them, he was to pay them.  He was to pay them for his 'training' and he pays them for them examining him and saying that he fails and he needs to keep paying them for more and more training.  He pays them.  Until he leaves the country.  Hahahahhahahahahhahahhah there's thousands more from wherever he came from.  Serbia.  Right?  
    </p>

    <p>The quality and integrity of New Zealand University qualifications.  What qualifications?  What training?  What graduates?  What skilled workers?  Nothing to see...  Up and down the land...  Go to the hospital.  Bar the doors.  Set the people on fire.   Nonononononono that's  not how it's done, anymore.  We have a more targeted approach, now.  Get 'em one at a time.  Just pop them off gradually and slowly so it doesn't look like a mass anything at all.  We are supposed to beleive all our skilled graduates left for better jobs overseas.  How plausible is that really?  Put them on a boat, did they, and sink it off the coast of somewhere.  March tehm off into the quarantine facility' and set that on fire?  Any evidence of honesty or integrity at all?  Anywhere...  Anywhere???  Nothing to see, hey.  NOthing nothing nothing at all.  Party party party.  Was academics everything you dreamed it would be?  When I grow up I want to be a Sophist and find people like Socrates and put them promptly to death.  Right.  Well, then.  Check out all the f*cking winners.  Given that game of life. 
    </p>

    <p>I imagine the plan for middlemore is to undermine 1/3 of the Auckland cohort.  Right?  How many University of Auckland studnets are supposed to complete one of their student or training requirements at Middlemore?  But the University is proposing that they won't acknowledge that anybody who has done their internship at Middlemore has actually done their internship.  That means to say you can play doctor as much at Middlemore as you like (so long as you don't use any medical supplies, of course) just so long as you pay the university and pay the university and pay the university and pay.  I think they are doing studies on mould there.  They want to get mould from the houses and the like growing in the lungs and seeding like cancer or tuberculosis.  They will just tell people they have lung cancer and they will die and there isn't anything they can do.  Of course.  Awwwwwwwww there isn't anything we can do.  But they work so hard in killing as many people as young as they can, of course.  They wanted to work towards developing a vaccine for rheumatic fever.  Right?  That means they wanted to withhold the antibiotic treatmetn that is known to be effective so that they could see whether there efforts towards vaccine (or whether providing saline) would result in very very very many more deaths.  Hey, ho, how many people can we be funded to kill or maim today!!! Hey ho!!! We can do anything anything anything anything (just so long as it's psychopathic).  Why else be sooooooooo determined not to process an application to enrol on the basis of it's objective merits.  Wowsers.  The lengths they are willing to go...  I guess the idea/l is you have various people on payroll and they have no intention of leaving anytime in the next 40 years or so.  And they don't really give any kind of a crap at all what happens after they are forced out.  Suicide bomb the whole thing.  They don't care.  All those people registered to practice Medicine in Australasia.  Allllllllll of the money for them.  Why would they want to share by registering anybody else?  You pay them you pay them you pay them you pay them they say if you just keeeeeeep on paying them eventually they will register you and you can be one of them on payroll too.  Yeah, right.  Sure.  Where is the evidence of that, then?  You pay them you pay them you pay them you pay them you pay them you pay them you pay.  I see that.  I see that.  
    </p>

    <p>And they say that Dr Leeks isn't fit to stand trial and then they say that he's dead.  Yeah.  Right.</p>
