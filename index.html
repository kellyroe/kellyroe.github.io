                            <p>I guess the idea...  The ideology...  Is that Australasia has provided no other way of life but for people to ape retarded monkeys.  All the experiments funded by the governments of every nation could not provide evidence in support of anything else.  And neither could the courts.</p>

                                   <p>What is that Sterelny?  You pay only peanuts so you expect for people to behave indistinguishably from monkeys only.  That way you can feel all smug and superior for being behaviourally modern.  It's soooo behaviourally modern to go on and on about how hostile and competitive everything is.  What education and training system?  There isn't anything there.  They won't get the studnets work out for external examination.  Not because they think the externals will fail the students but because they think they will pass them.  They are abusive  bullies.  That is what they are.  Not even trying to be fair at all.</p>

                                   <p>They cry cry cry about how they don't have any money to pay their workers.  But various people are over the age of 65 and they won't get out.  Sterelny isn't supposed to be payrolled anymore he's over the age of 65.  Various judges of the courts of NZ are not supposed to be having more and more and more days in court.  They have had more than 45 years of government payroll for themselves and it's time for them to retire.  The fact that they refused to educate and train the next generation is no excuse for them not to get out.  Get out.  If they won't stand down voluntarily...  They declared war on the younger generation who they will not pay.  They won't do it.  It's time for them to go.  Only over their dead bodies.  They would have things no other way.  They expect the likes of me to curl up and die now that it's time for them to pay me.  F*cking psychopaths.  There's nothing there.  Nobody home.  It got taken over by psychopaths.  That's what Sterelny would say.  It's soooo hostile and it's soooo competitive and everybody is bullied away.  Sterelny is the only game in town.  Who wants to go away camping with Sterelny?  It's soooo important for your career.  It's soooo important for your career to hand over your work to various people already on payroll so they can pass it off as their own.  F*cking psychopaths.  There's nothing there. </p>

                                   <p>It is so funny (strange not haha) how they want to market the Handmaid's Tale (etc) as a situation.  Where children are valued.  No.  Children are not valued.  The mother of children are not valued.  Women are not valued.  It's sooooo hostile.  It's soooo competitive.  They must all be forced to go away on camping trips and hand over their academic work to various travelling because they don't have the willingness or capacity to do the jobs they've been payrolled for.  Let's be honest.</p>

                                   <p>Oooh.  Patrick.  You are the next Daniel Dennet.  (Not).  Oooh Andy.  You are the reason why I wanted to go to MIT. (Not).  It's amazing...  The various graduates they want to ship to Australaia to find wives..  To hand over their academic work all voluntary-like in order to create 'opportunities' for their next generation.  Yeah.  Right.  I guess they forgot to pay me.  Maybe that was what it was.  Their best and their brightest.  Yeah, right.  Is it retired yet?  No more camping trips?  When do I get to talk at conference? Oh.  More and more and more chunks for Sterelny.  Guess nobody was willing to go camping with him voluntarily.  I see why he was so lucrative for the ANU.  Education and training system.  Yeah, right.  Where are all the reports from external examiners?</p>

                                   <p>Did you marry your grad student, Andy?  The one who was writing you a PhD thesis on how women's liberation looks like every male porn fantasy?  I see why they chose to payroll you.  Yeah.  I guess the issue or problem is that nobody is going to pay the University money to go away on camping trips with you.  So... Yeah.  What education and training system?  What University?  There doesn't appear to be anything there.  Hey.  Do all the graduate students pay to go stay in Hotels in NY to go along to the meat market where they will do anything anything anything for an entry level job in Philosophy?  Yeah, right...  I don't suppose the University administration gets to do the anything anything anything they require for payroll.  But, hey, I guess you know how to educate your students into reasonable or realistic expectations for the job market.  Yeah, right.  What education and training system?</p>

                                   <p>Oh.  People are just volunteering to hand over nuclear capability to the Australasian Governments as a kudos for them doing such a wonderful job re: peace and security.  Yeah, right.</p>

                                   <p>Suppose you get a DNA test done.  What reason do you have to believe that they will give you access to your test results?  Really?  What reason do you have to believe?  Suppose you get a cervical smear done.  Suppose you get a colon screen.  A mammogram.  A prostate exam.  What reason do you have to believe that they will give you access to your test results in a timely fashion?  Really.  What reason?</p>

                                   <p>I think it probably is likely that the majority of babies born, in NZ, after a certain year...  Are all fathered by the same guy.  The guy who was the only person they'd payroll to help women with their fertility problems.  Or similar.  Why?  Because that, quite honestly, is the level of intellectual handicap that we are dealing with.  These people (or `people') who need to be quickly quickly expedited into their positions as Medical Students and then Medical Graduates.  Nobody else need apply.  They are the ideal candidate.  Everything it is that we aspire to, as a society.  Right there.  The only game in town.</p>
