 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/130513936/australian-minister-pledges-family-relationship-with-nz-refuses-media-questions  The problem is not 'foreign interference' the problem is how Canberra <em>chooses</em> to conduct itself.  New Zealand is a state of Australia therefore anybody born in the State of New Zealand was in fact born in the Country or Nation of Australia.  It really isn't that hard...  No change to the constitution was made when they decided to pass a bunch of laws to more formerly treat New Zealanders as third class Australians (have them deported with no references and no qualifications etc etc).  It's not f*cking rocket science...</p>

                                <p>Let's start with the Office of the Auditor General.  Let's start there.  How many FTE positions in the Office of the Auditor General.  What's that?  I'm saying about starting the Audit in the Office of the Auditor General. The source of all motivation and inspiration as to how every other Government Department is to keep their books.  Let's start the International Audit right there.</p>

                                <p>https://www.newsroom.co.nz/pro/auditor-general-calls-for-wide-reaching-reviews-of-failing-public-accountability  Well DUh.  Don't need to pay  me half a million dollars per year to tell you that.  What accounts?  I mean to say...  The Universities.. The hospitals...  THe DHB's...  What accounts?  How many FTE positions?  Held  by who?  For how much money are they payrolled for?  Nobody home...</p>

                                <p>The police are spending how much taxpayers dollars to inform people that 16 is the age of consent therefore once they hit 16 their national duty is to accept tha the government has consented them for consentual sexual activity.  That is what it meeeeeeeeans to consent.  Comprehend?  The role of the courts is to punish the victims.  That's right.  The role of the laws is to protect the government when the people try and hold them to account for their crimes.  The role of the judiciary is to imprison people who complain about the government's crimes.  New Zealand is a social engineering experiment in normalising all of this..  They are moving towards the whole pediphilia thing.  I mean...  You take the infants *when they are beign delivered* and take little snips of their cervix then (and at various points ever after) until you claim their uterus entirely in the name of cancer care.  That was a longitudinal study on observing the progression and deaths and having a poke-ity poke poke in the  name of medical research and experimentation and helping me helpling me helpling me help myself to you...  One of the studies that they say is justified because of what we have learned.  We have learned that if you take infants and start poking at their cervix and disrupting the cells (maybe even virus infecting your hands first by playing with diseased rabbit organs) then you can document all the disease and damage that you cause.  Great, hey.  That's a nice job for Ashley's kids!  How about oxygen deprivation studies, then?  We can record how depriving the brain of oxygen at various points (in utero, during birth, on ventillator after birth) can create a whole under-class of people who aren't really people they are never allowed reading writing arithmetic they can just be blow up dolls for Ashley's kids to use and abuse and discard and imprison and kill or whatever they want whenever they want because they want.  Right?  That's the whole aim or the goal or the purpose or the point of New Zealand?  Evidence to the contrary...  Um....  Uh..  Um....  Half a million for the auditor general to audit the books...  How many FTE medical doctors do we have in NZ?  Oh?  How many EFT of enrolment?  WHere does all the money go?  Half a million for the auditor general, was it?  Or did they just implant something in him and if he says otherwise he's been consented to curl up his toes?</p>

                                <p>Everybody slow down!  Nobody is allowed to go faster than Chris Hipkins!  Allll of the portfolios for him.  Everybody slow down...  Get in behind Chris Hipkins...</p>

                                <p>The world did not say that England was guilty of Genocide for the Irish Famine.  So that gives the various governments of the world something to aspire to.  They are talking about 'food upcycling' now, which means they are going to start poisoning the New Zealanders by feeding them 'not export' food.  International standards don't apply to New Zealanders.  Not to the government or anything.  What is the governmetn doing going overseas on 'trade missions'.  What is the job of the government, again?  What are they trading for?  Having a drink to celebrate that we are getting soap to go with the student `nurses' from Vietnam?  Is that the idea?  Party party party in Vietnam.  They are flying about the world on commercial flights.  That documents the cost to the taxpayer of all this government travel that, apparently, could not be done via (for example) Microsoft Rooms.  Nonononono that is no way to go about dodgey backroom dealing.  OF COURSE the President of the United States does not say anything that is not scriped in advance.  What do you want him to do?  Have a quick drink with the Prime Minister of NZ in some back room and thereby be poisoned and accidentally (slip of the tongue) publically declare war on Poland?  FFS.  It is the nasty leaders of nasty despots that get to do anything anything anything they feeeeeeel like with no accountability.  </p>

                                <p>I wonder if Professor Martin Davies of the Australian National University and Oxford University refused to write a reference for any of his other Summer Scholars or any of his Post-Doctoral Fellows etc etc who were put to work on his Australian Research Council Funded Research Projects?  I did work for him on Delusions over a summer.  He did not suggest to me that I apply to the PhD programme and continue on for 3 years getting out a thesis on Delusion.  Rather, he refused to write me a reference for PhD applications.  He refused to write me a reference for the work that I did for him over the summer.  What kind of person does that?  I mean... I did the work for him that I was asked to do for him.  I wrote a paper / a seminar presentation and I read it out (a 40 minute talk) to the department in a departmental seminar slot.  And then he refuses to write me a reference.  What kind of a person does that?  He then went on to write a paper on the motivational (rather than perceptual) aspect of delusion with his wife over in psychology.  That was my idea -- that I got from developing or extensing the work of Sass.  To focus on understandability and motivation rather than focusing on irrationality and gaslighting potential, basically.  Working to dis-credit people in the name of psychiatry.  So Martin Davies ends up going to Oxford (Tim Bayne goes with) and Andy Egan (the post-doc) gets tenure at Rutgers.  And I don't get a reference...  But however many years later Oxford is funding a conference where people other than Professors can talk about delusion.  Except, of course, the Professors will collect up the research funding and the credit, one can only suppose.  I can't find the paper I wrote, now.  I have been locked out of my ANU email account.  The Australian National University will still have access to everything that passed through Professor Martin Davies account, however, and be able to see how he refused to supply me with a reference.  Maybe that was how he got to be promoted to Oxford?  Maybe every single studnet you kill or eliminate the more and more and more and more money and promotions for you?  Is that how it fails to work?  Is he dead yet?  Apparently various people need to die before there will ever be any payment for me for all of the work that I have done.  What's that, Sterelny, first I do the work and then...  And then you kill me.  RIght?  Right about when it's time to pay your worker...  What Philosophy?  What Univesrities?  Slave and detention camps up and down the land...</p>

                                <p>I suppose my best guess would be that Andy's job (as tenured Professor at Rutgers) will be to take the best of the undergraduates work and hand it over to the people at Princeton so the people at Princeton can claim personal credit for it.  Right?  Since Rutgers's (the State Univesrity of New Jersey) would  be a destination place for the best and brightest of New Jersey (due to in-state tuition) and you want to do everything you can to cut people off at the knees that they didn't spend tens or hundreds of thousands on a private school education and / or accept that their only function in life is to play blow up doll to someone who did.  Then you take the best of the work of the public school kids and fail them out and pass their work on to the local private school in the vicinity.  So UNC Chapel Hill will feed Duke and Rutgets will feed Princeton and so on.  I guess that's the idea/l.  And the Australian National Univesrity will take from all of Australasia.  Only it wants to collect up most-est money on studnets needing to pay phenomenal rents to live conveniently in Melbourne or Sydney, I would suppose.  Working busily to undermine anything of any value at all...  Quick quick quickly as they can.  Take the money out quickly quickly quickly and discover...  What?  All the money in the world can't buy anything of any value.  Welll, revise your expectations on what is valuable I suppose.  Party party party.  Who doesn't love a good party.  That's the only reason to go to Univesrity.  Right?  To have morning tea?  To have a yakkity yak so others can take your ideas for themselves?  To meet the best and brightest minds (supposedly) which was why they were employed at the best Univesrities?  Right??  No??  Why were they employed by the 'best Univesrities' again?  Tell me over drinks, will you?  Party party party?  Orientation week is why we go to Univesrity, right Harlene?  </p>

                                <p>I put in an Official Information Act Request to know how much money the University of Auckland has chosen to spent on External Counsel to try and have the courts of New Zealand pronounce or proclaim that the University is entitled to enrol or not enrol any student in any programme of study that they want (irrepective of what the studnet has applied to, irrespective of any selection algorithm published for the purpose of accountability).  On the one hand, maybe they spent tens or even hundreds of thousands trying to have the courts declare that they can throw away applications in order to prioritise wrongful deathbringing sexual violators of the university administrations selfish genes only.  On the other hand, maybe the only lawyers the University will acknowledge as graduates will work for the university pro bono to establish the same.  I mean to say, maybe they paid external counsel nothing.  I could see it going either way.  Interesting...  to the public.  I would have thought.  What is it we say, Dean's of Medicine?  Soooooo motivating and inspiring.  Yeeeeeeees.  That's why people want to do Medicine.  Because of you.  Not at all in spite of you.  Despite you.  I think they have to die before other people can do it for the other reasons that other people have...  Party party party with Des Gorman, anybody???  ANyway...  The point is that the Office of the Ombudsman delayed things so that now, one year later, the University is saying they will make the information privately available to me if I agree not to share it with third parties.  But how would that help New Zealand?  How would that help you decide if you want to enrol in Law or Medicien with Auckland in spite of or despite or perhaps even because of the Unviesrity Administration and the wonderful choices they make to be such an esteemed and respected insitution of higher learning and education...  Or whether it's about expediating things for the likes of Ashley Bloomfields kids so they can go on and murder and rape and anything anything anyting with impunity.  How much does that cost the people of NZ?  Really...  Just how costly is Auckland's decision to refuse to process applications according to the criterion that they published for the purposes of accountabiltiy.  What accountability?  </p>

                                <p>The Education and Training Act states that teenagers (under 20) are only to be enrolled if the Council belives they have the capacity to complete the programme.  AUT is failing most of their nursing cohort.  Under 20's.  All being set up to fail to receive their qualifications in the time it is supposed to take to complete the qualifictions.  How are they managing to commit this atrocity?  They starve them... Force them to take up part time work while they are full time studying and of course their full time study involved them working full time as nurses (if nursing is about 'getting in there and having a go') and they will re-enrol and re-enrol and re-enrol and re-enrol them so they pay more and more and more fees to the Unversity and the Government will not pay them.  Re-enrol and re-enrol and re-enrol and re-enrol and will not give them the qualiflictions and will not pay them.  There is no education and traiining system.  Series of abuse in state care detention camps and facilities up and down the land.  The judges appear to lack the most basic capacity to read the laws (as they are written).  Nobody home.</p>

                                <p>This website documents how Australasia does not have an Education and Training System.  Rather, they keep a series or system of detention or prison or slave camps up and down the land.  It is sooooo competitive that some people are paid by the government to hold hostages or to keep slaves while other people are to be kept detained indefinately with no credit for the work they have done while their work is not sent out to external examiners else it is sent out for examination for the wrong degree.  Apparently I need to wait for the older generation to die  before there will be a job for me.  Once they have received all the research and teaching money they believe they are entitled to then there is nothing left for me, you see.
                                </p>

                                <p>New Zealand appears to be some kind of Medical or Scientific Experiment (or Observational Study) in oppression.  I mean to say that New Zealand is refusing to train people in Medicine and refusing to fund Medical or Science (or even Philosophy or Social Science or even Arts) research, often, because (by the seems of it) they don't wnat to do anything to undermine the wrongful deathbrining.  THey are refusing to process applications to Medicine on the basis of the published criterion they have on how the applications will be processed.  Rather, the Universities (in both NZ and Australia) believe they have unlimited discretion to enrol (or not enrol) studnets for whatever arbitrary reasons they have.  They have chosen to use positions to preferentially enrol the children of certain high profile people.  Mostly (best I can figure) on political grounds.  For example, hiring children of research scientists so the children are, effectively, put to work collecting up samples for their parents science research (rather than doing clinical medicine in the service of the patients interests).  For example, working only to keep certain segments of society unhealthy and oppressed (e.g., by blaming the victim for problems arising from the governemnt choosing to keep them in oppressive environments -- particularly in state or government custody or 'care').  The Universities believe they have power to fail students for arbitrary or no good reason and also power to grant or confer qualfications on an honorary basis only (e.g., to people who did none of the work for them and who met no requirements for them).  They believe they have the power to rescind qualifications after they have  been awarded and so on. </p>

                                <p>Australasia cannot rightly claim to be part of the free and developed world. Look at how they choose to keep so many of their people.  They refuse to get students work to externl examiners so as to hold them hostage.  The Government is the major employer (private law firms, for example, seem to subsist on all the work the government gives them to defend the atrocities of the government) and they won't even process applications for employment.  THey won't even employ people.  They are keeping hostages.  They are killing people.  It does not matter what any of the laws are (it does not matter what teh Australian constitution says at all) because the Judiciary refuses to uphold the law.  Recently NZ appointed a whole bunch of retired High Court Judges back into office (rather than appointing new judges) so they could write that they don't see anything wrong.  E.g., with the unexplained death of Mason Pendrous.  E.g., with the Universities of NZ enrolling studnets in whatever they wanted (even if that means double and triple billing, even if that means invoicing student loans for courses the student never applied to be enrolled in) and also refusing to get theses out for external examination.  Australasian Universities do not get students work out to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit interntional community from signing off on the students qualification.  Qualifications from Australasian universities can't mean anything because of all the false negatives (not giving students qualifications when they have done their work) and who knows how many false positives (giving the children of the administration theses they have taken from other studnets who were bullied into fleeing with no credit).  There's nothing there...
                                </p>

                                <p>All these people who grubbity grub grubed their way into lucrative government jobs by the age of 25.  40 years later they don't want to walk away from their salaries.  It isn't like they actually do any work.  They can just tell their slaves to house sit for them and hand their work over to them so they can claim it for themselves or give it to their own children or give it to people who (they believe) will  never  be able to function independently of them.  They can stay on payroll and however many younger people can be shipped off to die overseas, that's a good idea.  Right?  Send off however many generations to be exterminated while continually cry cry cry cry crying about how the problem is that there aren't enough people, there aren't enough skilled people, one will have to just keep on collecting up allllllll of the money for oneself there aren't enough people, there aren't enough people, there aren't enough people.  The people need to go off to die, now, because the problem is that there aren't enough people to do all of the work for none of the pay and none of the credit and then they die, and then there needs to be new people to do all of the work for none of the pay and none of the credit and then we need to manufacture a war for them to go off and die in..  Or maybe a psychiatric facility where they can be detained in the name of their mental health...  Or maybe an 'education and training institution' where they can do all of the work for none of the pay and none of the credit.  When it is time to pay tehm / credit them / acknowledge them.  Well...  Over the dead bodies of their supervisors and the university administration.  Right?  Carefully handpicked for being most psychopathic.</p>

                                <p>How many Medical Students did Dr Leeks refuse to graduate / fail out of the Medical Training Programme / refuse to endorce for Psychiatry training or registration on the grounds that...  They had a problem with him trying to teach childrent to sexually respond to (enjoy and be happy) being sexually abused by the various adults whom he chose to pimp them out to?  How many not psychopaths needed to die or give up their lives so that he could do his 'good works' (to then be awarded or rewarded by re-deployment to Melbourne)?  There's nothing there..  In Australasia, I mean. The leaders here choose to keep the population here as a prison camp or detention facility for all the criminal offenders of the world.  So far as I can see...</p>

                                <p>The University of Auckland still has to explain to the people how the hell someone managed to forge for himself a working student identification number, barcode on his identification card, and name that matched the roll, such that he was able to swipe himself into and work with a group in cadavar laboratory.  Apparently he was able to forge his way into the 'limited entry' course where enrolment numbers were limited because of the maximum number of groups and maximum number of students in each group.  But the math wasn't good enough to know that one of the groups had one more student than all of the other groups.  We are supposed to believe that he...  I don't know...  Hypnotised or drugged the entire cohort and the instructors into not noticing that there was one extra person in the class.  The University of Auckland still has to explain to the people how it is that that very same person then managed to forge for himself a working identification card and so on that had him employed and on payroll in the Middle hospital system of New Zealand.  How does that happen?  Corruption.  That is how it happens.  Why is the University of Auckland refusing to acknowledge him?  Was it time for them to pay him?  That means it was time for him to go away into prison, now.  They would rather imprison him than pay him?  Is that the idea?  I suppose there would be University of Auckland studnet records pertaining to his enrolment.  I don't see how else he would have his photograph and student identifiction number etc etc listed on the roll for the laboratories that he attended.  It is disingenous to expect the people to believe that he forged himself a working student identification number and name and barcode and swipe acces.  It is in-credible.   Not credible.  Not credible, at all.  F*cking corruption.  How much do you have to pay to rape people under anasthetic?  How much do you have to pay to remove organs?  Or does the government pay you to commit atrocities (and only to commit atrocities?).</p>

                                <p>Now New Zealand is being all 'meeee toooo' with the prison and detention camps of China.  New Zealand wants the world to believe that it is justified in putting 10 - 14 year old kids (often ones who were abused in state care and failed out of school quite irrespective of their academic ability or their knowledge because once certain people's children had to have all the acknowledgement and all the credit there simpliy wasn't enough room in the world for these other kids to have their examination scripts forwarded to external examiners to be examined on their academic merits.  Rather, the Government wants to indoctroniate these children into working (for no pay, 'volunteering' they call the non-voluntary 'training') the jobs that they refuse to pay people to work.  Picking fruit and construction, usually.  They will not pay people to do it, they will not abide by the basic health and safety regulations, they are wanting to force children to 'work' those jobs for no pay, now.  This is the brilliant idea of what to do with the kids.  Reading and writing and arithmetic is not for those kids.  Next the New Zealand Government will be wanting to draft them to go off and die in the Ukraine.  The lengths they will go to so that their own special children can go on wrongful deathbrining and offending against other people's children...  The prevention and prohibition of social development, indeed.  The great experiment in social engineering that is New Zealand.   </p>

                                <p>Nice to see our  best surigcal practices are being rolled out in the civil aviation industry.  Not sure how many heads in the plane.  Lol.  But yeah, that one can board because the face looks kinds sorta like the person on the roll for the plane.  Yeah, right.  Maybe the kid of the politician wants to hang out in the flight deck and play at flying a plane?  Well, then, it isn't like NZ has an education and training system, at all.  All the honorary qualifications in flying planes to be handed to whomever the government wants on political grounds. </p>

                                <p>So, after forcing people to get vaccinated (being very heavy handed with mandates and even removing people from government jobs if they refused to get vaccinated) now the government is withholding boosters from most people.  See..  The actual policies (whether in accord with best international practice or not) are really irrelevant to the forcing of the governments will on everybody else.  The government thinks that they are very very clever and they get to decide what is right for everybody.  It is like God talks to Jacinda and Jacinda rolls it out for all the people.  If you don't like what was rolled out then send her gestures of good will like honorary degrees, maybe, and then I guess she can use her discretion to get things happening that wouldn't happen otherwise.  Smooth a pathwy for people from the US to come to NZ and make 'designer' or 'knock out' babies.  A land where they can't be prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus (murder).  Not that anybody ever has been prosecuted for that in a land that values it's children as the garbage of the world only.  I mean, the value of a child in NZ is lower than the value of a child everywhere else.  That's what it means to have such high rates of wrongful death and abuse and so on. Mostly at the hands of the state, of course.  They are doing experiments in oxyggen deprivation, particularly.  They want to breed a whole under-class of 'people' who can work the jobs that nobody else wants where the government can say somewhat credibly that the people lack the capacity to do things like higher reason or read or write or whatever.  Trying to breed homo sapiens to be slaves.  That seems to be the ideology behind New Zealand.  Our leaders seem to embrace it.  That's the worst of it, really.  HOw much our leaders seem to really get into the spirit of it.  All the work that they do so that their own children can have high up positions where they get to abuse and undermine others.  They will not have things any other way.  The detention camp of the world.  That is how our leaders lead.  They talk to the people like the people are imbeciles because they honestly beleive that they are. </p>

                                <p>I mean...  How many years can it possibly take to complete a 1 year research project?  People can't tell the difference between 'I like what you say' or 'I agree with what you say' and 'your work has academic merit'.  They make snap quick judgments on the basis of irrelevant factors (claiming that they were overwhelmed by all the work they insisted on having control of themselves and not allowing anybody else to do anything or have any input) and the decisiosn are made on the worst of the reasons (all of the cognitive bias and so on stuff) and then they are committted to what they have decided and will not back down.  It is like the parents who snap 'no' when they are feeling overwhelmed so the kids learn not to ask when their parents are flustered.  Except the governmetn is always flustered because emergency after emergency after emergency after emergency so that they can rush through a lot of laws that never would have been made into law otherwise.  And then it turns out that they overspent their campaign budget because they knew that they never would have been democratically elected if they hadn't have overspent the campaign budget.  What more evidence of an illitigimate government that is working only to undermine and sell out the people could there possibly be?  What a f*cking farce of a farce-land.</p>

                                <p>The list of jobs they say they need people to work in..   They won't sign off on qualification completions for people to do thos, in NZ.  The Universities hold them as hostages only.  Like they won't sign off on completed nurses qualifications. Why would they when they can 'reprogram' a 10 year old to pretending to work that job for free.  Why would they do that when they can smiply not pay people to pass themselves off as working that job for free?  If they don't like it they can imprison them, then.  Wrongful death them.  New zealand does not prosecute.  Either they don't enrol or graduate or employ lawyers to do that else they will only graduate police (etc) who agree to pretend to not know that they are only working to undermine the chain of evidence etc so that the evidence is not admissible in court etc.  So there aren't any proper prosecutions in NZ because nobody can do their f*cking job.  Because they won't train anybody.  They won't graduate anybody.  THey won't publically advertise the jobs.  They won't employ people to work the job.  They won't pay the workers.  They won't pay the workers.  They won't pay the workers.  Slave and detention camps of wrongful deathbringing up and down the land...  Warmongering the Ukraine in the hope they can send 10 year old children off to their deaths because there isnt' enoguh room in teh schools once the chidlren of the government workers have taken up their rightful places as prison guards for the next generation.</p>

                                <p>I remember NZ used to think that it was proud to stand up for and root for the underdog.  No more.  That's not the situation here, at all.  When they aren't trumpeting on and on and on about being the best being the best being the best they are laughing in the faces of the losers.  That is the kiwi way actually.  Have the courts paied compensation for the victims of abuse in state care, yet?  So that they victims can purchase treatment if they want?  No mount of money will purchse them treatment in NZ, no doubt, because tehre is nothing here.  Not a functioing public sector and no private.  ANd of course NZ won't pay the victims won't compensate the victims.  Hahaha they lose.  What is so hard to udnerstand? T here is no justice in NZ.  There is no fairness.  The governmetn is illitigmate and the judiciary fails to function.  The judges are not even appointed by the process that was published as to how they were to be appointed.  Kuru.  It must be the kuru, aye?  The state of something going very very very very very wrong with the thinking...  Half a million for Ashley.  Half a million for Una.  Quarter of a Million for Whelan.  Half a million for the VC of University of Auckland to keep hostages.  More than a quarter for the VC of Waikato to keep hostages.  Tens of thousands to private firms to defend their entitltement to keep hostages. Cry cry cry cry cry there is no money left to pay doctors nurses teachers we will have to wrongful death all thep eople because there' sno money left.  Once we've paid the high ups to keep hostages...  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>The courts won't progress my filings.  And now, apparently, academics are going to be cluttering up the courts with work requesting 'declarations' on the legality of various things -- like they are not capable of reading the statements of the law for themselves.  It doesn't matter what the laws are, teh judges refuset o uphold the laws.  It doesnt' matter what the laws are, the judges are not appointed by proper process and they will not remove them when they demonstrate that they are unwilling and / or unable to do their job.  </p>

                                <p>New Zealand does not appear to have a functioning health system, education system, judiciary.  There' snothing here.  Australia does not seem to be doing any better.  Thats the only sense I can make, really, of why they are happy to take such 'high value' people as Sterelny, Hayes, Leeks, and my former landlord, and create for them opportunitites to roll out the prevention and prohhibition of develoopment disestablishment programme.  Party party party party party at the ANU.  Who wants to party with the kids of the administration?  Is that fun for you?  Maybe you could do all their work for them, too, and they can take your work and give it to someone else so they can have credit for it (Penn, now?  Is it?)  Else redact the bits they don't like (that make themselves feel uncomfortable) and pay others to writewash it.  I do find it strange, given the political input, then, that the governments wanted to hear a story about how the god of modern society is Dawkins selfish genes.  It's inevitable.  Of course.  That way nobody can or will be held to account.  Bart must be the safety inspector of the powerplant, of course, because Homer refused to allow or acknowedege the training of anybody else.  For the good of..  Uh...  Yeah.  Well done.  Good job!  ALLLLL of the everything for you!!! </p>

                                <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/478921/sentencing-discounts-benefit-offenders-while-punishing-victims-advocate-says  The injustice system that works only to compound the wrongs.  Let's be clear.  Let's be clear about that.  That is or means to say New Zealand lacks a Justice system.  The experiment in social engineering (the prevention and prohibition of society) involves punishing people for speaking up about wrongs.  Giving degrees to people who did not do the work for them.  Withholding degrees from people who did do the work for them and so on.  Upside down and back to front land.  Destination for all the violent offenders of the world.  Brought to you by the wrongfully elected officials who have no claim to their payrolls who can't even follow the process for passing laws that the judiciary never will uphold anyay.  Sad day for people who actually invested time nd energy and effort in what they thought was a judicary, hey.  There doesn't appear to be anything here...  </p>

                                <p>So now we seem to have finished blowing up bus drivers with the payment things that were installed in the front of the buses in Auckland.  Moved on to blowing up flight decks of planes?  I suppose you could have a system where if the flight deck people refuse to follow the flight safety plan checkilist thing then they are not cleared to fly...  The cheapest and easiest and most efficient way of dealing with it is to simply blow up the flight deck, I would suppose.  They could make them like detachable caps and eliminate the flight crew while being able to fly the plan from air traffic control on the ground.  Of course.  I mean, nobody in their right mind would actually allow New Zealand to take control of who gets to fly a plane in developed lands.  Right?  Or Australia for that matter, no doubt.  You could simply have an electronic kill switch in the OR.  Maybe.  For when there appears to be somene who forged himself a registration number and identification card and building swipe and forged himself onto the name list of who was supposed to be present in the OR and, I don't know, arranged for whoever was supposed to be scheduled in to be wrongfully deathed so that there was enough room in the OR for the imposter..  Nothing to see here, people.  NOthing nothing nothing at all.  THey can't forward a thesis submitted for external examination out to an external examiner.  Keeping hostages only.  There is nothing here.  Half a million for Ashley, Half a million for Una...  All the titles for Jacinda...  WHo surely did not overspend in the election campaign..  Yeah, right...</p>

                                <p>I wonder if they microchip people.  I don't see why they wouldn't.  I would think that the most likely scenario would be microchipping people when they remove wisdom teeth.  THey could plop a little chip in and the bone will grow over.  Would be quite the rigamarole to have it removed from the jawbone once it's been implanted in there.  I don't know about the feasibility of wiring up people so that you could explode them if they aren't sufficiently doing what you say when you say because you say.  I guess that's the thing about artificial pacemakers or brain inplants.  Probably the heart, mostly.  The ability to remotely disrupt or cease pumping so that the person dies.  That way...  Tell them once, tell them twice, no need to tell them three times.  Salute.  Thanks for your service.  No people...  NOthing to see, here...  NOthing nothing nothing at all.  HOw hard can it possibly be to process an applicaiton according to the criterion that was published for the purposes of accountability?  Oh, there is no accountability.  Not the developed world at all.  NOthing nothing nothing at all.  Who wants to come to NZ?  CHeapest babies in the world.  Come, buy a baby!  Borrow a baby!  Rent a baby so you can do what you want for a while..  With no accountabiltiy at all.  What accountability?  Nothing to see here people, nothing nothing nothing at all.</p>
