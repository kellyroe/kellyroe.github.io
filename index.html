    <p>The Australian Constitution says that New Zealand is a state of Australia.  But the Constitution of Australia does not apply to Australia.  They don't have to supply voting papers etc to New Zealanders.  The New Zealand Education and Training Act says that domestic adults are elgiible to be enrolled in programmes they have applied to.  But the laws don't apply to the Universities of New Zealand.  They refuse to supply applications to domestic adults.  They refuse to process applications from domestic adults.  They prevent and prohibit them applying and throw their applications way so as to fill up training programmes for things like Medicine and Law with teenagers.  There's really nothing in these garbage heap of waste lands..  They won't get work out to external examiners.  There's nothing more than a buch of bullies throwing their weight around.  Nobody home.  Nothing here.  THey refuse to get graduate student work to external examiners.  They bully and abuse.  THey refuse to get graduate student work to external examiners.  WHere is the evidence that they offered supervision to me?  There should be emails of meetings etc.  Where is the evidence that they offered supervision to me?  Oh, I'm just to slave and slave and slave and slave and slave and slave and nobody will pay me until they're all dead.  F*cking great.  Thanks a f*cking lot.  Theres nothing here.  There aren't any universities.  Slave camps.  They give honorary qualifiations only to the inbred children of the administration.  Nothing here.  Nobody home.  Dr Leeks: Most highly valued employee of the year.  Only applicant they didn't throw away.  What a f*cking farce of a f*cking joke.  Psychopaths.  Prison camp detention lands.  That's how the leaders of these parts view themselves and their role and their job.  That's how they treat their people.  F*cking psychopaths.
