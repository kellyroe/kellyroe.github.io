                              <a href="./writing/ks.png">Email from Kim Sterelny</a>.  Just so we are clear...  When I was in Australia enrolled in the PhD programme I gave him a draft of a thesis document more than 100,000 words in length.  He never gave me written or verbal feedback comments on the work that I gave him.  Instead, we have this meeting about me moving back to NZ.  So I move back to NZ and keep sending him work.  I'm thinking about what was happening around the time when he emailed me this.  Was this when John Matthewson was having work on functions published and credited to John Matthewson?  Prior to that Fiona MacPhearson was taking my seminars on delusions (she was given copies of handouts that I distributed at conferences and workshops) and getting that published -- without crediting me at all.   </p>

                              <p>The whole time I was at the ANU I never saw anybody defend their doctoral thesis publically.  I never saw anybody get reports from external examiners.  I never went to a graduation.  Did anybody have their work properly processed?  Did anybody actually graduate?  Various people are payrolled for apparently or allegedly having doctoral theses -- but I don't know how they were credited with them in fact.</p>

                              <p>What is Sterelny still doing on payroll?  He's over the age of 65.  Well over.  I thought there was compulsory retirement at the age of 65 so that others can have a life.  So it's not like that episode of Shameless where we have these vegetables kept in aged care institutions so that the likes of Frank can divert their wages into back accounts of their own.  He doesn't have a harem to keep anymore so where the hell does all his money go?  All the research funding for all the research grants.  All the payroll he gets from teh ANU for his tenured position.  Does he do any teaching?  When he was supposed to be supervising me he had only a small handful of students to supervise.  He certainly did not supervise me at all.  He's a f*cking bully is all he is.  A f*cking bully who puffs out his chest and goes on and f*cking on about how f*cking selfish he is and how the world  has been taken over by psychopaths.  Indeed.</p>
