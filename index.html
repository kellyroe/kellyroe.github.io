                                <p>The Australian National University and Bad Faith.

I applied for and obtained a Summer Research Scholarship with the Australian National University.

During my time there I worked on an Australian Research Council Funded Project on Delusions that Professor Martin Davies had obtained funding for.  The topic was his and he gave me a couple special editions of a Journal for me to base my research on.  We had weekly meetings and the scholarship culminated in my writing a talk which I read the department in a seminar slot.

He said my talk was 'as good as anything else that has been done, here' and then declined to write me a reference for US PhD applications.  He said he would put a good word in for me at the Australian National University, however.

That is to say the Australian National University had months over that summer to assess for themselves the quality of my work before deciding whether or not to fund me for a PhD.  They chose to fund me for a PhD but would not support my applications to study in the US.

Professor Martin Davies then left the University to take up a Professorship at Oxford.  I wanted to develop or extend the work on Delusions so it would be broader about Psychiatry, more generally, as a Branch of Medicine that was grounded in Natural Science.

It was suggested that Professor Kim Sterlny would be the supervisor who was the best-fit for that kind of project.  I don't believe that I had any supervision meetings up until my 6 monthly review that was delivered after 1 year of enrolment.

The night before I was scheduled to give my 6 monthly review he asked to see my work and then proceeded to attempt to bully me out of giving a talk at all.  He said it wasn't up to standard and it was of the wrong format.  

I have asked the Australian National University to supply me with my studnet record file notes which should have comments from my supervisor about our supervision meetings (including the frequency of them) and about how I was progressing up until my 6 monthly review.

The Australian National University has declined to acknowledge my request for information.  They simply won't reply to my emails requesting information about how it is that they received so much Government money for my enrolment over so many years while refusing to acknowledge any progression towards my obtaining the qualification they had me enrolled in.

My progress was deemed sufficient enough for me to be offered a Vice Chancellor's travel Award so that I could pause my PhD enrolment with the ANU to spend 1 year at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, a 'Public Ivy' School in the USA.  I suppose the ANU wouldn't have nominated me or allowed me to go there or funded me to go there if they thought that I was a terrible or incompetent or lazy student.

I was not allowed to give my mid-term review prior to leaving for North Carolina.  On my return I met with my supervisor the night before I was due to give my mid-term review, again, and he attempted to bully me out of it being my mid-term.

I have asked the Australian National University to provide me with what information they have about when I gave my mid-term review and about what my supervisor had to say about my progress and about what supervision meetings I had and about what if any kinds of warnings I had been given about lack of progress, what reasons I was given for them refusing to acknowledge my work etc.  They are not responding to my emails.

During the question time for my mid-term my supervisor was the biggest critic.  Most of the other faculty asked a few polite questions but my supervisor attemtped to shred everything apart.  It was customary for the supervisor to spend time at Fellows and go to dinner with the studnets after one of their students gave a talk or completed a milestone.  The only faculty who turned up to fellows was Jonathan Schaffer.  He said he had just spent the last hour or so (in a faculty meeting I wasn't invited to) trying to convice Kim that my talk 'wasn't that bad'.

I don't believe there were any more supervision meetings.  

Apparently people passed a tin around to fund-raise money so that I could take an air-plane back to New Zealand after my scholarship funding ran out.

I think there is enough reason and evidence to believe that the Australian National University (and / or the Philosophy Programme) acted in bad faith in their dealings and interactions with me.  

They have since ceased the Summer Research Scholarship Programme.  I think the likely reason for that is so that they don't have to face the conflicting evidence of how well they regarded their Summer Scholar to be performing so as to give them PhD Scholarship offer of place before they then go on to write that they are underperforming which is why they weren't allowed to complete any of their thesis milestones.

Why would the Australian National University generally and my former Supervisor more particularly want to treat me so badly?

I suppose it is because of the 'competitive funding' environment.  My Supervisor gets large grants to do research projects and if he wants to keep getting the grants for the research projects then I suppose he doesn't want anybody with the capacity to work independently from him to be seen to exist, at all.

I suppose other studnets thought their job was to spend their time chasing him begging for meetings and having him play a considerably more hands-on role in the writing of their thesis such that he couldn't really object to anything that he had said himself.  That is to say they were supposed to demonstate to him that they were willing or able to pass his work off as their own and they were not interested in workind independently from anything he may choose to give them.

New Zealand Universities seem to think their job or function or role is to follow behind Australian Universities.  The way in which the Australian National University chooses to treat it's studnets (or chooses to allow it's studnets to be treated) becomes an aspirational ideal for New Zealand Universities.

The Univesrity of Auckland informed me that it didn't matter about my Australian PhD (whether I was acknowledged as having completed it or not) because they wanted me to have completed a qualification from a NZ University within the last 5 years in the 'minimum, normal, or standard time' in order for them to process my application to Medicine.

I think there is good reason to think that the Univesrity of Auckland was   acting in bad faith.  They only said that because they believed that they could always bully me out of completing on time, else, if I insisted on submitting a thesis in time for external examiners to sign me off, then they could simply refuse to get my work to external examiners and prevent and prohibit my timely completion in that way.  The University of Auckland doesn't even show it's own studnets the reports from external examiners.  That is to say, there is nothing to stop the University of Auckland from telling it's own studnets that the externals wanted to fail them even if the externals said they wanted to see them graduate in a timely fashion.

The aim or point or purpose or goal appears to be that students pay more and more and more and more fees for enrolment and re-enrolment and re-re-enrolment, and re-re-re-enrolment in order to fund the lifestyle choices of the university academics and administators and managers that there are so that they can travel around the world staying in expensive hotels partying with undergraduate and graduate studnets who will do anyting anything anything at all to be one of them.  

The aim or point or purpose or goal appears to be that studnets hand over or supply to the university more and more and more work in the form of seminars or writing.  And then the studnet is bulled out or away or outright failed such that others can then claim for themselves those ideas ideas or that written work.

Since the University of Auckland instructed me to complete a new qualification from NZ I chose to enrol in Waikato because they were clear in their regulations that the outcome of examination is to be based in 'reports of external examiners' rather than something that is to be decided in-house by people who are in the position to profit from keeping their student-slave as a student-slave doing all of the work while simultaneously handing over more and more and more fees to the University.

The University of Waikato then simply refused to get my work to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit them signing off that the work was complete.  The University of Waikato also sent my masters thesis out with instructions for it to be externally examined for the wrong degree so that the external examiners would be forced to say that it wasn't up to the standard required for the degree the University asked them to examine the thesis for.  The University of Waikato believed that so long as there existed a typographical error or request for one more reference or a request that a comma be added or a sentence rearranged then the thesis was 'not acceptable in it's present form' which meant they had discretion to say that it had failed.

All this is done so that a few academics and a lot of administrators and mangers can live in a manner to which they have become accostomed where there lifestyle is funded by students paying the univesrity and handing over to the university the fruits of their labor.  In return for this the University refuses to allow them to complete qualifications, refuses to acknowledge they have completed qualifications, refuses to acknowledge that they enrolled the studnet at all.

They are not dealing with studnets in good faith.

It is not possible to do business in the juridiction.



Bad Faith:  The Courts of New Zealand


The major law firms of New Zealand do not comply with minimum wage laws for the number of hours (including overtime) they expect their employees to work.

Why don't the junior lawyers sue the firms, then?

One option is that the firms refused to hire lawyers with the capacity to take cases to court.

Another option is that the lawyers know that the courts will only find against them (the victims), further victimising them if they choose to speakup.


Why won't NZ extradite kim.com?


People in the US have done a lot of work to put the prosecution together and they want kim.com to stand trial in the US for megauploads.

The courts of NZ are allowing him to file and re-file and re-re-file and -re-re-re-file and have case managment conference after case management conference after case managaement conference to delay and obstruct and prevent and prohibit him from being required to attend a trial in the USA.

He pays the courts, he pays the courts, he pays the courts, he pays the courts.  And in exchange for him paying the courts of New Zealand they find all kinds of obscure things to wax on about.

Why?

Why won't the judges of New Zealand co-operate with US officials so as to allow US judges to decide upon megauploads.

I would imagine the likely best answer to this is that it isn't about copyrighted music or movies intellectul property as it is about glorious film footage of New Zealand judges, likely, and perhaps other figures, engaging in pedophile parties and so on.  The idea being that the US judges won't think anything of these things being accepted in as evidence whereas the NZ judges can work with kim.com so that maybe he doesn't actually have to pay the NZ courts anything at all.

I can't think why else they would refuse to extradite a person to stand trial in the US. 

The High Court Judgements that I have had, it seems to me, were all in bad faith.  Justice was not obtained.  I suppose the reason for this, again, is to support their lifestyle choices.  The law interns, etc.  

I suppose they read the slavery manifesto of Wellington-Wells which is now the Canberra Think-Tank of how it is the happy few can protect all the things they think that they have.  Until they get sick, of course.  And the entry level 'jobs' for medicine, well, they are soooooooooo competitive.

So Ashley Bloomfield got paid around $500,000 per year to appear on television every day and motivate and inspire a new generation to study Medicine and take up a clinical training place so they could get rich as public servant.  He was in the position for 4 years, so that's 2 million dollars of taxpayers money because he is worth so very much more than the average New Zealander.  He gives a new generation a new motivation, however, previously they only had Chris Warner as a motivation to become chief of the administration with a Medical Degree.  Control over the government contracts for the competitive funding on who will supply medical equipment that will be written up as expired and thrown away.

I wonder what Ashley Bloomfield's sons are up to now.  If he spent his 2 million on getting them full fee paying places at Harvard or if they were whittled away to Western Australia for the immediate entry to Medicine programme headed by Harlene Hayes so they can ship the children of the officials up to do 'cervical examinations' on non-consenting Aboriginal populations (primarily, but not solely).   I had heard that spending time in prison for a crime you did not commit was a requirement to become a patched member of the Mongrel Mob.  It seems that performing an internal examination on a person who did not consent for one to be performed is a requirement of being signed off as having completed the requirements of a Medical Degree.  I suppose the footage of what goes on in the Operating Theatres of New Zealand and Australia is kept on a site like megauploads.  Likely footage of what goes on in residential halls at boarding schools up and down the country.  Etc.

Apparently the thing of it is to give Crimson Education a bunch of money and they may choose to give you some of the answers to the questions or give you some of the questions.  They asked me specifically how I felt about this in one of my Medical School Interviewers.  The lady interviewing me appeared to have conscience sufficient to display mild embarrassment at the boy 'actor' hand-picked for his willingness to have paid them most-est, over the years, one can only suppose.  

All about the children.  Sure.  Sex crimes are not about sex, they are about power.  All about display of power.  Sure.  It doesn't make any sense to think that a health system, education system, judiciary could be found when people are only interested in using and abusing the children.  I think Jacinda Ardern said something about the aspirational goal of New Zealand being the 'best place in the world in which to be a child'.  Forever.  One can only suppose.  All the money they put people being conceived in alcohol, born into conditions of oxygen deprivation, being beaten around the head in the name of national sport without helmets etc.  Everything everything everything we can to create people as trainable and compliant as the animals and intellectually handicapped, mentally ill and prisoners, all the research done on behavioral compliance back in the 1960's and 1980's.  

Otherwise you hold people in conditions of torture.  Observation checks every 15 minutes to ensure people don't get to sleep.   Keeping people in rooms with no natural light or regular routine so they can't tell if hours or days or months or years or decated have passed.   Keeping people in conditions of torture in the 'hospitals'.  That's the 'health system', folks.  Pay them money, pay them money, pay them money, pay them money, pay them money, pay them money, pay.  Pay.  Never stop paying.  Never stop paying them money.

The most senior officials quite like their lifestyles of control of the methmphetamine and ketamine and other drugs.  They quite like their 'patients' doing anything anything anything anything anything they say.  Right?  That's what it's about.  Right?  So motivating and inspiring...  And it all starts with paying Crimson Education.  Right?  For the answers to the tests.  Right?  So that one can get busy performing 'cervical examinations' on non-consenting patients.  To be uploaded in 5G to the cloud servers.  Documenting that you are one of 'them'.  The 'elite white minority'.  Part of the cool kids.  The in-group.  Above the law.  So high up themselves they don't have the most basic conception of justice or fairness at all.  

There are none so deaf as those who will not hear.  Who go about proclaiming everyone else to be incapacitated so that they can bully them to death in order to collect up all of the things for themselves.  Such charmers.  Do you feel sufficiently motivated and inspired?
