                                <p>Mirror on society</p>

                                <p>When society doesn't look like what the group of elitist bigots in Medicine think that it should (the whole mirror on society polilcy in medicine) then they must be more foreful wlith the social engineering so that they can really construct the world as they want it to be.  The problem is not with how people are selected into, progressed, graduated (or not), employed (or not), within Medicine.  The problem is that society isn't quick enough to mirror the likes of Dr Leeks.  Must have.  Professor Glues Glue Factory.  Most desirable.  Hurry up New Zealand.  Comply with Government directive to be a mirror on Medicine!  Hurry up people!  Get busy busy busier being the sexual and violent offenders that we choose to harbor within Medicine.  They think they are normal.  NOrmal.  Just like everybody else.  It isn't like everybody else wouldn't have commited the same atrocities as De Leeks if they thought they could get away with it -- right?  He's totally a mirror for the likes of you and me...  The various things we are supposed to believe of the Medical Doctors.  The atrocities.  The selling off the medical supplies, involuntary and unlawful drugging.  Etc etc.  Hurry up rest of NZ.  Catch up!  Develop, already, into the mirror tht they require you to be!!!  </p>

                                <p>What's that?  The Government keeps some people so poorly that they are required to steal food.  No nononono says the Government.  They have  binge eating disorder.  We must keep them in an institution now, on less than $1 a day.  If they don't shut the f*ck up about it.  Right?  Isn't that the function of Medicine?  A little raping and torturing and murdering.  Wrongful deathbrining.  Slicing and dicing.  Implanting.  Expermenting on.  Observing the harms.  Observing the harms.  Recording your observations of the harms.  But the peple are, generally speaking, degenerate criminals, all of them.  Right?  Therefore in order to mirror society we can only acknowledge and employ the degenerate criminals that they are required to mirror.  Hurry up New Zealand!  Mirror the esteemed Medcial Professionals!  Murder your wife for insurance to live with a hooker.  Give party drugs to teenagers and kill one when she says she will tell peopel that you interfered with her after she'd been drugged.  What else can we do!!!  Give LSD to people then say they must be detained involuntarily in the name of psychosis.  Take the infants out early and raise them in incubators.  Get a court order if fhe parents get upset about further interference.  What else can we do?  Staff teh hospital with people who pay the university pay the university pay the university.  Else unpaid volunteers.  What else can we do?  QUite the society they are building.  Hey.  Quite the society indeed. </p>

                                <p>Throwing the applications away.  IN order to expediate the selection fo the above kinds of 'must have' Medical Doctors' who they think society must be forced to mirror.</p>

                                <p>I think that if you had indepdnent people actually recording how many people do traffick through the NZ hospitals that you will find that they are double and triple billing for people.  I think that many of the people they are claiming thousands of dollars per night for are not to be found in teh hospital.  Because they are keeping false records to collect more money.  Also I think you will find that many of them are being involuntarily detained unlawfully.  That operations are not done that are billed for.  That things are (unlawfully) done that are not billed for.  I know the courts won't find this.  They are required to be a mirror on society, too.  It's all about managing the 'perception' of corruption apparently.  Which involves going around poking all the f*cking eyes out.  What do you see in the mirror with your f*cking eyes poked out?  Want to shut the f*ck up about the whole 'mirror on society' thing now?  Corruption.  Corruption.  Should everybody be forced to be as corrupt as the Medical then?  That's the aspirational goal from Medicine.  TO normalise their corruption.  They win, you see.  THey are the great winners at life.  Doing anything anything anything (rape, wrongful death) being handed tools for their crimes (drugs, surgical equipment, places to perform or commit their atrocities).  Security guards ensuring the 'patients' stay where they are supposed to be.</p>

                                <p>A hospital outfitted mostly by security guards or military.  A military hospital. Where people are required to be in the hospital by court order under military instructions that people cannot leave...  Is not really a hospital, eh?</p>

                                <p>Will Stuart McCutcheon be cremated quickly quickly so he can never be exhumed for a DNA test?  I bet he will be...  At the very least.   Show the people his teeth...  All of them.  In a pickle jar.</p>

                                <p>Why isn't my MA in the University of Waikato PHilosophy Department?  I see various other peoples masters and doctoral theses in the department and they are supposed to be lodged there.  I submitted 2 hardcopies and one was supposed to go to the library (did it?) and the other was supposed to be lodged in the department.  ANd it is not there.  Who stole it?  Where is it?  Why does the Univesrity of Waikato not want to be seen to have any research output?  I suppose because NZ chose to fund Professor Glue's Glue Factory and get Auckland people to start manufacturing LSD so they could increase the incidence of hallucinations therefore delusions therefore unlawful detentions allegedly or apparently on psychiatric grounds.  Is what they chose to fund as a response to my research output.  How to grow their business.  The psychopathy business, I mean to say.</p>

                                <p>In response to my 2018-2019 thesis on disabilty and equity in medicine and public health they chose to lock down the nation in the name of public health emergency rseponse and declare war on the people.  They rolled out healthy home standards, tried deinstitutionalising some people by putting them in emergency accommodations, got rid of the DHB's, set up a ministry for disability.  Even (after I suggested a vote of no confidence to the AUSTRALIAN organiser of a public meeting on the issue) got around to appointing a person actually with disabiltiy to be CE.  The one who was previously head of something something disability with the ministry so business as usual there.  But the interesting thing was the Australian telling everyone 'that was the best you are going to get take what you can get if you vote no confidence in the non-disabled ministry leader they won't give you a ministry at all'.  THey declared war on the people.  The courts wrote that they don't see anything wrong with the univesrity treating people the way they do.  THey don't have to get work to externals, they don't have to progress people or graduate people, they don't have to enrol peple.  THey can choose whoever they want for whatever arbitrary reasons they want with complete immunity.  THey can get professor glue drugging the teenage girls with horse tranquiliser or feeding them LSD so as to imprion them in the name of psychiatry.  There's actually nobody home.  NOthing there in NZ.  There is no alternative.  Apparently.  To the Dr Leeks..  I'm sorry..  The Professor Glue Professional Glue Factory.  Nobody there.  NOthing home.</p>

                                <p>Oh, also the government paid other people (not me) to write some report on disability.  It was required to be late.  The idea/l that the government was trying to portray or convey or whatever is that anything to do with disabiltiy is required to be (1) late (2) more costly.  That's supposed to be why it is true to think that it would be costly and time consuming to view disability as anything other than a costly time consuming thing.  If you get disabled people to do something then it will be more expensive and also late.  Correct?  That's why they wnat to disable the entire population.  So they don't pay tehm (that would be costly) and because they can't do any work in a timely fashion.  Right?  The incapacitated.  Anyway, the government got some report and then wouldnt' accept it until it was late.  Was that some kind of a nod to me.  Because I can't be productive.  Oh.  No, that's right any outputs from me are garbage.  Yes.  That's how I got so many A's and A+'s and first in class.  Because I'm garbage.  The academic work I have done (on writing and seminars) and the publication with OUP is garbage.  Ashley is the only game in town.</p>

                                <p>They won't acknowledge the 2 year master of counselling degree from Waikato.  Not going to pay anybody to do that job.  They limit clinical psychology intake to 8 per year -- was it?  What is the fate of those 8 studnets?  I imagine they refuse to garduate tehm.  But even if they do graduate them they will never pay tehm to see clients.  THey will pay tehm to write reports on how they recommend no treatment and how the only funded treatment will make them worse.  THey are paid to make people worse only so they can go 'see!  The only morally acceptable thing for me to do is take money and not do any work'.  Like with the doctors in the hospitals -- right?  What doctors.  It would be unethical for doctors to actually be in teh hospitals given that they don't have the medical supplies or the safe staffing levels or anything at all.  Make way for the psychopaths!  Taken over everything.  Only peopel in there.  The unpaid 'volunteers' helping themselves.  What's iin it for them?  It's not about the money it's about something different entirely...</p>

                                <p>Rape isn't about sex it's about power.  That's why it isn't gendered.  Particularly in tehse parts where it is very very much about power and little of anything else, honestly.  The money is also just a tool or mechanmism for asserting power.  That's why they intentionally withhold and keep people in conditions of deprivation.  But it isnt' about the money because they will also happily give or make availabel ridiculous sums to some..  We are supposed to believe..  Why?  It doesnt' actually make any sense..  It's not about the money, though.  It's some stupid hierarchy or something where because they want everyone to beleive Ashley is worth three quarters of a million per year..  Well.  They want him to be moving into a VC role in the near future.  I suppose that's the ideal.. Redeploy him into that.  Because he's the only game in town for all of the everything of course.  ANd the pay was comparable.  Why not get Una Jagose?  She's good at throwing away evidnece and preventing and prohibiting genuine claims from progressing thorugh the courts.  Aucklaknd Uni could do with more thn al ittle of tht, I would suppose.  As could they all..  WHere is Una these days?  Still ordering evidence to be thrown away?  Stil lrefusing to instruct the prosecution of corruption within the executive?</p>

                                <p>Here is a post-modernist essay generated content:  https://www.elsewhere.org/pomo/  If you refresh the page you will get a new essay.  It is computer generated.  For people who haven't studied post-modernism (I have not) it looks, uh, like it really could be a genuine intellectual work.  Shows what little I know about post-modernism, or something.  So..  That's the starting point.  It's a post-modernist essay generator.  Now, think what management-speak essay generators might be able to do.  What kind or sort of output.  Think about what government-speak essay generators might be able to do.  What judgment-generators could do for the courts.  Think about medical diagnostics medical opinion or medical professional opinion judgment generators.  Now think of the interests that a few people have in collecting up allllll of the money for saying that they hire or command a staff or army of 500 employees, or something like that..  Imagine if you could simply not pay any of them.  Have their work done by an AI programme instead.  You would need to start by altering their job descriptions intentionally.  I would imagine that if your aim or goal was to remove all the academics from the university and replace them with AI generated garbage (which is in fact what seems to have  been happening for quite some time) then you probably would need to start by cracking down on anything that clearly is not the output of such a progrmme.  So it is less obvious when there aren't any people left.  Oh.  But there never were any people.  Right?  Any what?  Do you ever remember there being people to yakkity yak to about their research within the University?  It was about travelling and partying and drinking and hanging out.  Wasn't it?  What research?  What research outputs? </p>

                                <p>So where does the research funding go, then?  When it isn't going to any actual people and when the millions and millions and millions isn't going to any actual researchers because there aren't any researchers there isn't any academic output.  Where does ethe money go?  Where does all the research funding go?  I don't know if it would be worse for the University of Waikatko to have fake or phoney output like that or to sort of blatently, really, embrace the state of little to no output at all.  There is some research unit associated with the Waikato District Health Board.  They were offering $5,000 scholarships for research aligned with their targets. Apparently my research proposal (on disability and equity in medicine and public health) was garbage.  Apparently they chose to fund a psychology studnet instead.  I have tried to find out whether some psychology studnet actually got the scholarship and got credit for her 1 year research masters or if they bullied her into fleeing and published the work as their own.  THey won't provide the information so I think that actually they did not give the scholarship to anybody.  The people allegedly on payroll for the Waikato DHB as researchers pass off the studnets work as their own after bullying the studnets into fleeing.  But then why think that there actually are any researchers hired by the DHB?  Since they are pretending that they have outputs by reattributing the studnets work maybe the people supposedly on payroll are non-existent.  Not on payroll at all.  So, then, wehre does the money go?  To the CE of teh DHB?  To Stuart McCutcheon for supplying the university or dhb with the intellectual property of the undergrads to pass off as their own?  ANd then of course strategic computer generated content.  ANd then the psychopathy element or aspect of people paying money to actually get to perform or commit atrocities.  Then requiring studnets to write that up and position themselves to be blamed for making up dodgey data and so on.</p>

                                <p>What is the goal the aim the purpose the point?  To keep as many 'people' (we like to call them) as poorly as possible.  To have them kept in government institutions on less than a dollar per day, or similar so that we happy few can do anything anything anything anything collecting up millions and millions and millions of taxpayers dollars because really really really small people need things like that in order to feel halfway decent about themselves, or similar.  It's a bit difficult to know what to say.  Opportunism, apparently.  Is probably the most charitable thing that can be said for it.  So...  The Governmetn wants to be able to say that however many FTE paid positions are in fact something that exists in the NZ economy.  But, of course, the posistions are not fulled by actual people and the payroll money does not go to them.  I wonder how many FTE paid positions there actually are, in NZ.  Partciularly wehn you consider how very heavy handed the government is and the relative lack of private sector (where the private sector is largely payrolled by the government and only kept afloat by the constant government handouts).  Would you say that...  1/4 of New Zealanders (between the ages of 20 and 65) have 1 FTE positions?  Of course the government cries about them being wastrels who are too stupid or lazy to work so they need to offer paid employment to people from overseas since we don't have graduates of our own education and traiing programmes (won't even enrol studnets in the qualifications if we think they do have the capacity to do the work in order to ensure we don't hire anybody to work that job). </p>

                                <p>I can't keep up with the high school teacher situation.  Apparently there aren't enough teachers for them to have paid employment.  Appraently there are too many teachers for them to have paid employment. Apparently there aren't enough teachers for the schools to have teachers in teh classrooms.  Apparently there are too omany teachers to fill the classrooms.  Too many nont enough too many not enough.  Breed more breed more there aren't enoguh!  Too many time for the cull!  Boom and bust!  More people in worse conditions!  More people iln worse conditions!  Apparently there aren't enough buildings to have teachers in teh classrooms.  Apparently there isn't enough money to pay the teachers to be in the classrooms.  Apparently there aren't enough kids to pay the teachers.  Apparently there are too many kids to fill the buildings.  Apparently there aren't enough buildings in which to put the teachers or the kids.  There's really nobody home.  NOthing there.  Garbage wasteland.  What are we waiting for?  A letter of introduction for some pedophile from the Northern Hemisphere, I suppose, with some plan as to how we can make money pimping out the kids or selling off their intellectual property or creative outputs.  Put them to work in the name of training program.  Never garduate tehm.  Never pay them.  Never stop.  Never stop.  Never stop keeping slaves.</p>

                                <p>So...  Entire books.  Journals.  Edited Collections.  Essays.  Abstracts.  Particularly things kept behind a paywall...  So that you can only read the abstract.  Entire corpuses of supposed academic work are actually literally the outputs of computer programmes.  Apparently 1/3rd of twitter accounts are actually bots.  Robots.  Artificial intelligence programmes.  1/3rd of twitter accounts are actually bots.  I don't really look at Twitter (because I heard it was for twits from sources I tend to trust) any more than I look at Farcebook (because it's a portmantau of having all the faces then the asses to go with the faces in a sort of a porn hub upload whether you ever wanted or asked for or intended it or not.  I mean how many people are forced into government institutions at various points of or in their lives?  I mean think about it for 5 f*cking minutes...  The farce that is the directory of facebook, or whatever.  I mean, you sort of go, maybe the people in charge of facebook are more likely to have integrity in how they view the faces in NZ who signed up than the NZ government?  So they might actually want to help the people they see in NZ when the NZ government doesn't see people it just sees animals to exploit.  Why think that the people in charge of farcebook would think anything other than that all the supposed or alleged or apparent people are a farce?  It doesnt' make any sense...</p>

                                <p>I am pretty certain that the children in the elite private schools are provided with carefully curated (by others) farcebook accounts.  And that their parents don't upload content of them in violation of their privacy.  What is most interesting from a psychopathic point of view is that the kiddies are sold into being pimped out by their parents at such a very very very young age so they can be targeted by all the malcious and malevolent others...  The NZ government particularly is all about identifying vulnerable targets to ship them off to the Glue factory at the first availabel opportunity.  Right?  The aim or goal being the untimley extermination or elimination of as many of us as possible.  Right?  So that one victor will remain!  Because they insist on playing some stupid hierarchical survival of the fittest game.  Their nasty bruitish and short little lives.  RIP Stuart McCutcheon.  You will be remembered for your role in the demise of the Univesrity of Auckland.  From pretty crappy to utter garbage.  Well done.  Was it fun for you?  Did you enjoy getting to pomp about in your silly silks?  All eyes on you all eyes on you all eys on you.  Won't even calculate a GPA.  What University?</p>

                                <p>The function of law.</p>

                                <p>In upside down and back to front in is out and out is in and right is wrong and so on and so forth land.  Where Ashley Bloomfield is the most highly qualified candidate for Professor, and similar nonsense...  The function of law needs to be rightly understood.  So that people understand that if there is to be any justice at all it will not be via the courts.  That appears to be the precedent that the courts are willing to set.  If you look the judiciary's failure to uphold justice for all of my filings you will see that there appears to be little to no point in brining injustices to the courts.  THey seem to think their job is to delay and obstruct and deliver garbage outputs of nonsense, honestly.  Blatantly making false claims about evidence that they have received (when they have not).  For example, electrical reports).  Ignoring evidence they were supplied with (applications to enrol).  Ignoring statutory law (ignoring half the education act - the ones conferring responsibilities onto the Universities).  The judges seem to think the statutes grant unlimited power to the universities of NZ to do anything.    </p>

                                <p>Anyway.  The point is that they wrongfully fire you, say.  Then what?  You are supposed to pay the courts and pay a lawyer tens of thousands of dollars.  Likely the courts won't find in the interests of justice so you will be punished by the courts for having complained.  You will need to pay the courts and pay the lawyer for furthering the cause of injustice.  Else, maybe the judge will actually find in the interests of justice.  Unlikely. What they then won't do is get the univesrity or whoever wronged you to cover the court costs.  But even if they will do that they won't get them paying for the legal costs that you incurred.  But even if they do that they won't be required to pay any compensation.  But even if they are required to do that it will be a slap in the face insult amount only.  So...  If justice is what you seek..  In a timely fasion..  Then probably you want to aim firework displays in particular directions as that apparently isn't unlawful.  But even if it was what are they going to do about it?  Or just whack people with a big stick until they feel motivated to do their job, or something.  Maybe if people beat Dawn Freshwater with a taser or something she would find it within herself to uphold freedom of speech for her employees that she says don't have any?  I don't really know what to say..  Word salad word salad word salad, right?  Allllll the publications for Ashley.</p>

                                <p>I think 'free speech' is a diversion or red herring.  To try and cover up that they intentionally hired people into academic positions or posts when they knew full well they didn't have willingness and / or ability to publish research.  They weren't hired on the basis of their academic merits I mean to say.  They were hired for the other qualities that they value.  Their abiltiy to unlawfully get the nation in lockdown and similar virtues.  Without any legal repurcussions.  Must have. </p>


                                <p>Stuart McCutcheon is allegely dead.  The f*cking imbecile who refused to calculate my GPA for 2x years because someting something about raping and deporting international studnets since their visas expired and there were no qualifications for them.  That wasn't just a once off event -- right?  There was quite the pipeline of them.  Yes?  That's what the secure ward of the Grafton Hospital is for.  Correct?  How many University of Auckland studnets get placed in there when it is time to sign off on their qualification completion (or similar)?  WHen is the open casket funeral for Stuart McCutcheon?  I am sure that many people will choose to take up edu-tourism opportunities to come check for themselves that he, in fact, is actually, finally, completely, totally, irrevokably, f*cking dead.  With all the very very best of the healthcare that his money could buy.  At hte very very least everyone expects a convincing plastics job so that people can see an approximation of him in the f*cking casket.</p>

                                <p>I mean, seriously, I don't know what his f*cking wife does, all day.  If she has a salary of her own or if she spends a quarter of his earnings on meth..  How many children he has and if they spend half of his earnings on raping and pillaging small island communities..  But I do know for a fact that he was (apparently or allegedly according to official documentation sources) paid..  How much?  How much over about 15 years to  be VC of the University of Auckland?  Where did all the money go.  Where is the money?  Moo laa.  Where did the f*ckign money go.  WHERE IS THE F*CKING MONEY?????  COMPREHEND>  AYE??  WHERE IS THE F*CKING MONEY??  Independent genetic tests of a sample of the open casket to DNA match it with the kiddies.  I would imagine or suppose.  The very very very very very very best of the  healthcare athat all of your f*cking millions and f*cking millions of dollars of NZ taxpayers dollars. Civil servant.  Yeah, f*cking right.  Corruption.  Corruption corruptin.  WHere is the f*Cking money?  This f*cking idiot imbecel moron couldn't f*cking parse the education act and calcuate a f*cking GPA in according.  F*cking idiot imbecel moron.  No?  He's not intellectually handicapped intellectually retarded from birth or aquisiion in a way that is not his fault.  What's that you say?  Oh.  He's a corrupt psychopath is he?</p>

                                <p>I mean seriously.  Take a look at the Univesrity of Nottingham, or similar.  Check for the newly appointed VC with a name along the lines of 'Sunrise moonbeam' and that will be Stuart McCutcheons new role for which he is earning British Pounds, now, in exhchange for all the raping and bullying and so on and so forth..  His whole programme or project for undermining the Universities of NZ can be rolled out accross the UK now.  I would imagine or suppose.  Oxford, maybe.  So they can cry cry cry cry cry cry cry bout how there arne't any f*cking acaemics because the only peopel on payroll are too f*cking stupid to get their slaves work out for externl examination.  F*cking incompetents.</p>

                                <p>If you wonder about the swearing it's just me apeing Sterelny.  Anybody who has spent appreciable time with  him will know it's all 'f*cking c*nt' this and 'f*cked the dog' that.  He's known for his 'eloquence', apparently.  I can't / don't see it myself,  honestly.  I find it very hard to believe that half of what has ever been attributed to him in print could ever  have come out of his mouth.  But then there's the likes of David Lumsden, I suppose.  About 5,000 words every decade, was it?  I I I I I I It would b b b b b be r r r r rude to point that out though, right?  Just be patient for a d d d d d d decade or ten right?  So the paid position can go to a young graduate of Otago to ensure that nobody else ever gets signed off as completing the qualification.  No applications, apparently.  No applicants.  No completions.  No employment.  No jobs.  No qualifications.  Just levels of debt against their name.</p>

                                <p>Anybody who has been to the Univesrity of Auckland knows full well that there is no way that a student can forge their way into cadavar laboratory.  The roll for the class will have the number of studnets enrolled in the class and there will be identification numbers, photographs of the student from their id card, and so on.  There is no way that the teaching staff in the cadavar laboratory were swindled by someone forging themselves an identificfation card.  What, did they forge themselves a studnet identificaftion card number that was also forged as being on the roll?  What a f*cking joke.  It doesn't happen.  I'm sure they triple check the students are actually enrolled properly so that they don't get UN inspectors or the like documenting their crime documenting tehir crimes documetning their crimes.</p>

                                <p>So what are we left with, then, when we hear that when it is time to pay them for the work they have done the University says that they didn't graduate.  Can't pay them because the University didin't graduate them.  Didn't ever enrol them, apparently.  The studnet forged themselves onto the studnet roll.  Forged themselves a studnet idenfitication number with a workign barcode so they could swipe into laboratories.  It isn't plausible at all.  What is plausible is that when it was time to pay the worker fro the work that they had been doing (over how many years of student internships and the like passing them off as consultants and qualified doctors) then when it was time for them to pay the worker kthey put them in prison or psych hospital and get more and more and more and more money for having imprisoned them.  F*cking psychopath land.  There aren't any doctors or teachers or anything.  They are imprisoned for hteir crime of having met teh requirements of the qualifications they applie dto be enrolled in.  The hsopitals and schools etc have all been overtaken by taken over by psychoapths.  Pedophiles.  Offenders.  Depoloyed and redeployed and redeployed.  Shuffling the sh*t around.  They don't even apply for their postions.  Right Ashley?  Why would you apply to be Professor when you never applied to be enrolled in PhD, never wrote one, never submitted one for examination.  Never worked at a Univesrity..  There's no universities here.  What a f*cking joke.  There isn't anything.  The Government chooses to declare war on all the people.  What a f*cking joke.</p>

                                <p>My flatmate used to get paid market research. She'd get a survey form and some money to go buy McDonalds or similar and record whether the premises were tidy or whether they upsold her order.  It's disingenuous to think that that kind or sort of thing cant'  be done or isn't being done for quality control purposes of social services.  Checking whether they are processing applciations.  Whether they are grading work  properly. Whether they are teaching classes properly.  Garbage wasteland.  There's nothing here.  F*cking fraud of a hoax of a garbage wasteland.</p>

                                <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/300762830/crash-survivor-says-shortstaffed-tauranga-like-a-war-hospital  The flourescent lights are something else, aren't they?  What part of it is hard to understand?  The Government chose to declare war on the people.  The aim the idea/l thep urpose the goal is to exertimate as many as possible as quickly as possible.  You are lucky to have made it out of there alive.  What part of that is hard to udnerstand?  Don't present for social services.  There aren't any social services.  Social services are not for you.  They aren't processing applications for peple to be enrolled in or train in social service professions.  They aren't advertising positions.  They aren't hiring.  They won't pay workers.  They are waiting for psychopaths from northern hemisphere to pay the government to commit atrocities.  That apppears to be all there is.  That is to say there is nothing here.  They can't  / won't process applications to enrol.  Nobody home.</p>

                                <p>Don't forget to spread your legs for Chris Hipkins, everybody!  Almighty Minister of Everything!</p>

                                <p>Who wants to be an artist? Remember how New Zealand treated Janet Frame?  Let that be a lesson to you all, all the kiddies in and of New Zealand.  Of what it is that we like to do.  Right when it is time for us to pay her us to pay her us to pay her us to pay her us to pay her for teaching in the schools we decide that it is more profitable for the New Zealand economy to put her in an institution and have her write about the crimes.  Write about the crimes.  Write about the crimes. What has changed?  Nothing.  Nothing has changed.  Roll it out to more and more and more and more and more.  How much was Colin McCahon paid for his art work during his lifetime?  Got to be artist in residence did he?  Janet Frame?  Got to be artist in residence with the Univesrity of Otago for all the art work she's producing for the NZ economy.  Let that be a lesson to you all.  Hotore...  So many New Zealanders. Where does all the arts funding go?  Lord God Ashley collected it all up for himself, did he?  What's his children doing now?  Playingn slum Gods with John Key's progeny?  How much money did he need to pay to have him do anything anything anything anything to the scum of France, for a while?  How many virgins needed to  be sacrificed for them to live the life they believe they are entitlted to.  What a f*cking farce of a hoax of a joke of a f*cking scum of a wasteland.  No people here.  Never was.  Never were.   Never will be.</p>

                                <p>I mean, look at the State of New Zealand!  The State of the Godless Heathens.  Worshiping Ashley Bloomfield like he's Christ come again.  A Government that is...  Entirely?  Is it entirely funded by the proceeds of crime?  I remember Jane Kelsey (hey thanks for my 'first in class' for 'law and society' guess that means I'm stuck being your unpaid b*tch for the next 5 decades) saying that the Government does not collect most of the tax money that it should collect.  It only collects taxes from the poor people (the working poor people).  I guess it really only runs off the proceeds of crime.  Why?  Because then the Northern Hemisphere lot don't have to feel like they are being inhumane or inhuman how they choose to experiment on and keep the 'people' in this part of the world.  Criminal degenerates only.  Godless heathens. There isn't any research output.  There aren't any people in that part of the world.  You see?</p>

                                <p>Oooooh who wouldn't want to go to Oxford?  See which super special magical genious 12 year old progedy gets to be raped all voluntary by this that or the other of teh adminstration.  Super special never seen anything like it.  Sooooo mature.  Must have.  Watching the 'high value' in-breed idiots f*cking get driven to class with chaufers in their f*cking Lamborginis or similar.  What a f*cking farce of a joke of a hoax of a scum of a scam.  What health system?  What judiciary?  In-bred f*cking idiots f*cking ruining everything for everyone.  F*cking imbecels.  F*cking retards.  That's what retard and imbecel and psychopath meeeeeeeans.  Comprehend.  Aye?  No spiikity da Engleeeeesh.  Duuuuuuuuuh.  What federal voting papers for New Zealanders???  Duuuuuuuuuh.  Tooooooo stuuuuuuuupid.  Nooooo understaaaaaaand.  Duuuuuuuuuuhh.</p>

                                <p>Things I have changed my mind about..</p>

                                <p>I used to think that people who didn't want vaccines or medical treatments that doctors said were necessary were science-deniers or conspiracy theorists.  I now think that there are very good scientific reasons to be sceptical of what 'doctors' say is necessary and very sceptical indeed about the aims or goals of the 'medical 'profession given the aims or goals of government.</p>



                                <p>I used to think the aim or goal or government was to serve the people.  To try and make things better for more people.  Most people.  Not in the sense of trying to breed more (younger ones being happier or at least being more easily prevented from saying they are unhappy) or trying to murder off the unhappy ones.  Not fiddling the stats like that.  Perverse incentives.   But genuinely to make things better for more of us.  Now I think that the government actually thinks that it's goal or aim or purpose or point is to charm and con and swindle the people into compliance such that things can be worse and worse for more of us for their own selfish personal advantage.</p>

                                <p>I used to think that NZ basically had a functioning health system, education system, judiciary.  Problems, to be sure, but I thought that people were, again, trying to have things develop in better directions.  Working towards making things better.  Serving the public.  Public servants.  But now I see various people allegedly or apparently on quarter or half a million dollar per year salaries destroying evidence, pretending to be too stupid to speak English and / or read laws written in plain English etc.</p>

                                <p>I used to believe that people (most people, mostly) were good, or at least trying to be.  Aspired or aimed to things like honesty and kindness and fairness in their interactions and dealings.  </p>


                                <p>I used to think that things were merit based, primarily, and that merit would shine through.  That people could telt the basic difference, and that that meant something.  And now I need to stop and explain this because of how much has been invested in telling people with merit that they lack merit and telling people without merit that they are the meriotus ones.  Think of it this way...  What do we think is involved in 'academic merit'?  It could  be choosing to spend your time studying.  Maybe even choosing to forgo part time work so as to have time to spend studying during the semester.  More time spent studying should have someething to do with higher or better grades.  That's what makes study an investment.  Or maybe 'academic merit' is something given to people who spend all their time party party partying with the administration?  Going to 1:1 meetings with supervisors and administrators saying 'yes sir no sir three bags full sir'?  Yakkity yak yak yakking at morning tea and lunch and afternoon tea.  Drinks.  Dinner. Why spend your time studying or reading or working on assignments when you could be giving blow jobs to the administration?  Paying bribe money to the writers of exams?  Paying off Crimson Education?  Being handed grades because of who your parents are?  The way to an academic career is clearly to not do the readings or put any work into assignments.  It's to cry cry cry cry cry to the person paid to teach you to, effectively, write it for you, else you will never receive a passing grade.
                                </p>

                                <p>I used to believe that the reason why NZ Universities didn't really graduate Masters or PhD students (unless or untill they agreed that they never would have employment as an academic) was because the Universities most often hired people who were not very productive themseleves who put their own crap onto their students and required, therefore, their studnets to work even slower than them.  I mean to say, they hired people who did not regularly give new seminars (rather, giving old seminars) and who did not regularly get new work out for publication.  They would work for 2+ 5+ 10+ years on the very same seminar or publication.  Or they simply wouldn't do anything at all after they finished their PhD.  No new research.  Who knows if they even wrote their PhD or whether they were handed something from the trophy room or if it was written by their supervisor or stolen from someone else who was bullied into fleeing because the University accused them of having written a neo-Nazi manifesto  because they wanted to give their research outputs to someone else.  </p>

                                <p>I wasn't sure the source of the beliefs that the academics have that it needs to take 2+ 5+ 10+ years to get a, roughly, 5,000 - 7,000 length work published.  A new talk (on a new topic) or a new article on a new topic.  How long should it possibly take to write that much?  5 years?  What is the research output of the philosophy department?  That's how come the students aren't allowed to do any work once they get to graduate school?  They can copy-paste their 30 or 60 or 120 first year students essays on Descartes into an output they claim as theirs.  Nothing a computer programme wouldn't or couldn't do.  They don't hire academics they hire mismanagers to mismanage everythign me-wards.  The great hoax scam fraud on all the people.  HOw many years can it possibly take do so so f*ckign little work?  Oh, yeah, nobody else applied for the job.  Nobody else got an application for the job.  Nobody else had a PhD.  Nobody else applied.  Allll the jobs for the Right Honorable Lord and Savior God Ashley Bloomfield.</p>

                                <p>Transparency doesn't undermine public confidence.  Corruption undermines public confidence.  YOu don't need to do a 5 generations long non-degree course in philosophy to understand the basic appearance reality distinction whereby nobody cares about the perception of corruption (the solution to the corruption problem woudl be to poke all their f*cking eyes out).  </p>

                                <p>When it becomes known how f*cking corrupt the officials are -- and more to the point how they refuse to get with the f*cking development programme because of how f*cking corrupt they are.  Then they are themselves undermining of everything.  There is nothing here.  Don't blame me.  I'm just descsribing.  Blame the people who insist upon conducting themselves in this manner or way.  The people who won't allow or have things any other way.  What's that Dawn Freshwater?  YOu wre drawn to take more than half a million dollars from NZ for your role as  being VC of the Univesrity of Auckland because here you only need to hire one person and everybody can coalesce or congel around them. That means you can take the rest of the salaries for yourself -- right?  You don't need to hire any academics.  Not once you've hired Lord God Ashley.  You can simply plop all the undergrads work (yeah, right) just pass the outputs of a computer progamme off as the outputs of your slave detention prison camp you have there.  What University?  What research ouptuts?  What reports from examiners?  Check out the research?  Designed to show off how there is no Univesrity only.  The only things that claim to have any funding.  The prention nd prohibition of developoment programme.  What did you do in England to be shipped to the colonines to manage the slave detention camps down here?  Was Dawn Freshwater your name you were given at birth?  Doesn't seem likely to me.  Sounds like marketing to me.  So that people who were exposed to too much lead (what the government thinkgs of the gamma babies in NZ) will think that you *sound* okay.  The connotations of your name.  That kind of thing is very important to the imebecel rulers.  In a singing triumphantn songs as they are marched off to the death camp kind of a way.</p>
</p>

                                <p>--</p>

                                <p>I suppose the government is being pretty blatent, now, about withholding university qualifications from people who were enrolled in them and who did the work for them in order to re-deploy ministry officials into those positions.  To have the ministry officials pass themselves off as qualified professionals.  Who are the ministry officials?  Well, I don't know how many of the NZ government ministry officials are actually people who came here on foreign passports all voluntary-like.  Like New Zealander of the Year (born in South Africa, Educated in England) and so on...  I suppose the idea was that there weren't any people in NZ actually from NZ for one of them to be eligible for NZer of the year.  The only eligible applicant was...  Well...  When did she become a citizen?  Did she?  How much money did someone or other pay to have her crowned as NZer of the year?  It really doesn't make any sense, at all... </p>

                                <p>So Dr Ashley Bloomfield (MBChB) is Professor of the Univesrity of Auckland, now.  He does not have a PhD, any tutoring grading or lecturing experience, academic publications.  Therefore must have.  He must have been the only applicant for the postion.  Nobody with a PhD applied.  Nobody with any tutoring grading or lecturing experiece applied.  Nobody with any academic publications.  They didn't get a single applicant with any experience of working in a Univesrity environment.  Nobody from New Zealand and nobody from overseas.  With all the layoffs that AUT is doing nobody with any university experience applied or was encouraged to apply to become Professor of the University of Auckland.  Ashley Bloomfield was the best candidate for the job.  There isn't any corruption in New Zealand.  No corruption, at all.  Now that the courts have ruled that the Government does't need students to actually apply to courses for the 'University' to record that they have been enrolled in courses (and bill their student loans accordingly).  Now Ashley Bloomfield can be an independent contractor to say that he is recieving all of the government research and teaching award money for all of the research and teaching work that he is so renowned for that he gets to be made Professor of New Zealanads premier University! 
                                </p>

                                <p>I would imagine it is quite the pay cut for him (from around half a million to around a quarter of a mmillion, was it?)  I suppose, then, that the deal will come with sweeteners.  A house?  What else?  How many teenager virgins for Ashley?  But it's soooooooooo competitive and New Zealand Universities are garbage garbage garbage for the bottom feeders with no other options garbage garbage garbage.  So say they all.  AUT is garbage.  Waikato is garbage.  Otago is garbage.  NZ is garbage so Auckland certainly is garbage.  Australia, also, is garbage.  Where the garbage goes that did not get to go to the USA.  And of course the USA is garbage, as well.  Unless you pay the University you pay the University you pay the Univesrity for however many studnets you get to call garbage garbgage garbage.  What an experience!  People who refuse to get your work to externals (presumably because it's garbage) so as to prevent and prohibit you from having credit for your work so that Ashley Bloomfield can be the only applicant. The only game in town.  Wah wah wah NZ doesn't have any Medical Doctors.  Right Ashley?  Wah wah wah.  NZ doesn't have any PhD graduates.  Aren't any in the whole world -- right Ashley?  Well then, that must qualify you for ALLLLLL the jobs.  Allllllll the jobs for the Rt Honorable Dr Ashley Bloomfield MBChB PhD MD BS.  Roll up roll up roll up to be signed up for the population health qualification in how people must take their shots one way or another...</p>

                                <p>I guess the idea is that by promoting NZ as being the bottom of the garbage land it means that it can be the destination for all the experimental research that wouldn't get through the ethics boards of overseas.   Because, you know how it is, we will fill the ethics boards with pedophiles, if need be, to ensure the experiments get to keep rolling along.  That sort of explains the cameras in the ethics and psychology seminars.  How the people on staff hang their heads.  They are trying to see who lacks moral emotions.  That seems to be the ideology of it.  People who don't see anything wrong with atrocities.  Must have for everything in NZ.  MOst desirable place to be a psychopath land.  Real destination for all the garbage.  By design.</p>

                                <p>Stanford is saying now about experiments that were done on black prisoners back whenever.  They had signed consent forms and paid them a token for participating as experimental subjects.  They say that people wanted to participate because they were kept poorly enough such that they would be willing to do anything anything anything for the money.  Right?  Anyway, they are saying that it wasn't okay.  But it was in accordance with the ethics or the norms or whatever at the time.  I mean to say they would only hire employees who had that view of it, of course.  NZ is trying to normalise child abuse and so on so that people don't feel that there is anything particularly bad or wrong sending the pedophiles and the like to NZ.  It isn't like the nations in Australasia aren't fill with moral degenerates, right?  They will fit right on in.  Right?  The only sorts of things we want to know or hear about are how degenerate the people in Australasia are endemically.  We only want to hear about the nasty abuses going on within native communities, mostly, especially, so that we can justify shipping the worst of the degenerates off to the colonies to go research on other people children etc.  Right Ashley?  Did they publically advertise your job, then?  Really?  How many applicants were there for your job?</p>

                                <p>So Ashley did a Masters in Public Health.  Was that a 1 year research only masters or a 2 year Masters with maybe 1 year of coursework and a 1 year research component?  How many weeks months years did they get you working on your research component?  2 years?  Before they took another year to examine it?  You mean to say they made you take a PhD length of time (3 years including the examination period) to do 1/2 the work of a PhD?  Did they tell you that was the pathway to becoming an academic?  Did you even write a thesis?  What was your thesis about?  I'm curious because of Stuart McCutcheons being about breeding more lambs than you can feed so you can cry cry cry to the government for more money every winter else the lamb hostages will starve.  Then you use that money you got from the government for fattening them up for the spring slaughter for increased profits for yourself.  Then cry cry cry for more money from the government because you bred more lambs than you would feed through the winter unless the government gave you more and more and more money to feed them through the winter...  Quite the business marketing managing model for the University of Auckland.  Really desirable place for the very very best and brightest of the NZ studnets.  Wouldn't you say?  Must have.  Must have all the best and the brightest studnets of NZ.  Wouldn't you say?  Cry cry cry cry cry for more money from the Government for keeping the lambs going off to the slaughter.  All the Professorships for Ashley!</p>

                                <p>I suppose the idea is that it doesn't matter.  Ashley doesn't need to have a PhD to refuse to supervise studnets in their PhD research.  You can't supervise students in doing a higher level qualificiation than one you have.  Apparently that's why we don't have MD or JD research in NZ.  There isn't anybody with those qualifications to supervise those Degrees.  They are in the University Calendar for a couple of the NZ Universities, but to the best of my knowledge they don't enrol anybody in, supervise, or graduate anybody from those qualifications.  They also don't seem to be enrolling, progressing, or signing off on PhD qualifications, either.  They won't get the students work out to externals.  They won't do it.  They won't help the student get PhD.  The people collecing up all the research money don't want to share.  They want to be the only game in town.  It's sooooooo competitive.  </p>

                                <p>Most if not all of the research projects seem intentionally designed to showcase that the students are lacking in morality and / or integrity and / or knowledge and ability etc etc.  They call them 'terminal degrees' or 'terminal qualifications' because then your right to life, or something, is declared to be given up.  See, your only value is the value that you have to the University that the University can cry for more and more and more and more money from the Government for recording your enrolment and reenrollment and reenrollment and reenrollment nd reenrollment nd reenrollment collecting up more and more and more money.  What is in it for the NZ government?  Every studnet hostage does not count for unemployment or disability stats.  You say they are in 'education and training' programmes.  THen you intentionally record higher and higher and higher levels of debt against their name while refusing to get their work to externals and paying internal people to bully and abuse them.  Worst case you record that you have successfully disabled or handicapped them.  Still don't count for unemployment.  How many FTE positions, in NZ, again?  To be filled by how many people?  How many FTE positions for Ashley?  How many years did he take to complete his 1 year of research research component on his Masters?  Oh, let me guess, Auckalnd lacks the capacity to keep accurate student enrolment records and lacks the capacity to keep transcripts.  What a f*cking joke.</p>

                                <p>You see all the 'must haves' passing themselves off as Medical Doctors, in NZ.  One can only suppose they are paying sums of money in exhange for committing atrocities against the people of NZ.  It is convenient for wrongful deathbringing pedophiles to pass themselves off as Medical Doctors and teachers and the like, for obvious reasons.  THe Universities of NZ are refusing to process applications properly.  What Universities?  What skilled workers?  NZ intentionally sells out the people in order to be, effectively, the prison camp detention land of all the psychopaths shipped here from overseas.  Why the hell did we need to pay someone from England to be Dean of the Research School of the Univesrity of Waikato?  What she does is falsely record student enrolments (by saying that studnets will never get their qualifications unless they reenroll and reenroll and reenroll and reenroll and pay more and more and more money to the University) so as to double bill and keep false enrolment records and then hoard the f*cking theses and not get them out for external examination.  HOw much money do they pay the f*cking psychopath?  Why are we paying a foreigner to undermine the entire f*cking university?  THey don't have the willingness and or ability to get out of the f*cking way of their research students.  It isn't a univesrity.  THey won't do it.  Can't / won't employ anybody willing and or able to supervise graduate student research?  Can't and won't even pay people to get out of the f*cking way so that some actual f*ckign research could be f*ckign done for a f*cking change.  What is the research output of the people paid to do research?  How f*cking slow can they possibly work?  Their first year students output more research than they do ffs.  It really isn't supposed to be that f*cking hard.</p>

                                <p>So, someone with a PhD from the Australian National University (supposedly Australasias Premier Research Institution) says that having a PhD from the ANU really isn't that big of a thing or a deal.  He says that once you have your PhD you realise how many people in the world have a PhD and having one doesn't really mean anything at all.  You see the people who have PhD's and you meet them and see the work they are doing and have done and so on and you realise that having a PhD doesn't really mean anything.  I mean...  I suppose from his perspective, he had a PhD from the ANU but no academic jobs came to him.  No academic job from any University in New Zealand, particularly.  NZ or Australia.  I guess once the likes of Ashley Bloomfield take the academic positions there aren't any jobs left for anybody else.  I guess he wasn't thinking, particularly, about what it means, then, of the people who worked on their PhD for however many years and were never credited as having done enough work for one.  The idea is that when you look at the shit they say is good enough for one then you wonder just how shitty the real shit is when the shit doesn't even get credit for having done one.  They don't really think that a test that gives false negatives...  And what do we call this situation, then?  False positiives?  Attesting to the complete and utter worthlessness and meaninglessness of the whole entire enterprise.  I mean...  Who has their PhD and who doesn't does not appear to be associated with who has actually done the work.  Does not appear to be associated with the quality of the work.  Does not appear to be associated with who the examiners said should have their PhD (if they even get the work out to externals or if the decisions are being made in spite or or despite what externals have to say).  I mean to say there doesn't appear to be anything home...</p>

                                <p>So what are we left with, then?  Well.  A holding facility or detention camp for teenagers, primarily.  Takes children when they are 18.  Or as low as 14, if we are talking about AUT when it came to at least one finance studnet from Vietnam who came to NZ with her not biological Mother legal guardian...  Apparently...  They don't hire University graduates (Ashley doesn't have a PhD but he's supposed to head a graduate research school, now?)  They have no intention of producing University graduates..  It's just another NZ government institution of abuse.  The Australian National Univesrity appears to be just another Australasian institution of abuse.  By design.  Intentionally.  They collected up more and more and more and more money for having studnets enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled.  They refused to get the studnets work to externals in a timely fashion.  They intentionally seemed to move faculty around so as to say that students had been abandoned by their supervisors so they would need to start a new project again under a new supervisor or they would  never qualify to complete their qualification.  I'm looking at all the work that I did (the write ups of talks etc over on the seminars page) and wonder how many people basically took my research output and claimed it as their own and passed it off as their own overseas.  Back in the northern hemisphere or wherever.  NZ Universities handed all their studnets intellectual property over to Turnitin.  Got all of their students intellectual property uploaded into Turnitin.  So that they could fail the studnets out so that other people could go on to claim it as their own work outputs.  Who is Turnitin?  Some American company, apparently.  So that the Professors from American Universities can be attributed with what they think is the best of the work, I suppose.  Which necessitates the elimination of the person who produced it.  Or maybe just relegate them to the garbage wasteland of garbage land.  So that you can feel better about yourself.   Becuase it's sooooooo competitive.  It's sooooo competitive that NZ doesnt' even have journals.  The Philosophy Professor of the Univesrity of Auclkand gets to publish in the NZ Meidcal Students Journal (don't worry Ashley can publish in the academic journals, next, for all the hard work that he's done spending so much of his life working his way up through academia at great cost to himself.  All the investment that he has made of himself all the sacrifies he has  made.  The financial hits in doing jobs in the public service interests.  Not at all folling the path of where the money goes and where the little 18 year old virgins can be...  Drafted?  Drafted to his programme of study?  So that he can refuse to sign them off becuase it's a 'terminal masters' programme where the little researchers go to die so that alllll of the money can be given to Ashley MBChB.  Why doesn't he work with patients?  They pay him to not work with patients.  I suppose some foreigner will pay him...  Half a million dollars?  For...  1 year?  Of getting to play doctors and nurses in the NZ hospitals?  10 weeks of Orthopedic surgeon?  How much money to dump your wife at Hillmorton for the rest of her life, these days?  Just so we understand why the 'Universities' of NZ can't / won't process an application to enrol, progresseion through training, completion of trining.  Can't  / won't publically advertise jobs.  Can't / won't hire people for the jobs.  Can't / won't pay the workers.  Only the pedophile psychopaths need apply stating how much money they will invest in NZ in order to do anything anything anything they want with impunity.  We don't see any corruption, at all...</p>

                                <p>I actually don't know that we are graduating any.  Doctors.  Lawyers.  Engineers.  I think that they wait until they get people who have been struck off from overseas for atrocities and they get them.  Why?  Because they will pay and pay and pay and pay to apply for visas and the like to come to NZ.  Then we can put them to 'work' and not really pay them.  What are they going to do about our not really paying them?  They could leave, then.  We can simply replace them with a new lot of people who have been struck off from overseas because of atrocities.  That makes the worlds offenders most highly desirable, from a NZ point of view.  They can come here and be put to work.  Then we can simply not pay them.  What are they going to do?  If they protest we can take their visa back and deport them.  Are they going to go home and cry about it?  We are only interested in having the ones who are on the radar for atrocities overseas in the first place.  I would imagine or suppose.  So they can't go home and complain.  What do you expect trying to do business with psychopths?  How could you not have expected to be screwed over?  Well...  I suppose you point to high profile people..  Allegedly or apparently Dawn Freshwater is a foreigner who is apparently or alledgedly actually paid half a million NZ dollars per year to play VC of the Univesrity of Auckland.  Why would we believe that?  How does that make any sense?  Allegedly or apparently the Dean of the Research School of the Univesrity of Waikato is paid a few hundred thousand per year in order to hoard theses and refuse to get them to external examiners and refuse to get external examiers the sign off forms and refuse to allow external examiners to sign off that students have done enough for the 120 point research project they applied to be enrolled in.  Why would we believe that they pay her several hundreds of thousands to do that?  Maybe she makes quarter or half a million for the University from the false records and billings?  Is that how it doesn't work?  Is that how the University of Waikato gets to be in it's place as one of the shittest Universities with little to no research output? </p>

                                <p>I guess the money isn't just from the NZ Government.  I was like 'what is in it for the NZ government?'  I mean, they pay the University for keeping the student enrolled.  Well, they don't provide a government job for rhte student who is kept enrolled.  They don't have a graduate level entry job with the government.  So the government pays the University less money than the government would pay the student for keeping the student enrolled.  Why would the student do that?  Who in their right mind would voluntarily consent to that?  Well, then, better collect up more and more money from the government for keeping the student in teh psychiatric hospital.  How many FTE positions are there, in NZ?  To be distributed to how many people?  I mean to say that some people are working more than 1 FTE (are collecting up more than 1 FTE salary) while others are not allowed to do 1 EFT of work in 1 year.  Not because they don't have the capacity or the willingness.  They refuse to allow anybody to do it.  NZ does not have uniersities.  That means we don't have law, engineering, medicine graduates.  We don't have an eudcation and training system.  We have a fraud or a hoax upon all the people.  THe prison camp detention land of the owrld.  Australia thinks it's doing better thn NZ but it isn't.  The f*cking think tank brought to you by Wellington shipped to Canberra ffs?  Selfish selfish selfish.  So f*cking selfish.  </p>

                                <p>There was an interview...  Something about Harvard wanting to give Jacinda a big fat cheque for some reason.  For being a great leader for the Covid response.  So she chose to convert the big fat cheque into a scholarship for a student to go do a 2 year Masters Degree from Harvard with the...  Kennedy School of Leadership and Governance or something like that.  The scholarship was apparently of the value of a couple hundred thousand of NZ dollars.  That means to say the student would have accommodation and living expense money (to buy a winter coat) and textbooks and printing and photocopying and food and so on...  So they could do the programme of study.  They did not say whether it was a once off (for 1 student only to go) or whether it was an ongoing thing.  If it was 1 student per year...  For how many years...  I suppose it was a once-off thing.  For one student to go under that funding arrangment.  The total value was a couple hundred thousand NZ dollars.
                                    <p>

                                    <p>Who went?  I am intersted to know who went.  I suspect the interview was a public service announcement, from Harvard, to the people of NZ to say that they were giving Jacinda Ardern a couple hundred thousand dollars and Jacinda Ardern announced that the value of that would be transferred to a student.  Who was the student?  I am wanting go know for the purposes of accountability.  When did they graduate?  Or did they get no applications?  Did anybody apply?  How many applications did they get?  Were they all deemed 'ineligible to have applied'?</p>

                                    <p>I think it was 2 years later that Jacinda went to Harvard commencement / graduation ceremony.  She wasn't the receipient of the 2 year masters degree, though, was she?  I mean, that was a different thing...  She got an honorary degree.  There are particular letters to indicate Honorary Degree title or status.  She did not get the 2 year masters degree.  That was for not-her.  That was for someone-else.  Did she see the student graduate in the qualification that was associated with the scholarship in her honor?  I wonder the fate of the student...  Did they get an entry level job with the government of NZ after having graduated from the 2 year masters with Harvard?  What are they doing now?  Did they graduate?  Did they return to NZ?  Are tehy locked up in a psyh facility?  Or did the NZ government enrol them in a PhD with a NZ Universitiy (to be deteained indefinately with non pay).  Are they to be enrolled in the Ashley Bloomfield Institution of Research, now?  Where nobody will graduate them with a PhD because Ashley can't supervise PhD level research because he doesn't have a PhD...  Does anybody in NZ have a PhD?  Did the external examienrs sign the sign off forms did they?  I'd love to see signed externl examiner forms...  I am starting to believe that there very well might not be any...</p>

                                    <p>I mean to say I think that maybe the situation is that NZ doesn't actually have any education and training programmes at all.  Australia doesn't either.  We just get shipped the criminals and undesirables from teh Northern Hemisphere.  Or they pay us to do a little 'working holiday' where tehy pay us to do anything anything anything for 10 weeks (Orthopedic Surgery) or whatever it is.  Most of the medical doctors are only here on a temporary basis.  Right?  Visit NZ..  Do a little travelling..  A few 'operations'...  Then ride on out.  Impunity for your crimes.  Cheapest workforce ever where the government is only funded by the proceedds of crime..</p>

                                    <p>Jacinda told them at graduation that abortion was legalised in NZ.  They could look into that and see that nobody had been prosecuted for having performed one and infact we have about the highest rates of abortion.  In fact it woul dbe quite the place to go to if you wanted to early harvest foetal tissue.  Do all your gene studies of implanting embryos that were absolute knock outs all your designer babies.  Implant them in people kept in state care, harvest them from people kept in state care.  Not be held accountable.  Not very long after this Otago gets a big charitable donation, apparently, from an American who wants specifically to enrol lin the cheapest Medical Degree ever in teh english speaking world so that they can donate all the rest o fthe money towards setting up a gene research facility in the honor of a dead infant that they now want to be selected into the training programme for or of.  Quite the destination.  Just so it is that we can understand why the leaders of NZ are throwing away teh applications to enrol.  Will not process applications to enrol from NZ students.  NZers aren't eligible to work those jobs.  People from the NOrthern Hemisphere pay a bunch of money to gome here dn do anything anything anything commit atrocities against the NZ people and the NZ governmetn nd judiciary...  Well...  It's in the bag with Justice Toogood.  I suppose.  He got a 2 year Masters from Yale.  He did not get a JD from the Law School.  He did not go to Law School in the USA.  Fraud upon all the people.</p>

                                    <p>Oh what's that?  Then you must run away.  Go be a third rate American, then.  Better thaan being a NZer.  I mean NZ doesn't have a health system education system functioning Judiciary.  Well.  Neither does America, so far as I can see.  Harvard appears to be wanting to associate with the likes of Jacinda Arden and arrange for people to go commit crimes in NZ.  Quite the destination for the all the 'hgih value people'.  Yeah, right.</p>

                                    <p>However many years ago Benjamin Gibbs resigned from the University of Waikato because they were refusing to get a particular students PhD thesis out to external examiners.  They thought (the administration thought) that  by labelling the thesis a 'neo-Nazi manifesto' they were entitled to hoard it in their trophy room and refuse to get it out to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit the student from being signed off as having done enough for a PhD from the University of Waikato if and only if independent external examiners judged his thesis to be of high enough academic quality for that qualification.  That is or means to say, the University decided that it was not a University, at all.  It was going to refuse to be part of international community and it was going to refuse to listen to international community voice.  People who were on the 'university' payroll thought that they should get to decide whether the student gets their PhD from their institution or not.  Their job was not to help their student be accepted by and part of international community, at all.  Their job was to prevent and prohibit their students (their property) from being seen or being part of international community by hoarding various things away.  Or by simply giving various things away.  Giving their studnets work away to externals with permission for externals to do anything they wanted with the work (including passing it off as their own or the work of one of their own studnets, one can only suppose).  Corruption.</p>

                                    <p>What Universities?  What research output?  The University of Waikato intentionally covered for Alister Gunn after a students mother complained about an inappropriate message that he left on her teenage daughters phone when he was involved in teaching 'Philosophy in the local girls High Schools' programme.  I guess it's soooo competitive that the HIgh School students feel pressure to do anything anything anything in order to get a reference to go to any University at alll.  I mean, imagine how garbage everybody will think they must be if they fail out of a First Year Philsophy Advance Placement (yeah right) Ethics course that they are doing when they are at High School.  He mysteriously up and died so thehy didn't need to investigate.  Yeah, right.  WOnder what ALister Gunn formerly Ethics Professor (was he?) at the Univesrity of Waikato is up to or is doing now?  Probably persuading or convincing the world that this that and the other is all locally or regionally morally and ethically acceptable in fact compulsory in these parts.  Hey, let's get Tim Dare to write with various people to say that it's practically morally obligatory to target 'vulnerable children' for state care uplifts so that they can be better targeted by the known pedophiles and offenders who...  Pay the NZ government, do they?  Do they pay the government?  In order to commit atrocities against the people of NZ because it's all 'morally compulsory' that that kind of thing happen in these parts.  Write them all up as disabled degenerates who can't even read.  Right?  That must be right...  THey can't even fill out an application to enrol form.  THey no speak the English.  They can ask for one and none will be supplied.  All of the training places for the kiddies who bribe the university officials who bribe the university officials who bribe the 'university' officials.  Who apparently lack the capacity to process an application according with the published criterion.  Throwing the applicaitons away.  There is no alternative to the nasty degenerates that must be the ones specially handpicked to be on government payroll.  </p>

                                    <p>The University of Auckland says that the reports of external examiners are commissioned by and owned by the 'University'.  They say they are confidential and will not be shown to studnets. That is or means to say the Univesrity tells the students what the University wants to tell the studnents about whether or not they have 'done enough' for a PhD qualification.  THey are not making decisions on the basis of the examiners reports (one can only imagine that that is why the refuse to supply the reports to the studnets).  So they can tell the students that the examiners said this that and the other and the student doesn't have any choice but to believe them, hand over more and more nd more money for reenrollment and reenrollment and reenrollment, else limp away.  Never to get any employment to work in academia.  Right?  Slowest worker ever.  Right?  Can't even output the research output of a first year student for every year of PhD enrolment.  Right?  The 'Univesrities' of Australasia...  Where the brains go to be tasered to death.  Where researchsers go to be incapacitated handicapped disabled.  Decommissioned.  SO that we can listen to Sterelny go on about Dawkins selfish genes and about how we are busily breeding people to approximate cockroaches as much as possible. To withstand nuclear strike.  The great vision of humanity from the only people on Philosophy Payroll!  What humanity?  What people?  What vision?  What health?  What education?  Nothing to see...  NOthing nothing nothing at all.  What's that?  Taken over by psychopaths.  Grubby grub grub up all the money and all the titles and all the honors and all the qualificiations...  So everybody else can sit around all day going yes sir yes sir three bags full sir anything you say sir and take their shots on demand.  Vaccine or euthanasia.  It's all the same -- right?  Do what you are told when you are told because you are told.  Voluntarily and wllingly.  That's what voluntary means.  It mens you have been volunteered.  </p>

                                    <p>The Australaian Constitution states clearly that NZ is a State of Australia.  No election has been held such that the constitution has been changed and NZ's status as State rescinded.  There has not been an election to have NZ removed from it's position as being a State of Australia.  Australia will not supply Federal Election voting papers to NZers even though many of them were born in a state of Australia (that is to say NZ).  Australia will not process applications from NZers for certain things they consider 'high value'.  Australia chooses to treat NZ as an off-shore detention camp of Australia.  New Manus Island.  May was well be called.  Every now and then you see snippets to realise that that is the case.  For example, isn't it Australia who orders for however many NZ dollars to be printed in Canada?  Every now and then it becomes obvious that it is Australia really calling the shots on the way that things are done in NZ.  I guess the idea/l is to limit the movement of the people so that it is easier to re-deploy the offenders kept on government payroll.  Move the likes of Alister around.  Move the likes of Dr Leeks around.  Kim Sterelny.  Harlene Hayes.  Move the sh*t around.  People keep away from them as their reputations preceed them. The shit that was going to be expediated at Otago is going ot be expediated at Western Australia now?  Go commit atrocities on the aboriginal people, I would imagine or suppose.  Send your 18 year old psychopaths to go commit atrocities on the aboriginal people.  Nobody will listen or care if they complain about having been absued by people who..  Pay the government, pay teh government, pay the government, pay the government.  I suppose.  </p>

                                    <p>So, when some people from NZ get sick they get airlifted to Sydney.  That is another way in which it is obvious.  Nobody cares what happens to the NZ health system (nobody cares if there is not one at all) because they airlift some people out. Only the degenerates are left here.  That's the idea/l -- right?  For this to be, effectively, a prison camp  for degenerates.  Make it a beacon or a magnet by design.  See how much money people wil pay into the edu-tourism to come here and do anytyhing anything anything with impunity.  Right?  Where is the evidence to the contrary?  All the work that goes into undermining and stabotaging and preventing and prohibiting development.  All the work that goes into refusing to get theses out to exernals.  All the work that goes into refusing to proess applications.  Allt he work that goes into throwing applications away.  All the work that goes into bullying studnets into slaving and handing over their work.  All the work that goes into being a f*cking arsehole.  All the work that goes into ensuring there is litlte to no research ouptput and the only messaging they will listen to is 'there is no alternative to the selfish f*cking psychopaths'.  Cooperation did not evolve.  It didn't.  I don't see any co-operation -- do you?  Coorination in the ultimate goal of ruining things for us all lis not the same thing.  Not the same thing, at all.  ALl the work and energy and effort that goes into ensuring that there aren't ny people to see...  No people..  No peple...  No people.  NOhting of anyl meaning or value or purpose at all.  No knowledge.  No truth.  No education.  Justice.  University.  NOthing.  Nada.  Zip.  Zilch.  Zero.  Sort of Harry Harlow Primate Research Laboratory of Australasia.  How to  breed an underclass of degenerates.  Right?</p>

                                    <p>For example, Chris Cairnes?  Most esteemed cricketer, of New Zealand -- right?  What did they do to him?  Botched an aortic anuerism repair so as to render him paralysed.  Now they (people in Sydney) get how much money, to keep him, again?  How much money do they get for holding him every night that they hold him in some 'rehabiliation' facility.  WOrkign really hard at the prevention and prohibition of his ever walking again?  Wasn't that right?  Only the very very very best of the healthcare for the NZers.  That's what the very very best looks like?  In the race to the bottom, yeah right.  Not so very many years ago there was a report into the VC of Queensland knowing that his daughter was given enrolment in Medicine when she was not rank order scored high enough to receive a place (he was informed of that fact, and he knew it before she received her offer of enrolment).  She was enrolled.  There was some investigation and he was required to stand down.  Where has been re-deployed to, now?  Is he CE of the public hospital system so he can ensure she gets to be surgeon or whatever he wants her to  be regardless of the quality of her application?  Anyway...  It was after he resigned / after the inquiry saying that it was corrupt (but no prosecution would occur and they were happy to see her recorded as being a graduate of the programme - to really advertise why someone might want ot be VC even when tehy don't pay them to be VC, I suppose)...  Anyway...  It was after that that Chris Whelan was paid quarter of a million NZ dollars per year to refuse to process or progress any complaints of wrong-doing for any of hte 'Universities' of NZ.  </p>

                                    <p>I mean to say that the report of inquiry into misconduct of the University of Queensland had the function (perhaps aim or goal) of advertising to the world that it might be desirable to be VC of an Australasian University (even if they don't pay you -- even if you pay them) so that your children can be given enrolment into and graduation from the Medical School of the fine institution.  THe only consequence is that you may  nee to step down.  Which, if you are paying them in order to do anything anything anything you like means that you stop paying them is all it mens.  It wasn't like they actually paid yuo anything anyway.  Right?  Isn't that the main draw for Austaralasia?  How corruptu things are, here, where people from the Northern Hemisphere come here and do anyting anyting they likfe for super special cheap with impunity?  I mean...  The legal system refuses to prosecute corruption and refuses to find in the interests of justice...  Things have gotten worse, now, since then.  I suppose that was because the funciton of the report was to advertise Australasian Universities as being fundamentally corrupt where the Judiciary was, effectively, promising never to find such pratices corrupt.</p>

                                    <p>So...  What rehabiliation programme in Sydney?  I don't know how much money some people paid in order to get to do anything anytihng anything to the cricket guy for a while.  QUite a few kids like to experiment on gettin gin there and having a go doing operations on young athletes.  So pretty.  I supose the NZ rugby girls would be n obvious target.  They know what happens in sports involving repeated head concussin.  Therefore we must withhold helmets and put force plates into their teeth and document the head trauma resulting from being beaten about the head repeatedly in the name of national sport.  There will be reparation for hte athletes?  THey look out for or after their healtlhcare.  Right?  I don't know..  Check Olivia's health records.  To see the healthcare she was provided while she was int eh state care institution of cycling NZ.  If she was suicidal there probably would be expected to be some record.  It is strange indeed to think that she would voluntarily kill herself just when it appearedt hat things were going to change for the better within cycling NZ.  (Yeah right. Justice it's in the bag with Toogooe was appointed to cover up yet another wrongful death in state care.  He apparently couldn't access the University internet records to see when Mason disappeared from being online to pinpoint his time of death.  Notn possible to see who was AV recorded as having left his room around that time.  Course not).  Are we more corrupt than South Africa?  Apparently people pay however much to come here from South Africa and have their wives indefinately detained in Hillmorton.  That's how corrupt we are.  Does not make any sense -- right?  What a f*cking farce.</p>

                                    <p>We have discovered the nature of good, in psychopath-land.  See, it actually turns out that it is evil.  'Law' is a thing or a mechanism that the government uses with which to persectute the people.  The Government accuses civilians (like Tamaki) of being a threat to the government (since people might vote for him) so he gets prophylactically imprisoned for his crimes against the government.  That's what law is for.  Just so you know.  Want to know the point or purpose of the 'education' or 'health' system?  The (prevention and prohibition of) justice or health or work and income?  All the things...  In upside down and back to front land.  Inside out land.  Psychopath-land.  They won't publically advertise jobs.  They won't properly progress or process applications for the jobs (they throw them away for no good reason and give them to people on grounds of their being racist psychopathic arseholes) they won't pay the workers.  They won't acknowledge the work that's been done.  They won't pay the workers.  They use the courts to heap abuse upon those who have already been wronged.  To teach the people a little lesson in how the ministry of injustice and the judiciary (judges hauled out of retirement and not even appointed by proper process) think that the point purpose and function of their job is to compound injustice for the good of...  Uh, for the good of, uh..  I don't know.  Maybe Justice Toogood thinks he'll be airlifted to Sydney, or something, if he gets sick.  Or maybe he just doesn't think.  I have no f*cking idea what the hell he is thinking.  If he even writes his own judgmeents, which there really is no reason to believe that he does.  Likely the interns write the judgments.  Right?  Before they ship them off to be sexually molested in the firms...   No, they had to show their willingess to shut the f*ck up about that before they would hire them as interns for the High Court Judges.  Of course.  What social services?  What government?  What's that Jacinda?  Everyone cheats on their election donations?  Because why?  Becuase none of the people currently in power would be in power if they hadn't have cheated.  Right.  Good to know.  How much did Harvard pay you to say that to the camera?  I guess if they photoshopped it...  Uh...  What are you going to do about it?  </p>

                                    <p>All the work that I did while I was enrolled in the PhD programme of the Australian National University.  The University has records kept that appear to say that everything was on track and they expected me to have converted my draft into something that would go to examiners in 3 months.  Now, what evidence is it that anybody from the ANU told that to me?  What evidence is there that they told me anything at all?  What evidence is there of them setting me readings,  having meetings with me, telling me about what they thought of the state of my progress?  In person meetings...  One or two or three?  Maybe?  Me going to morning tea is not a supervision meeting.  What the hell are they on payroll for?  Is it my job to chase them?  Whose job was it to supervise me?  They are paid to do what, now?  I am paid to write a thesis, I believe.  I wrote them a thesis.  The least they can do (the absolute least) is get the f*cking work to the external examiners.  Did I submit it in soft-copy?  No I did not.  Did they give me a date that I needed to do that?  What happened with ALL THE OTHER STUDENTS.  The were supplied dates by their supervisor -- right?  Their supervisor said that they should or could submit it on a certain date.  I'm still waiting...  F*cking yeah, right.  Not a University at all.  Apparently it's not their job to chase me.  They didn't need to chase me.  Sending me a f*cking email saying 'you need to submit it in softbound on x date in order to complete in a timely fashion' is not chasing me.  Information.  F*cking psychopath.</p>

                                    <p>And really the worst of it is how they are choosing to act or respond to things NOW.  That's the worst of it.  When I bring this to the attention of the adminstration particularly and they instruct me to submit complaint after comlaint after complaint sayign that my complaint doeson't count as a complaint and I need to revise and resubmit my complaint because they don't acknoweldge receipt of my complaint.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                                    <p>I guess they think it doesn't matter because nobody listens to me.  Because they will still get more applicants than they want to offer enrolment to.  They are still getting pretty girls, maybe, so they can parade them in their party frocks to the tourists.  They are still getting people paying a bunch of money to visit Australia from the US.  Still getting a bunch of students, even, investing in visiting for a while for the tourist dollars.  Of course.  That's what university is about.  That's why it's such an academically stimulating environment (yeah right) so people can hear the psychopaths preech their version of psychopathy.  The only game in town.  The only thing the governmetn will fund.  Philsoophy is just second rate science for all the people too stupid to do science.  Right?  So they can sign off on the acceptability of all the animal torture and people torture experiments because people are just peculiar primates.  Right?  Who should be kept in conditions of love.  Right Harry Harlow?  What's that?  YOur research doens't have in vivo real world  applicability . Well, then best get busy busy busy with the social engineering to bring your primate research lab to life!  Just think of all the things we are learning from Professor Glue's Glue Factory!  Don't worry about Psychiatry, they are focused on further incapaciating only the lowest of the lowest of the lowest of the low.  Right?  Not the likes of you or me!  First they came for the x and I did nothing because I was not x..  And then they came for...  Just imagine the 'must haves' who must be the only game in town for getting on board with the projects for the incapacitation and disablement of the population of NZ.  People who were born here, though not fault of their own.  The only game in town.  There is non alternative.</p>

                                    <p>I guess, to be fair, that appointing Ashley Bloomfield...  Sir..  Saint (I forgot that one).  Lord.  Master.  Doctor.  Judge.  That will be next -- right?  Appointing someone who is marketed or con-municated as being respectable and honest and...  Not 'just doing his job' but, 'just  being himself' apparently...  The ideology behind it, I suppose, will be to do with the international students who paid a lot of money to do Health Science First Year at the Univesrity of Auckland.  At least, they used to.  In fact, more than that.  Some people's parents paid a bunch of money for them to come to NZ as Secondary Students.  Even Primary Students.  Right?  As young as 7?  Was it?  To be kept in NZ educational institutions or facilities...  In the hope they might be proclaimed 'doctor' and make a living wage.  Maybe so their family can immigrate to NZ and the doctors wage can support the whole family.  Whatever.  Anyway, point is or was that it wasn't very good...  Marketing.  It wasn't a very good con-munication from NZ to see how obviously low-value the Public or Population Health 'pathway' (shall we call it) to Medicine was...  So I suppose it's some kind or sort of attempt to..  Market... I suppose...  The programme to international students.  So that they are okay about their children being enrolled in that one and not being enrolled in MBChB.  I mean, if all you seek is to have as much power over individuals to do anything anything anything then unlawfully ordering the entire country into a state of prison (stay home detention) would be pretty high up there.  Right?  Don't you think (hope) that future generations will look back on this time and go 'how or why could that possibly have happened?  How the hell is it that the government of NZ could scaremonger the people into just staying home one day...  And staying there for how much into the indefinate future?  Because the con-munications from overseas were that people were dying from a virus that we didn't know much about.  What reason was there, actually, to beleive any of that.  Body bags were being piled up in the streets.  Yes.  But people usually do die...  What was different?  Carryign capacity was exceeded.  Like what happens t othe chickens etc when you keep them too many to a free rnge cage nd they start pecking each other to death.  The governments.  I suppose.  </p>

                                    <p>I suppose it is actually the case that I have the largest studnet loan of anybody in this entire country.  It's supposed to serve as a lesson to everybody in New Zealand, maybe even the entire world about how there aren't Universities.  There are prison slave detention camps.  They aren't getting the students work out to external examiners so that it can be examined on it's academic merits.  They aren't grading work properly.  And now I'm supposed to conveniently vanish or disapper. Since I am the (presntly anyway) living evidence of their crimes.  That they chose to do that to me.  That they chose to encourage me only in things that were supposed to set me up to fail.  I asked people about my research projects -- they could have been directive about what I was working on with my independent research.  They chose to encourage me to do the research that I did.  The topics that I worked on.  You can see on the writing page how Justine Kingsbury encouraged me to do a project on 'disability and equity in medicine and public health' (basically concluding that there wasn't anhy equity and 'disability' was used as an excuse for treating people poorly so the idea of refrainign from discriminating against didn't even make any sense when the whole point of the label was to stigmatise).  Kim Sterelny was my supervisor for how many years?  For how many years in Australia?  HOw many years?  They won't supervise me.  Okay.  They wont' get my work to external examiners.  They won't allow externals to sign off on qualification completions.  They won't allow me to apply for employment or jobs that require those qualifications.  They won't acknowledge that I have finished being a student of Philosophy.  How many years to expertise, was it?  While they collect up all the money all the money all the money.  So, how much research does Justine Kingsbury output, then, for every year that she has been on payroll with the Univesrity of Waikato?  I offered to jointly get an article based on my Masters to a journal for publication...  I could work on it with her for a couple months over the summer after I finished my Masters.  But turns out she'd rather have me failed out of the University and have no research outupts at all.  The aim or the goal or the purpose or the point of the Univesriteis.  It seems.  TO have no research outputs at all.  Just put the work into a dungeon of some kind and bully the studnets into fleeing. T here's nothing there. </p>

                                    <p>So the whole point the aim the purpose the goal is to keep Stanford Prison types of 'experiments' (actually observational studies) or keeping people as poorly as possible.  Bullying and abusing.  Why?  Why not!!!  When you are getting away with it, why the hell not!  THe Prisons and the Schools and the Universities and the Hospitals and so on and so forth.  The aim the goal the purpose or the point. To keep as many people as badly and poorly as possible.  To cry and cry and cry for more and more and more money so you can treat more and morea nd more people worse and worse and worse.  Who will be picked to lead these camps!!!  Who will be picked to be paid and paid and paid to commit these atrocities?  Who will be on government payroll!!!  Now you can simply redeploy all the government workers from one prison or detention camp to another.  It's all the same.  Doesn't matter whether they trained in or worked in the prisons schools quarantine facilities hospitals.  It's all the same.  Right Chris?  It's all the same.  You record that people are owing money.  You record that they are stupid.  They are disabled.  They are morally reprehensible.  They are bad and they are mad and they are poor and they are disabled.  Not in the way that anybody will feel empathy.  But in the nasty degenerate 'just die alrady' kind of a way.  As many people as poorly as possible.  Right?  The whole 'how low can we go' programme. The prevention and prohbition of social and economic and everthing else of any value or worth development programme. The race to the bottom.  </p>

                                    <p>What research ouptuts?</p>

                                    <p>What 'helping'?  Seriously?  The 'helping me helping me helping me help myself to you' programme?  Was it?  </p>

                                    <p>Apparently there are engineering graduates.  Are there jobs for engineers?  I suppose there is never any shorage for the need for deep pits where to bury the bodies, and the like.  Buildings to house the people kept in detention.  Another slum.  Another not fit for purpose prison camp (school, hospital) intentionally designed to be not fit by and for design.  </p>

                                    <p>For how long are people supposed to beleive that they are just really really really bad at being good?  Before you see that they are perhaps really really really good at  being bad?</p>

                                    <p>When a normal person hears 'privacy' they think about privacy meaning something along the lines of..  Being able to..  I don't know.  Pick ones nose.  Discretely.  That is to say, without ones doing so being something that other people see them do.  Having privacy.  Closing the door and thinking that what you do behind closed doors is private.  Not because you are raping 20 virgins who you blackbirded to be given to Chris Whelan or Ashley Bloomfield in exchange for them signing off on completion of study for some other student from that nation..  But privacy to do mundane or trival things that would cause embarrassment or similar were they to be made public.  The standard example, is doing things like picking your nose.  The thought is that everybody needs to clear crap out of their nose every now and then (so everyone can relate to the need to do that) and most people have a sense of decorum or similar such that they would prefer to do such things in private.</p>

                                    <p>The New Zealand Government also Law does not have that conception of privacy.  They think that privacy is when the Government withholds records about a person from that person.  So, for example, the New Zealand Government keeps records whereby I owe the NZ Government....  What is it?  Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars that they have loaned me so I could invest in my education...  THe thought that it would be a good financial thing for them to do.  To record levels of debt against my name that I borrowed to give to the Universities of NZ in the form of fees (I didn't spend that on my own personal stuff.  I spend course related costs on text-books and computer items for writing and printing assignments I kept records of what I spend my course related costs money on always because I knew it was auditable).  THey also gave the Universities (apparently) more money up front or out right for having recorded me as haivng been enrolled than they ever recorded agaist my name.  I mean to say I have brought thae Univesrities of NZ how much money over the years?  Money that they kept getting kept getting kept getting for having me.  While they record me as... Well...  They are happly to write me up as 'first in class' until they realise they will get even more money if they write that they failed me for essays because they tink I'm not literate anymore.  Apparently.  They have the authority to decide what they want and I must be required to do anything anything anything .  I should go to an in person meeting so they can explain to me why they are withholding passing grades from me because they collect more nd more nd more and more and more money for kepeing me enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled.  ANd they don't have any research outputs to speak of.  And mine are hidden away.  Handed to others?  To pass off as their own?  To be whitewashed and presented by armies of government employees?  </p>

                                    <p>Anyway...  The point is..  Cry cry cry about how 'free software companies' are violating NZ childrens privacy by having information about the children.  But the NZ government does not think that NZ children have the right to privacy.  They don't think that they have the right to not  be molested in the schools.  They don't have the right to that kind of privacy.  They don't hav ethe right to the content of their examinations being private or confidential to internal -- so internal hands the content (unaltered) over to external examiners.  They don't beleive that the studnet has privacy in their submissions for examination.  THey don't believe that the student has privacy at all.  They don't believe that the reports of examiners are reports about the studnets work tkhat should go to the studnets.  Between the exteranal examiners and what they are saying the studnet needs to do before the external will sign off.  They think that privacy is when the slavers keep records about their slaves and the records about the slaves are private to the slavers and not viewable by the slaves.  Not alterable in light that they have kept are choosing to keep false records. </p>

                                    <p>See..  It will be obvious to international community that various people in NZ can read and so on.  That they can do academics.  But the NZ government has written them up as degenerate criminal illiterates etc etc.  So as to, you know, give all the governmetn jobs to the bullies and abusers and so on.</p>

                                    <p>F*cking Weltec.  What happened?  Oh, don't worry about her.  What's that?  The only people who don't get 1 year level 5 certificates from Weltec are the hopeless degenerates.  The ones with abosolutely no reading writing or arithmetic.  The ones with no ability to turn up to school on time.  The ones with no ability to folow basic instructions.  The ones with no ability to do any reading or any maths of the most basic level at all.  Don't worry about her.  Don't worry abotu failing her.  Don't worry about recording that she failed.  Don't worry about her.  All this extra money to hire people to go chase up the studnets who aren't in class (to drive them to class) so they don't fail those studnets out.  Don't worry about failing her out.  We gave her a first in class for physiology so that means we will record that she failed the entire qualification hahahahhahaha.  Guess she'll jlsut need to reenroll and reenroll and reenroll nd reenroll and be reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled.   I mean, oh me oh my if we passed the likes of her then we would need to pass everyone and then the qualification would mean nothing.  Rawk rawk rawk scream the f*cking vultures.</p>

                                    <p>It isn't tall poppy syndrome.  I don't know what it is.  That people get it into their heads that it's so f*ckign fun for htem to be such f*cking arseholes to me.</p>

                                    <p>When I was at primary school (I was a kid, it's not my f*cking fault) they made an executive decision to year advance me with around 4 or something other kids.  Then they put us with a teacher who is mean (compared to the other teacher who did not have the year advance class).  So I got Mrs Pilcher who was a mean b*tch.  I was the only kid in the class who didn't get to play sport because I wasn't 7 yet.  She spent all year telling me that I shouldn't be in her class.  Etc.  Because she didn't believe in year advance.  Therefore I mustn't have any social skills.  And if that meant she publically mocked me and so on so that the kids learned from her that that was how to treat me then that was what she was going to do to drive her point home.  Miss Dobbs had the rest of my hear cohort and she was lovely.  Then Mr Ashby who they ended up having to let go because he would slam 1 m rulers down on people's desks so as to make everybody too wound-up and anxious to do maths.  He missed one day and actually hit a kids fingers very hard so he had to be deployed to who knows where.  Instead of Mrs Rosemergy who was lovely.  Then Mrs Howe.  Who was also a mean b*tch.  My desk was messy.  Instead of her helping me keep it cleaner (mostly by encouraging me to focus on putting things away tidily instead of being focused on getting things ready for the next activity) she decided to make a public example of me by having me keep my stuff in an open box.  Kids would throw rubbish in there and she would find this very amusing.  She took great delight in telling me that she found me to be unsettled in her class therefore she woudl hold me back for another year and I would be with her for another year.  </p>

                                    <p>I remember being very very very very upset about that.  It was the first I had heard of my going to intermediate a year early (I didn't know that the school was actually contemplating that and that that was the purpose or point of the advance placement).  But the other stndard 4 teacher was Mr Ussher who everybody liked a lot.  I really really really liked him because I respected him because he seemed to me to be tough but fair.  So he would enforce meaningful consequences for people when they were talking while he was instructing and so on.  ANd he was knowledgeable and kind and so on.  I was very very upset about not wanting to spend another year with Mrs Howe b*tch woman.  So instead I was placed in his class.  But then I was required to do an extension class every week with his wife who was a b*tch.  I remember doing worthless extesion activities like writing our name in big bold and coloring it in.  Just stup*d shit.  Taking a few of us out of the standard curriculum class.  While..  What?  The other kids did math or something, I suppose.</p>

                                    <p>New Zealand schools.  Right?  I remember the district inspectors visiting.  I remember Mrs Howes class, actually when they asked about if we knew how popcorn was discovered or invented.  I actually did know.  They were very disappointed that I stole their thunder.  They asked how I knew and I said I read it in an encyclopedia.  Which I had.  My Mother had kids encyclopedias at home.  SO when I asked questions we could look them up.  And the entries were kind of interesting so I read more widely and I remember reading abou that one.  Mr Ussher would also let me in the room with the reading comprehension cards.  So I could read those...  The reading comprehension level assessment tests.  Because I liked reading the stories.  I remember there were stories about Marie Currie and all kinds of things.  They were well written and clear and so on.</p>

                                    <p>So, of course, that's a great reason to keep me poorly so I can slave and slave and slave and slave for no credit.  SO the people chosen picked out to be district inspectors (don't worry about her she'll be okay) can ensure that I get failed out of Weltec (don't worry abotu her she'll be okay) and not get my work to externals.  Just stay with Mrs Howe forever so she can keep your things as the public rubbish heap.  Right?  That'll teach her to..  Teach me to what, exactly?  That will teach me what?  What am I supposed to do?  Get better at keeping my head down and blending in.  Nobody ever helped me do that.  THey just publically mocked me.  Really.  That's my problem then.  The incredibly toxic envrionment.  Yeah.</p>

                                    <p>Dspite that I have had really great friends in my life, at times, over the years.  And I read..  I can lean vicariously quite a lot of how things go and what sorts of things people can do whewn tehy don't find themselves targeted in susch incredibly toxic enviornments.</p>

                                    <p>There will be no psychiatry in NZ for teh same reason tehre will be no medicine, no surgery,  no education, no law, nothing nothing nothing.  There will be nothing at all.  There's nothing here.  Nothing to see.  Just a dream land for pedophile rapist bully abusers.  Why is NZ called the land of the long white cloud?  Because people like to try and cover up their..  MIstakes?  Yeah.  That's right.  All I am is a unsightly reminder of everything wrong.  I guess.  Just waiting for them to murder me off now.  Right?  I mean...  THey don't publicaly advertise jobs.  They aren't interested in hiring the person with the relevant experience or qualifiations or whatever.  They are interested in hiring..  What?  Someone to make them feel better about themselves.  Mmmmm.  Yeeeees.  I seeee.  You must be right.  Mmmmmm.  Big eyes.  Of course.  Yes.  You are so clever.  Oh no, I dind't know that.  Sure.  Of course.  Yes sir.  Yes sir.  Three bags sir.  Of course.  Yes god.  I worship you almighty Ashley.  Of course my Lord and Saviour.</p>

                                    <p>Oh, what's the problem?  You think that I think that I know everything and other people don't have anything to teach me.  But then you think that I don't know anytihng and I won't ask for help.  I ask for help and the problem is that I need help.  I don't ask for help and the problem is that I don't ask for help.  The problem is that...  Yeah.  The problem mis the toxic environment.  The problem is the person-environment mis-match.  Right..  So then it would be great if I could be placed with other peple who I fit with.  No?  It's more fun if I am forced to be with Mrs Pilcher and Ashby and Howe...  It would be better if I was in an environment I wa sa better fit with.  I guess the inspector people and the piont of the PTA testing and the like was to identify people who might do well in private school?  See about academic scholarships and the like?  Instead of me having advance placemetn classes with Mrs Ussher wehre I learn to write my name really large in block capitals and we talk about our use of color.  Toxic environment.  For sure.</p>

                                    <p>Why didn't my mother take me out, then?  Put me in private school?  She could have afforded it.  Well...  Why would you think they would treat the kids any  better?  Do we treat our international studnets any better than we treat the local scum?  No.  We do not.  They just take the money nd scummy scam them over just the same, so far as I can tell.  I don't see them working on honesty or integrity.  Even if you pay the bribes I don't see any readson to think that will help.  I mean to say..  The Univeriteis havecolleceed up how much money for keeping me (while refusing to acknoweldge my qualifiations now) for how long?  I don't think that the money is serving the purpose of having them sign off on the studnets...  Apparently I'm supposed to be dead.  That's the trouble or the problem.  Once I've stopped earning them money then I'm supposed to die now.  Noo....  I'm a slave to the courts?  I can file and file and file and file and file.. So the judges can pick and choose the bits that they like from what I say and write that into their judgement and people can do 'oh me oh my quite the eloquence of Lord Denning!'  ist hat he idea/l now?  Do you like the things I say now?  Now that that seems to be what the ideaology for me is.  That I can just have all my stuff approopriated by others.  Alll of the money and power and glory and rewards for htem and theirs forever and ever and ever amen.!!!</p>

                                    <p>The right to be forgotten..  I see..  We forgot that we had PhD graduates when we gave Lord Ashley his Professorship.  We forgot we had people who had done the work for a PhD before we gave him his Professorship.  That's right Lord Ashley had the right to have everyody else forgotten so that there's nothign left to be done but sing the praises of Lord Ashley.  At least the University of Auckland doesnt' need to wait for studnets to apply, now, before recording that they are enrolled in Lord Ashley's Degree Programme.  They can invoice the Government for them keeping however many studnets enrolled in that programme (what's to stop them enrolling the entire population of NZ in that programme and them collecting up more and more and more money for recording the reenrolment nd rereenrollment and rerereenrollment in that programme).  They could just say that teh entire population of NZ doesn't have the willingness or ability to do anything anything Ashley says when he says because he says.  They all failed the programme they were enrolled in.  They had been voluntarily consented to having been enrolled in.  All voluntary-like.  Unemployable therefore.  Don't worry they have the right to be forgotten.  Non-person.  NO passports or birth certificates.  Didn't you know that the Doctor was it?  Ashley? Maybe Lord Ashley can simply choose to change your assigned gender at birth?  They get to choose your assigned gender now, didn't  you know?  Of course, they were always exercising that power.  Dr Leeks and all that.  They wanted the boys to be pimped out as girls for the people who were that way inclined.  That way they didn't have to worry about them being inpregnated, I suppose.  Before they realised or leaned there was more money in the harvesting of foetal tissue and organs and entire people, really.  I would imagine or suppose.  That way you dont' even need to pay them.  Right?  You can wait for them to pay you with the proceeds of their crimes.</p>

                                    <p>I mean, here's an idea...  If the trouble with my research is that the politicans are psychopaths, really, so you need to intentionally make your research seem like a meaningless waste of time (make your applications seem indistinguishable from the outputs of the post-modernist essay generator in order to receive research funding at all) then tell me that.  Say, hey, instead of working on things in philosophy of psychiatry why not working in something in merology or metphysics?  Write about types and tokens and functions and get it done very quickly before anybody discovers you have a social conscience'.  Yeah.  Too late.  Cat out of bag.  Now off to the gas chamber with you, already...  Well, if they need people to be psychopaths..  Then maybe they will wnat to hear that good is evil and justice is injustice nad privacy is telling everyone your slaves are disabled incapacitated mad bad wicked stupid black women impoverished unclass degenerates.  See, up is down and in is out and left is right and garbage garbage garbge.  I fell on my head repeatedly over the last year or two or three.  Didnt' you know?  Must have.  The speak english all fell out.  Absolutely.  My work is clearly teh outputs of the postmodernist essay generator and Lord Ashley is soooo clever at reading teleprompts.  Don't worry..  You don't get made Lord by doing your job (the job for which you are paid) rather, it's all very very very very personall.  Because they saw into the heart of his soul the very heart of his being and once they heard him read the teleprompt they decided that their complete duty was to totally forget about everybody else.</p>

                                    <p>They publically published selection criterion for the purposes of their accountabilty.  ANd they choose to proclaim to the world that they are not making decisions in accordacne with their published algorithm dnt ehy are not being accountble for the decicsions they are making.  They are making the decisions on personal grounds.  They are not behaving or acting with ny honesty or integrity or fairness at all.  There is nohting in NZ.  No healath system no education no judiciary.  There is nothing.  They refuse to allow there to be anytyhing.  I guess trying to breed slave degenerates for the first world.  Our government won't seem to allow things to be any other way.  There is no alternative.</p>

                                    <p>So, hahahahaha that there would actually be any help for the kids who are having a hard time.  For the people in environments they don't mesh or gel or fit with.  There won't be any counselling or psychiatry.  Of, if there is, I can already tell that the only people who the government will allow to work with the likes of me will be Pilcher and Ashby and Howe.  Once it is identified that certain people are able to help certain other people then they must be removed.  Every time.  Because the aim or the purpose or the goal was to teach me from a very very very young age that I did not fit, I did not belong, all of the everything for for other people other people other people.  I stood out like a sore thumb (I was a f*cking child) and it's never stopped.  Right?  That was my MOther's lot in life as well -- right?  I don't know...  Why wasn't there a job for her?  She started nursing training...  Look at all the degenerates they intentionally choose to hire to give babies away and murder babies and the like...  Why she wasn't able to complete her nursing training and go on and into and do that... Why there was no job for her.  No employment for her, in NZ.  Why the other mohters were so horrible to her.  Such a f*cking b*tch.  Why they would say 'stop worrying about looking so pretty and *ride*' when they actually were being paid to teach me...  Why they never would teach me anything...  Don't worry about her, she'll be okay...  When actually something was off about my posture and I needed some genuine help.  They didn't know.  Okay.  Other people did.  But those other people are never allowed to help me...  Right?</p>

                                    <p>Whenever I did work well with someone in the  healtlh system they left.  I don't know that they applied to leave or they were re-deployed.  SO that f*cking bad fit people would be forced to work with me.  I guess it's about how you get people to shut up about things.  If you don't wnt Professor Glue's Professional Glue Factory to Turn your Brain to Glue then you learn to shut the f*ck up and stay the hell away.  There is no Psychiatry in NZ.  Only treat the involuntary nonvoluntry.  Leading the volunteers off to the gas chambers all voluntary.  How you have to treat people to get them volunteering for their suicide progrmme.  What a f*cking farce.  Not even trying.  Won't even allow people to tray.  Not trying to develop.  Not developing.  Throwing the applications away.  Throwing the applications awway.  Everybody else had the right to be forgotten. All of the everything fro Dr Leeks.  All of the monuments and awards in his honor.  He gets to choose the next generation and train tehm.  All nd only Dr Leeks 2.0 will ever be cknowledged as having applied.  What a f*cking joke of a farce-land.</p>

                                    <p>I wrote my MA at the University of Waikato when I was doing DBT.  Dialectical Behavior Therapy.  It was a new treatment for psychology in NZ.  It was being run as a pilot trial, actually.  In order to qualify for DBT (pilot trial) you needed to be diagnosed with 'Borderline Personality Disorder'.  If you did notn quality for DBT then the treatment you were offered was:  Nothing.  No treatment, at all.  The control group.  Nothing.  The only way to (possibly potentially actually) have psychotherapy, in NZ, in the proximity of a 'teaching clinic' (Univesrity of Waikato had a Clinical Psychology Training Programme) was to be:  Firstly:  Diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder.  Otherwise, you only had the standard Cognitive Behavior Therapy.  FOr anxiety or depression.  You needed to be sick (you are not sick enough) not too sick (you are in hospital therefore too sick) not sick enoguh (you are out of hospital therefore not sick enough). To, uh, learn about how 'activity scheduling' (aka act your way into feeling different.  Smile.  that's what happy means.) And fixing your cognitive distortions (tell me what you think?  Bad!  Wrong!  Tell yourself 'I loves me' in the mirror 5x per day therefore everything A:  OK!)...  So, uh, in order to get 'revolutionary' treatmetn from NZ...  Borderline Personality Disorder.  Hmmm.  Really?  To get treatemtn this is what I must do?  To get to talk to a psychotherapist in NZ?  Really?</p>

                                    <p>Firstly..  Self Harm.  You need to have documented that.  Really?  To get treatment?  To be considered bad enough?  (Now I realise I had it lucky.  Many were told they needed to have a court order from having being accused of crimes.  Many were told they needed to have been actually imprisoned and they would get help or treatment they themselves were asking for, they knew they needed...  Only if they were imprisoned of a crime..  At which point they were told they wouldn't quality until release...  I see now.  The great lie...  The great lie..  Anyway..  In the basis of this information...  I cut / burned myself.  To present evidence of how much I wanted treatment.  I mean...  Yeah.  That's the truth of it.  What I was thinking at the time.  Maybe DBT would be the treatment that would help me...  Cope with teh Mrs Pilcher and Ashby and Howes of this world.  (Since Miss Dobbs and Rosemergy and Ussher were not really allowed to work with me...)  Various other people had set their sights...</p>

                                    <p>Yeah.  So.  I would really like to be able to help the little-me's out there...  Not just me.. I know from AA and NA and so on...  Often (sometimes at least) people with history..  Use their position to incessantly recount their history in ways that are also not helpful.  But I wanted to be an alternative.  For the people who were helped my me.  Where I would refer on (and not try and keep) people who needed to be matched with someone else (it's notn personal).</p>

                                    <p>I sort of got to do DBT.  Firstly they put me in the control group.  Told me I was 'treatment as usual or normal'.  I presented the letter from the DHB saying no treatment was going to be offered to me.  I said that was unethica.  They were refusing treatment to people in the control group.  There was international evidence that DBT was effective.  They were effectively torturing people placed in control group.  They said they didn't have the resources to offer 1 year of the program.  They could offer 9 months only (1 academic year) and I would be treated by someone in training who was only there for 1 academic year.  I did that and it was really helpful.  Then at the end of 9 months I was told I was working with someone else that they chose to employ full time...</p>

                                    <p>I was not a good fit or match with the person they chose to hire full time.  A recent graduate of Otago.  I got on very well with the studnet in training (I learned subsequently she was a PhD history Graduate there was no job in history so she transferred into clinical psychology)...  She was older...  Probably ideally would have been history academic.  But no jobs.  We fit quite well.  Narrative sort of therapy allowed within the DBT scope.  Anyway..  New hire.. Recent graduate from Otago..  She was...  She was pretty.  She was young.  She was trying to be presenting herself as clever and pretty and bubbly and fun and likeable..  Maybe to be a sister??  I needed someone with the strength to handle things that I wasn't strong enough to be able to cope or deal with.  I didn't need social pressure to be a happy face for her and help her feel even better about her being paid however much she was paid with her shiny new job as Clinical Psychologist for the DHB.  It was not a good fit.  It was not a good fit.  It was not a good fit.  It wasn't personal...  But it was a fact..  And there wasn't anybody else.  Because they choose to under-staff.  Because they chose to staff for the masses or majority and they don't have an eye to requirements of a significnt class of outliers or similar.  Anyway...  She ended up writing in my notes something to the effect of she couldn't help me therefore she recommended nobody help me.  No treatment.  Treatment only makes me worse.  Cut me from service entirely.  So then I did try and kill myself.  No hope, you see.</p>

                                    <p>I see that now she's very very very very high up in teh administration.  Psychology for the prisons, even.  I suppose because of her willingness, now, subsequently, since, to write people up as 'I can't help them (not a good match) therefore I recommend no help for them'.  That is or means to say they keep her on payroll to write up how nobody should have any psychological treatment can't treat don't treat.  So the governmetn pays her how much?  To withhold psychology treatment services for people held in prisons nd psych instituions.  While telling others that they are not sick or bad enough for treatment.  See?  See?  See how it is not allowed to work?  It doesn't work?  It won't work?  </p>

                                    <p>I do have empathy for her...  But we were not a good fit.  It really wasn't personal.  I didn't need her to harden up...  Be a mean bitch or anything.  But she was how old?  Picked young young young and they trained her up the way they did and she's..  I don't know what she is now.  Well, I do.  Paid a lot of money to write up how they don't need to pay anybody other than her to write up reports about how no psychology treatment for anybody.  They only need to opay her (in the name of psychology) and they never need pay any other psychologist.  The entire psychology budget for her to withhold treatment for everybody!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

                                    <p>See, when you read something like 'Brave New World' and you understand that NZ basically does the experiments that the ethics boards of everywhere else couldn't approve (and the bar on what the ethics boards approve everywhere in the world really couldn't be much of any lower...)...  You are supposed to..  What?  Empathise with the story-teller? But why do that?  You want to be an alpha baby.  Right?  You think that in a land like this... You could pass yourself off as an alpha baby.  Right?  That's all it means to be an alpha baby in that kind or sort of land.  To read the tele-prompt that would be given to an alpha baby and then not deviate from that script.  Right?  Most desirable state of affairs.  Who keeps the scripts?  Anything anything anything anything.  Yes sir.  Yes sir.  Three bags full, sir.  NOt sure who Ahley Bloomfield's wife is.  Who is gunning for him, clearly . The way that Chris Hipkins Mummy is gunning for him...</p>

                                    <p>After a health scare in Auckland Central..  People flee to the long arm of medical care...  Indeed.  How to get the people to disperse to lands where there are no doctors.  Where there are no schools.  Where there are no roads.  No social services.  No expecttions of social services.  No employment... NO jobs.  NOthing nothing nothing at all.  It isn't like there are social services for the people on the payroll.  On the payroll only to ensure and enforce no delivery of any of the social services.  No  healthcare.  No justice.  Nothing.  Nothing.  NOthing.  NOthing.  NOthing.  Nada.  Zip.  Zilch.  Zero.  Nothing nothing nothing.  Nothing nothing.  Nothing to be seen.. NOthing nohting nothing at all...</p>

                                    <p>Rawgh.  I mighty psychologist!  I get paid 9xFTE position to write 9x patient notes.  I say in patient notes 'I in my clinical psychology opinion reccommend no psychology treatment for you'.  Then I can collect 9x psychology job moneies for delivery of no treatment.  That's in your best interests.  9x FTE psychology positions for me.  No treatement for you.  But what's in it for the NZ Government?  I know...  We pay you for 6x FTE Psychology positions to 'handle' or 'manage' 9x the caseload.  But why stop there?  Why not pay you 3x the standard for 9x the caseload?  But why stop there?  Why you not pay the university pay the university pay the university record levels of debt against your name only while you handle 9x the FTE psychology caseload?  How could we be more pscyhoptic?  True question.  Really...  Further or future research will tells us...  How can we be mooooooore psychopathic..??  Only game in town...</p>

                                    <p>Well..  I know.  The entire country should RIP because Lord God Almighty Saviour Judge on HIgh Ashley shall take Allllllllll of the moneies for the FTE Of the entire nation!!!! That's just brilliant!! Everyone else can just be recorded by the NZ government as owing the NZ government moneies for having been all voluntary-life volunteered by the Government for being enrolled in the course of how to be Lord Almighty God and Saviour Ashley Bloomfield course in the 2 year Masters of Everything qualification!!! Graduation ceremony scheduled for never!! Oh my!!! What a lark!!!</p>

                                    <p>I imagine that it's a truly glorious day!!  When the elite esteemed leaders of NZ can take visitors from Harvard or elite esteemed political positions in the US or the UK, the King of England, and show them the kumara patch that the allow the Maaori of Northland to grow in the lands up there.  So they can get pats on the back and told 'well done'  and 'that's the only reason why we acknowledge you as almighty God leader of NZ'.  Keep up the state of no work!</p>

                                    <p>Then the northern hemisphere will have a destination where to send the proceeds of crime investors to.  The leaders of gangs and the like.  THey can pay bribe bribe bribe money and maybe even supply 20 14 year old finance student virgins to NZ in exchange for.. . Doesn't matter what... I mean, you don't have to honor your contracts when you chose to do business only with degenerate criminals -- right?  When you break your promise.. What are they going to do? Bomb Christchurch?  You are welcome.  Bring it on...</p>

                                    <p>I mean, let's put it this way (to help people make informed investment decision)...  Has ANY STUDENT EVER paid the University of Waikato more money than I did?  For all the years the recorded me as being enrolled (for all the years they sent invoices to the NZ Government for keeping me enrolled).  I am wondering whether any University of NZ has ever in the entire history of the University got soooooooo much money from the NZ government for keeping a single studnet enrolled.  Ever?  Ever.  Has any University in NZ ever made so much money ever before as what the University of Waikato made off of me?</p>

                                    <p>What do we call this?  The money cow.  I do  believe.  I am quite the money cow.  Right?  And the only way I can repay my debt is my untimely slaughter.  Because I am money cow.  Right?</p>

                                    <p>Wah wah wah wah wah we have no medical doctors, no psychitrists.  Only 1 clincal psychologist to write 'reccomend: No treatment therefore pay me money'.  Quite the..  Brain drain..  Taster the brain...  Concentration camp extermination chamber to anyone with brain...  The nature of the brain drain.  All the brains go down the drains.  Look see at our native planation of the food-stuffs almighty god visitors from overseas.  Check-see the state of our governnce!!! must have!!!</p>

                                    <p>Oh, and then how many years of work?  How much money how much money how much money?  How many EFTS of money should go to the University for 1 EFTS of work?  For 3 EFTS of work for 4 EFTS of work?  How much money?  How much money?  How much money?  And how many years of labor was that?  How many weeks of labor?  How many weeks of labor?  HOw many weeks of labor?  Hey...  I know.. Only people proclalimed stupid and incopmetent imeciles psychopathic mad stupid f*cking retards poor weak incompetent imbecels wards of the state will be reenrolled and renrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled..  That is the fate of the entire population of NZ -- right?  But why stop there?  Rolli tout to Australasia -- right?  But why stop there/  Roll it out to Northern America -- right?  But why stop there?  Why stop>  Why Stop>  Why stop>  Just keep keeping slaves never pay tem take their work..  NEver stop praising the almighty god of ashley nobody else was eligible to apply nobodoy else applied noody else has a phd any teaching experience any research.  Only game in town.  Never stop never stop never stop paying the nz gvoernment from the proceeds of your crimes.  Never stop never stop never stop.. There's nothing here.  </p>

                                    <p>Private Psychiatry???  It doesn't many any sense.  Psychiatry.  'Psychiatry' is a means or mechanism for the Government to record you as mad, bad, degenerate, incapacitated, incompentent, not fit etc etc etc.  Nobody would voluntarily sign up for help or assistance.  Nobody would voluntarily sign their kids up for school or education or anything either, though, however.  For similar samey reasons.  There's nothing here...  It isnt' abuot public  / private.  theres imply nothin ghere, at all..</p>

                                    <p>Hmm... I can't decide.  Do I want a kid to be bullied to death by the likes of Pilcher, Ashby, Howe and company...  Or the likes of Uffindel.  What private school should I send my kid to, then, to be bullied to death?</p>

                                    <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/us-canada/300776843/new-york-state-approves-composting-of-human-bodies  Well, that's great.  Of course it isn't about the weathly people who get to choose that they want to be composted instead of having an entire mausoleum pyramid to the gods in tehir honor.. It's about the people in prisons or state care institutions and the aborted foetuses (who aren't to be used in cosmetics or similar) the ones that don't make their way into the food chain of the 'hospitals' or 'prisons' more overtly can be fed into the hospital or prison food chains a little more (but not much) roundaboutly.  The value of a life.  Right?  Apparenlty  if homo sapiens is not signed off as having been enculturated properly then it's just another animal.  Right?</p>

                                    <p>Whitcoulls?  What?  Eh?  I remember it.  It was a 'book shop'.  But there aren't any book shops anymore. No such thing.  </p>

                                    <p>(1)  suppose you send your kid to the 'private school rich list'.  What's the ideology, here?  That the most money the parents pay to the school pays for the kid to win the academic prizes?  Is that the idea? Most money buys most academic prizes?  No?  Something else..  Most money buys  best teachers.  Best teachers buys best grades?  Best teachers buys the answers to the questions in the exams?  Is that the idea? Suppose there are kids on scholarships.  Full fee ride.  What's their job, then, in the institution?  To be punching bags for the other kids?  Sexual outlets?  Moral support?  Future partners?  Party party party on the way to 'practice' so people can be more forceful with their future partners?  What's the f*cking plan?  It doesn't make any sense, at all...</p>

                                    <p>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/idaho-student-killings-murder-suspect-bryan-kohberger-was-a-creep-in-high-school-acquaintances-say/4YTTASF7LNGOXIISX3UPFQUTME/  Here we go.  Here's the face of...  Pediatrics?  Secondary Edcuation?  Primary, Kindegarten?  What Honors and Awards will the NZ governmetn give to him in exhange for his incapacitating adn disabling as many people born in NZ (thorough no fault of their own) as possible?  I don't konw..  How much money will they require him to pay into plastic surgery first?  Pay to falsify his dental records?  Pay to falsify his PhD Graduation?  Only graduate the pedophile moleserting sexual offenders..  Redeployed to NZ???  Is that the ideal here??

                                    <p>Oh me oh me oh me oh me oh my!  now is about the time when the Almighty Lord Ashley gets to hand pick chose on altogether personal grounds (photographs included) which of the 18 year old (or 14 year old super specials) will get to be enrolled in his qualifiation for all the qualities that it is that he values.  Don't worry -- if you are handpicked for all the personal qulities that he values you have no recourse whatsover to complain when he chnged his mind and doesn't value you anymore (surprise!! That's the day of your submission or yout graduation) who would have seen it coming!!!!!!!  Why he valued you..  ANd why  he chooses not to value you any longer.  That's a no brainer.  As they say in public or population health.  You need to have a stuplid brain.. Sorry you need to not have a brain to understand the special kind of brilliance tht values the..  Uh .  Invaluable.  Incomperable one and only Lord almighty saviour.  Ashley!!!!!  Nobody else need apply.  No applicatons.  INcomperable!!!  There was no alternative!!!</p>

                                    <p>How much money did the Ausralian Natioal University get for having me enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled?  More than any other studnet?  Was there a single studnet who the ANU proftiteered more off of than me?  I thikn I might be the contender... F or money cow of the forever...  Was I the best earner for the University?  Got the Australiain Governmetn hnding over for my detention?   Wells...  I se why teh ANU can only go up in the worlds estimation (guffaw).  yeah.  Right....</p>

                                    <p>Hey, I know..  She thinks she's so clever..  SO smart..  (She doesn't think that -- we do)  She needs to be taught a lesson (how to justify that)...  I know..  lEt her b e the shinigng guiding lgiht of an example, then.  If we can force her to do it we can force everybody to do it.  Treat her badly and then roll htat out to populations.  Hehehehehhehehehe it's fucking brilliant in stupid opsychopath land.</p>

                                    <p>Almighty God and Saviour Ashley didn't even take the time to APPLY to study in the PhD programme.  Never took the time to write a thesis.  Never took the time to APPLY for tenured positions.  Never did the work tutoring and grading and making up courses to teach...  Just gets f*cking handed millions of taxpayers dollars to do what, now?  To pull 3 facial expressions of the 'awwww' and 'feeel  better' and 'mmmmm' variety.  So that the Universtiy of Auckland can imprison international students on the grounds that they were raped by teh chosen few and need to be deported with no qualifications ASAP.  Right, Ashley?  Allllll the government research and teaching funding for you.  Almighty saviour.  You you you you you.  Nobddy else can do anyting in NZ.  Nobody else applied.  No people.  Nothing nothing nothing.  </p>

                                    <p>I mean seriously... When it's 'hand in my thesis' day and they are gunning from you from the sniper clocktowwer...  Do you want yourself an RPG walker or a mouse and kekyboard conrol devise?  Nuff said...</p>

                                    <p>Oh but don't worry.  Ashley's got it covered.  The only people on payroll to mismanage the situation.  Ensure that all and only those who document how they are the only people on payroll for doing nothing at all remain the only people on payroll...</p>

                                    <p>Of course the 'Universities' (yeah right) would be expected to have lists of what courses they offer and what people are on payroll to teach those courses.  So that prospective students can see who is employed to teach them and what courses they are employed to teach.  I am wondering how they are going to market Ashley.  Person without a PhD with no research outputs.  I am trying to invisage his CV.  Why people would voluntarily choose to enrol in his qualification.  Why would anybody think that students enrolled in it were voluntary?  Well, there is that...  Mostly the 'universities' are doing away with individual webpages for the academics they apparently or allegedly have on payroll.  You are just supposed to be enrolled at an institution that doesn't even have any academics on staff to teach you.  Apparently.  Institutions that don't have any research outputs, even.  Not even trying to be universities, hey.  What's the difference between a 'university' or a prison or detention camp.  A prison.  A quarantine facility?  You tell me Chris Hipkins?  The criminology pipeline that they taught you at Wellington Wellington Wellington Wells, now, was it?</p>

                                    <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/wellbeing/parenting/130896229/baby-whose-gender-reveal-went-viral-named-after-greatgrandma-who-popped-the-balloon  Hmm.. Why was it shared so many times? Well... See.  Bots share with bots share with bots share with bots.  Sometimes in finfinte loops that will melt your graphics card.  Sometims that's the way the world works.  That's why.  They wanted to see if sharing would melt peoples graphics cards.  </p>

                                    <p>I imagine the great de-population strategy is about to really get underway.  The thing about composting.  Right? How do dispose of the bodies.  I thought likely what they were doing, in Auckland, was hanging them underneath the harbor so the shellfish or whatever sealife could eat them.  I thought that was probably or likely a thing to do.  How far under Quay street can you go?  Under the water, there.  Do the quarantine facilities dump their raw untreated sewerage (of all varieties) directly into the harbor water?  I would expect or suppose that they do.  All the undocumented people.  The people the various governments have  been keeping with no birth certificates.  No passports.  No school qualifications.  All the people who were violently offended against by the only people the governmetn chooses to have on payroll etc etc.  A place to dump the human remains.  Right?  The proceeds of their crimes.  Any evidence against them.  Olivia and the like.  Right?  What did Mason Pendrous do?  I guess Justice Toogood would know.  Quite the name, that.  It's in the bag with Justice Toogood.  Clearly.  APpointed by proper process, and all.  Of course.  For sure.  Composting the bodies then.  Of course.  For sure.  All voluntary-like all thsoe who have been volunteered.</p>

                                    <p>Another election?  Why would we think we had a previous election?  What postal system or service?  The postal workers are paid to divert and dump bags of post or election mail.  Right?  So the papers can be taken and so that some people can submit multiple papers.  Right?  There was some wind or word of that last election.  Did people look into that?  The accusations that the election was fraud or phoney?  Did they look into accusations or claims that some people submitted multiple voting papers while other people never received them?  That's the aim or the goal or the purpose or the point of this nasty degenerate social engineering experimetn land.  Right?  To have nobody vote.  So they realise that voting makes absolutely no difference to the outcome of th election because there is no alternative.  It makes no difference.  None of the votes and all of the power.  Maybe just give Lord God Ashley the role of Prime Minister next?  Also Judge.  Jury.  Executioner?  People will take their shots one way or another.  One shot or another.  On schedule or demand.  So that the public planning people know how many institutions of torture abuse and execution they need to set up across the land.  Right? All the institutions of state care.  Institutions to house children and teenagers.  Institutions to house adults in the name of quarantine, hospitals.  Even 'apartment complexes' and the like.  No lack of government interference into the lives of the people.  Deciding how badly to keep them in conditions of abuse torture and deprivation.</p>

                                    <p>They say NZ has a very compliant population.  People say 'yes sir yes sir' and then simply do the opposite.  That's the nature of the compliance.  Then pretend to be too f*ckign stupid to understand or to have understood.  People will comply in saying they gave peple their shots (even if they pour the shots down the drain).  You really can't listen to anything anybody says.  No speak English.  Not trying to speak literl truth.  What are they doing?  Keep your head down, apparently.  So happy.  So happy.  Be signed up be signed up for the Ashley Bloomfield Degree in it's entirely personal if he picks you for hte next extermination camp.  Look at how busy busy busy they are undermining public confidence.  THey are undermining public confidence in choosing to do the f*ckign things they choose to do.</p>

                                    <p>Indoctonation detention camps for the gamma meat animals.  THeir decisions to mis-manage things in that way is what results in undermining public confidence.  Something would be very very very very very very wrong if the public had any confidence in their so obviously corrupt and stupid mis-management.  Ffs.  Just how stupid do they think people actually are?  Do they actually take them to be?  They actually think it doesn't matter at all because they can't or won't do anything about it.  There's nothign here.  What health system? W hat education system? W hat social services?  There's nothing here.</p>

                                    <p>Don't worry everybody.  Keep Calm!  Dawn Freshwater is obviously the antedote to stagnant swamp syndrome that they have in NZ.  Ashley Bloomfield can get the poppies growing again. Opiates for the people!  Restore confidence!  Who isn't confident that Lord Savior God Ashley wil save the University now that he's been appointed God and Savior of it all.  He never even needed to have applied!  THey just followed the twits, I mean the tweets.  The twitterbots.  Let the Twitter bots tell the twits what the twits believe in.  How many like share and subscribes.  The army of twitter bots can train the leaders of NZ to the public confidence they have by murdering off anybody who doesn't feed into their stupid f*cking social engineering experiement trying ot bring harry harlow's brand of love to the world by turnign teh world into a primate research facility.  In how homo sapiens aren't really persons if they ar eprevented and prohibited from aspects of behavioral modernity.  THey aren't people.  So then no harm exterminating them.  Just round them up for the slaughter when you are done collecting up the fruits of their labors for yourselves.  F*ckign psychopaths.  No even a hint of try.  Nobody need apply.  Just re-deploying psychopaths into different positions. Moving the sh*t around.</p>

                                    <p>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/the-front-page-revisited-how-new-zealands-low-literacy-rate-impacts-the-economy/VS5YSAVS2VAZXPRYK3X3P3GDLU/  Illiteracy...  Right.  Well, what do you call it when the people say 'hey, it's written into the education and training act that domestic adults are eligible for the programme they apply to but the universities are refusing to enrol them on grounds that they failed the literacy assessment'?  I mean to say...  I don't think they have properly considered the 'economic benefits' of keeping everybody in NZ in a prison slave or detention camp.  Paying them less than minimum wage on grounds that they are deemed 'illiterate'.  Not processing their applications on grounds that they are 'illiterate'.  'Illiterate' means what?  It means that they don't process their complaints.  The United Nations can't hear complaintsn from illiterates.  Right?  They can't submit their complaint.  Won't  get past the bot test.  Think of the economic gains to be had by the f*cking psychopaths in saying that everyone (except for Chris Hipkins who gets alllll the portfolios and Ashley who gets allllllll the 'doctor' jobs for his having an undergraduate level MBChB so he's one of teh very very very very few people acknowledged as qualified to work with pateints (except they wno't register him -- right)?  Think of the economic benefit to recording reenrolment and reenrolment nd reenrollment and reenrolment so that people can spend decades being enrolled in 1 year training programmes so that the government can record more and more and more debt against their name.  That's what it meeeeeeans to  not be able to do math.  Right?  To not have the basic conception of how they pay you for the work that you do.  You don't pay them for the work that you do.  They give you qualifiations for when you have met the requirements of them.  There's nothing here.  No people.  Do you see any signs of behaviorl modernity?  Do you Sterelny?  There aren't any people here.  Didn't you know?</p>

                                    <p>It isn't that society is unravelling now.  It unravelled many many years ago.  When has there ever been a proper election in NZ?  Has there ever been one?  Would any of the elected officials have been elected (announced as having been elected) if they hadn't have cheated on their campaign donations and so on and so forth?  So then they weren't fairly elected.  So then, what democracy?  What do the politicians and parliament people actually do, anyway?  Apparently they pass laws.  That's what they do.  But it doesn't matter what the laws are, in NZ because the judiciary refuses to uphold the laws.  You can read the clearest clearest laws that there are...  The clearest statement of the clearest laws.  Aspects of statute.  Statutory law.  Written in plain f*cking english to be understandable and understood by normal f*cking people.  Not by lawyers.  Not laws for lawyers.  Laws for regular people..  And you can see how the government employees (employees of the public universities and the like) simply refuse to comply with the laws.  Won't do it.  They can't even accept the education and training act that prescribes to the public universities which students are eligible for enrolment.  THey refuse to accept that.  They throw applications away so as to expedicate the selection of teenagers.  So they can quickly quickly quickly try and find the next lot of psychopaths to comit atrocities against the NZ people.  look at the only sorts or kinds of research projects that get funding.  Look at all the observational studies in our recording how sick and deprived and poorly people are being kept in NZ intentioanlly  by design because we aren't sure if any different is appropriate for our unique sociocultural environment.  But again it doesn't matter what any of thelaws are because the judicairy refuses to uphold the laws.  It's in the f*cking Australiain constituion that NZ is a f*cking state of Australia.  And they just go 'nonononononono australia doesn't have to honor it's constitution, even.  We can do anything anything we like.  We can declare NZ to be the new manus island and send all the shit there'.  Only they don't seem to know what sh*t is.  When you look at the only research tey will fund.  Psychopathy.  Psychopathy.  Lets see the world be taken over by overtaken by psychopaths.  QUicklky quicly quicly bomb them!!!  THe vermin are breeding!  THey are spreading their idology about the lands!!!  Lord God Ashley is capturing the hearts and minds of the behaviorally not-modern meat-animals!  Bred specifically to withstand nuclear strike.  There's nothing here.  </p>

                                    <p>Fruit flies breed a lot.  A rather large thing for how quickly it breeds.  That's why they like them for genes research.  They breed more quickly than pea plants.  Right?  Then you can nuke them.  Microwave them.  Irradiate them.  Subject them to nuclear srike of varying intensities and see what happens to the offspring.  Discover the single-gene mutation or knock-out (the real knock-out babies)in this manner or way.  You could do that for people too.  Of course.  Subject them to levels amounts or degrees of radiation in order to see what single gene mutations you can breed.  You can get some cells producing cancers within the lifetime of the individuall.  It might be possible to spead the cancer around...  If you get cancerious cells in the blood (the cancerous cells actually travel around the body, right, to seed in different plces).  Not sure if you can take cancer from one person and seed it into another in that manner mode or way.  You know that there will be people on government payroll doing tehir very very very very very very best to bring it to be, though, of course.  Those are the only kinds or sorts of projects that are the 'must have' for all of the government funding.  Right?  Im not sure the direction of flow... If people pay the government in exhange for the Government turning a blind eye to the atrocieties.  Maybe more than that.  Maybe they pay the government in exhange for titles and honors.  Being entitled 'sir' or 'professor' or 'lord and savior'.  Being appointed as the VC.  I don't know if the psychopaths pay the government in exhange for bogus honors and titles..  Or if the government really does pay Chris Whelan quarter of a million dollars per year to go visit vietnam and brazil and so on and so forth trying to blackbird for 20 14 year old virgins or whatever he is looking for to be enrolled in the Ashley Bloomfield (almighty god) PhD programme in health con-munications for population herd management.  Or whatever it is.  Whatever it is that we are supposed to believe.</p>

                                    <p>If they don't want to undermine public confidence then they need to start (honestly and truly) telling the people what they are doing in fact to try and make things, this sort or kind of a situation. ..  Better.  Instead they just seem to be working only to compound and compound nd compound the injustice.  The ministry for the prevention and prohibition of social development. T he ministry of injustice.  The ministry of sickness and ill helath and disease.  The 'univesity'?  What the hell are we to make of that?  What academics?  What research outputs?  They can't do the most basic f*ckign thing of examining studnets work on it's actual academic merits.  They won't allow the studnets to engage in academic research.  There aren't any journals.  COn-munication propaganda is not academia.  They have professors publishing in a glossy print 'nz medical students journal' ffs.  THey won't even let teh studnets publish in the students journall. The professors don't have professional journls to opublish in.  SOuxie is honest to say that she needs to hand over $20,000 to have anything from her lab considered for internatinonal journal pubklication.  I imagine that's the cost of them needing to check up on her work.  Did he fiddle the stats?  Just say what the government wanted her to say?  Did she even do what she said was done in her lab?  Did they make up teh data?  Garbage garbage garbage output.  Where is her research output?  Media con-munications.  Con.  The great con.  What students does she have?  For how many years have they been enrolled in what qualification? When does their reserch output go out for external examination?  Where are the external examiners reports for the Auckland theses?  What theses?  What research outputs? W hat academics on staff?  What university?  What medical school?  What hospital?  Grafton hospital campus.  When was the last time the international inspectors went through adn wrote up how many crimes against humnity.  How much conditions of torture nd uncessary cruelty and deprivation.  Inhumane.  Will not have things any other way.  Won't process applications to enroll.  Won't process studnets through training.  Won't sign off on completion.  Won't publically advertise jobs.  Won't hire the most academically qualified.  Won't do it.  There's nothing there.  Nobody home.  NOthing to see.  What developed world?  GO aroundt eh hospital and ask people who is being involutnariliy detatined aginst their will.  The problem is that those people are deemed 'not literate'.  The only literacy there is is 'whatever almighty god ashley has told me to believe'.  No peple.  NOthing here.  </p>

                                    <p>What we are left with is prison cells in the detention camps.  The 'University' of Auckland decided to invest their money in building large tower blocks of individual room cells.  One toilet and shower block for I don't know how many people.  People to be kept 1 or 2 to a cell.  The proliferation of buildings such as these.  Battery cell cages for the meat-animals.  And they were supposed to do what?  Sit in their rooms and use their computers to type-ity type-ity type.  That's that, Sterelny?  If a million monkeys type or a million years one of them will eventually output the entire works of Shakespeare.  Well, then, if all we need is for them to output the next con-mnication for Ashley then I guess maybe Ashley can be attributed as having outputted one..  Or maybe two...  Per year?  Is that the idea/l, here?  How... *meaningful*.  How..  Aspirational.  How..  Motivational.  Who wants to have levesl of debt recorded against their name so the Univesrity can collect up more and more and more nd more money to build another high rise and another and another and another and another.  Build a hospital?  That's an idea/l.  You ccould ship them from the university to the prison to thehospital to the prison to the university to hte hospital to the prison to the university.  To the quarantine facility.  Start with them in their incubator and then ship them to the boarding school.  Then the unviersity.  The prison the hospital the quarantine facility.  To the aged care facility.  They can live in their little cells like that.  Battery-people.  The problem is that we don't have enough people.  The problem ist hat there are too many people it's soooo competitive.  The problem is that our nation is soooo small.  It's too tiny.  That's how come only one person ever gets picked out to do everything or all the things.  Only one biologist.  Only one philosopher.  Only one physicist (epidemeology apparently).  Not big enough to do nuclear physics.  We'll just get the Americans to have a satellite campus from America filled with people from America to point things they want to lalunch wherever they want to launch them.  Nobody from NZ has the capacity to get out of their battery cage.  What people?</p>

                                    <p>Garbage garbage garbage.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                    <p>Good morning good morning the generalist said as we met him last week on his way to the OR.  Now the patients he greeted are most of them dead and they're cursing his 'staff' (they don't pay them they don't pay them they don't pay them they don't pay them) for incompetent swine.</p>

                                    <p>I talk about personal things here not because I am fishing for empathy or pity or anything like that.  I say these things because I used to feel embarrassed or ashamed about them.  I used to think that it was my fault.  Something must have been wrong with me.  I now realise that it is actually more likely that others had a similar time of things.  That they also were also encouraged to believe that the problem was with them.  It wasn't anything that is a problem more widely.  It's all very very particular and personal against them as a person.  Waikato's treatment of me was very very particular vendetta against me.  It isn't that they are treating other students similarly.  But Chris Whelan said that they did not treat me any differently from how they treat other studnets.  That Waikato treated me comparably to how the other NZ Universities treat all their other graduate studnets.  Indeed...  I know of many other graduate research studnets who were bullied into not submitting their work in anything like a timely fashion.  How they were repeatedly told they weren't good enough and their work was garbage and they needed to do anything anything anything their supervisors and the administration said for many many  years in excess of the requirements for the qualification else they were required to walk away from the whole thing.  They were required to hand over payments of extra fees in order to be allowed to submit their thesis at all.  </p>

                                    <p>I mean to say that a 'me too' kind of public awareness is the thing.  That's why I post about my experience.  Because I suppose I think that other people out there might go...  Oh...  So maybe I am not garbage useless when the Univesrity tells me that I am.  Maybe my work isn't garbage useless crap when the University tells me that it is.  Maybe the problem lies with the corruption within the NZ Universities and not with my being a stupid idiot incompetent.  So f*cking useless that I can't output 40,000 words in 1 year or 100,000 words in 2 years (to allow up to one year of external examination).  The reason why they won't get the work to the externals is not because they believe the externals will say it isn't good enough and fail the studnet.  We know this because the Universities themselves are saying the work isn't good enough and are failing the students.  The externals aren't  being given the work because the Univesrity knows full well the external examiners will sign the student off.  The Univesrity wanted to send my work out with a 'statement of reservations'.  That is or means to say they wanted to send my work out to externls with a f*cking notes to tell the externals that the University wanted to see me failed.  With friends like these who needs enemies.  Right?  What possible skin off their nose is it to see me credited with a 1 year masters for 1 year of work ffs?  I mean seriously...  Because Justine Kingsbury isn't (allowed?) to output more than about 5,000 words of new research every...  Oh...  5 years is it?  </p>

                                    <p>It isn't about freedom of speech.  I mean to say that is not the problem.  I mean to say that when they say the problem is that they don't like what I have to say therefore they feel obliged or compelled to shoot the messanger -- that is not the problem, here.  The thesis I wrote for the ANU was not overtly political.  There was also plenty of opportunity for supervisors to steer it in non-political directions and / or to warn me that there was no freedom of speech if there was in fact no freedom of speech at the University.  Other people I know were bullied and forced to labor for many years in excess of requiremetns while supervisors didn't supervise else while supervisors were moved around so they could say they were required to start over on a different project or re-write their project into a different project over and over nd over so the university oculd get more nd more nd more and more money for more and more enrolments of their studnet slaves.  None of the other studnets I knew in this positoin were working on anything political.  So that wasn't the thing at all.  It isn't about freedom of speech or bout people not having the freedom to speak freely.  The problem is the actual practice of keeping slaves.  Forcing people to pay considerable excess of time and money.  I think simply because..  THey are getting away with it.  I think that is the only reason why.  Because they are doing it.  So the people who were signed off in something approximating a timely fashion...  THey would have walked.  And told everyone they knew that the Univesrity had screwed them.  Posted it on Farcebook and Twitter.  Got hundreds of like share and subscribes for how the University was refusing to get their work to externals, refusing to give them the examiners reports.  Refusing ot get their updated work back to externals.  Refusing ot graduate all and only the studnets who had been signed off as having produced work of the requisite quality by exteransl.</p>

                                    <p>It isn't about freedom of speech or otherwise.  It has absolutely nothing to do with the content of the thesis.  With what is said in it.  It has absolutely nothing to do with that. It has everything to do with the corrupt practices and processes.  I mean to say, they think they have intentionlly designed the qualification to be an impossible triangle such that it is structurally imppossible by design for anybody to ever meet the requirements of it.  For example:  120 points or 1 EFT is an enrolment time of at least 34 weeks (the minimum set by the Tertiry Education Commmission) and a maximum of 12 calendar months.  What happens if your enrolment exceeds 12 calendar months?  That means that either the 120 point qualification you were enrolled in has become excess of 120 points therefore more fees are owing else you are forced to accept less than full time status over the year of work you already did in order for their to be any remaining enrolment points left to be distributed towards more enrolment time.  Understand?</p>

                                    <p>The TEC says the enrolmelment time includes the examination period.  It includes studying for exams, sitting exams, waiting for the outcome of exams (grades) to occur.  This is supported by the University requirement that you are required to be enrolled the day you submit you rthesis in fulfilment of requirements for the qualification.  That means to say, if the examiners take 3 months to examine it, they recommend up to 10 weeks of changes (fix up a few typos, alter a few sentence constructions, add a reference or two) then you are required to be enrolled at the end of the examination process at the end of the changes process.  You are required to be enrolled the day you hnd the final thing in to the University.</p>

                                    <p>The University says that it is normal typical or standard for the external examination process to take 3 months.  That is or means to say that it is sensible to time budget for 3 months of externl examination so that you aren't stuck having to pay 3 months extra fees at the end of your qualification.  If you are required to work for 12 calendar months on a 120 point qualification to be followed by 3 months of external examination then the University has made it impossible by design to complete the qualification in less than 15 months.  You will need to pay 3 months extra fees to have your thesis accepted by the Univesrity no matter what the external examiners say in their reports.  They make it impossible by design.</p>

                                    <p>The University says that the outcome of what they like to call 'first examination' is always that the studnet is required to re-enrol for at least 6 months before re-submitting for another round of external examination.  In other words, they say (word of mouth) that after laboring for 12 months on a 120 point MPhil there will be 3 months of externl examination.  The examiners always will find at least 1 typographical error.  The University says that that is enough for the Univesrity to say the studnet needs to pay 6 months more fees for 6 months more full time enrolment.  Then they need to pay for 3 motnhs more fees for 3 months external examination.  If you complain about any of this then they won't give you the qualification at ll.  Limp away.  Not a Univesrity.  Do you see?  The impossible qualification.  The 120 point MPhil qualification listed in the Univesrity of Waikato Calendar.  Approved (the points value of 120 points MPhil) by the Tertiary Education Commission.  Universities New Zealadn accepted that 120 points of credit was appropriately associated with the MPHil from the University of Waikato.  It was listed in teh Calendar.  </p>

                                    <p>They say that graduate research doesn't have a points value associated with it.  They say that they can keep people slaving for decades for no credit and no pay.  Demanding more and more and more money indefinately from the Government and the studnet for keeping the studnet slave.  Else they say that there is a 7 year lifetime entitlement and since they did not give the studnet the equalaification in 7 years they never will.  So then lets' see what they did with my work the first 7 years i was at Univesrity.  The 2 years of Masteres work that they never told me needed to go out for PhD examination else I would never be allowed to complete the PhD.  The bogus shitty garbage garbage garbage garbage garbage.  What Univesrity?  How many research words did you write this year Justine?  All your f*cking studnets millions of monkeys typing millions of words for you over how many years and you can't even copy paste your first year studnets work into something original for yourself.  Mismanaging everyting mewards.  F*cking garbage.  Garbage.  Garbage for sure.</p>

                                    <p>How hard could it possibly be to say 'here is a f*cking topic.  We want people to study some aspect of it or whatever over 1 year' and pay how many people to write, effectively, a 5,000 or 6,000 word piece for a special edition or a journal or a book or something.  Better yet, the deadline due date is with enough time for you to get people to swap their work with another so they can write some 2,500 word critique of it, to then  be followed by a 2,500 word response.  What's that?  A range of people expressing a range of views, in print?  Maybe the topic catches on in that way.  Differences start to be articulated.  People are genuinely interested in hearing more because they are in the process of making up their own minds what they think about the issue.  What's that?  Academic dialogue and debate.  Difference.  Disagreement.  Controversy.  It's interesting.  Intellectually stimulating.  Entertaining.</p>

                                    <p>Yes sir yes sir three bags full sir.  We took out everything and anything that could be the slightest bit controversial because otherwise it won't be 'accepted'.  In order to have your work 'accepted' it means that you can only say p=p.   You can never say anything new or controversial.  To have what you say accepted means you can only spout what has already been accepted.  The element of progress is apparently that they are teachign you something new.  So your process of writing a thesis goes 'first I believed sometihng and it was stupid and wrong and then my supervisors and the entire community told me where and when and why I was wrong and I kludged together everythign tehy wrote for me in response to the rioeythurjghfj I got from the post-modernist essay generator as my initial views or thoughts on the topic and they wrote the thesis for me'.  Otherwise they never would lhave accepted it.  Right?</p>

                                    <p>Duuuuuuh.  Welcome to stupid academics-land where there aren't any academics.  What Univesrsity?  What intellectually stimulating environmetn?  F*cking psychopaths so far as the eye can see...</p>

                                    <p>Silly girl.  People don't want to go to University so they can be exposed to a stimulating academic environment.  They want to go to Univesrity so they can suck Ashley Bloomfields dick all day under the faint promise that if they suck his dick all day for the next decade or two or three then maybe he will give them some kind of harem of their own.  Or a high paying job, at least, so they can be slum lord of however many virgins of their own.  Pimp them out for profits or whatever.  That's the aim the goal the purpose or the point.  Right?  After a few others have been marched off to the death camps.  Quite a lot of collateral damage on the several decades long programme of sucking Ashley's dick all day, I would imagine or suppose.  Don't worry little teenagers.  Iti's all entirely personal.  It isin't systemic or systematic at all.  It's all entirely personal because of something being intrinsically off or wrong about you.  That you don't take your Professosr Glue's horse tranquiliers or whatever it is and put on your happy face.  Mmmm Ashley.  I see why they hired you.  All your accademic outputs!  Crowning glory of the University!  All Heil!!</p>

                                    <p>Of course this kind or sort of research output (a journal or edited book collection) could never happen in New Zealand because the person in charge of the project wouldn't accept other people's submissions so there wouldn't be anything to publish.  They wouldn't accept any of the articles that had been submitted.  Or maybe the only people who they would accept submissions  by or from would be people who weren't capable of outputting more than about 5,000 words every decade.  So the books publication or the journal's publication couldn't be for at least a decade!  Because only people who aren't willing and or able to output 5,000 in a timely fashion are acknowledged as being academics.  How long does it take for an undergraduate studnet to output 5,000 word essay on the topic of their teacher or supervisors (editors, governments) choosing?  How long?  Do they write..  Maybe...  5,000 words in one semester for one course wehre the full time workload is 4 courses?  Is that what the third year studnets are doing these days?  How about the honors year studnets?  Could you get one of them to do it?  WRite 5,000 words on the topic of the governments or the journal or book editors choosing?  THey could even supply a list of starting references if they expected to see you build your work upon a certain body of literature that they had already funded or whatever.  The state of the current debate.</p>

                                    <p>But no nononononono.  It's all garbage.  Right?  It's all garbage.  The problem is that all the undergraduate work is garbage.  All the first in classes and the A grardes that they give they only give those grades to the garbage.  To the garbage to the garbage.  That's how come the graduate studnets with the very very best undregraduate grades are never allowed to write so much as 5,000 words for a f*cking journal or book or whatever.  Garbage garbage garbage.  There isnt' anything in NZ.  It's all garbage.  No reseaerch outputs.   Nobody is allowed to speak or say anything.  It isn't because of lack of free speech.  It is because you have 1 person in charge of the whole thing...  And, effectively, they won't allow anybody else to do anything.  Teh 1 editor or boss wnts to rewrite ALL the articles.  So the 1 editor or boss won't allow any of the people to work to the f*cking deadline.  There's nothing here.  Quite by design.  They aren't even trying to produce any kind of research output at all.</p>

                                    <p>I am not really sure what the deal is.  Why NZ is such a f*cking tower of Babel.  Nobody speak the English.  No reseaerch outputs.  Nobody on payroll.  Nobody who is wilin gand or able to do any f*cking work.  That's for f*cking sure.</p>

                                    <p>D D D D D D Don't worry.  D D D D David Lumsden finally go around to submitting or having accepted a 7,500 word article (was it?) in honor of all the work that I did (me and another graduate student, apparently) on personal identity.  A topic that he wasn't interested in, at all, until we worked on it for hoever many f*cking years.  Under him.  While he refuses to get it to journals etc etc etc.  D D D D D D Don't worry.  At least NZ got something for me and the other student.  Whoever they are.  Whatever they are doing now.  Psych institution for them maybe?  Prison?  Still at University, perhaps?  Living in his basement or something since they can't afford to pay rent anywhere...  D D D D Don't worry.  I see why they had to pay D D D D David Lumsden.  Born in England.  Educated at Princeton.  To not realy do any research.  To not hav ehis studnets signed off in a timely fashion. D D D D Don't worry everybody.  W W W W Who wants to d d d d do (don't) do graduate student research with Universities of NZ.  D D D D D D  D .  How many j  j j j journals was there?  H h h how many conferences?  Workshops?  L ll l l l lively debate w w was there?  D D D Don't worry everybody.  Jus tbe signed up for the s s s s s sucking Ashley's d d d d dick d d d d degree.  W W W W Whether you w w w want to or not.  Am I being rude?  I think what's rude is the people who thought that it would be a good hire for teh Univesrity.  Second tier university tht it was to ensure that anybody they recorded has having been enrolled there were never credited with research at all.  Right?  Or, if htey were..  What was that?  SO you can work in a video store.  For minimum wage.  Maybe go work in a fish shop.  People thought that was funny.  Telling me that that would be a good job for me on graduateion.  Working in a fish shop.</p>

                                    <p>F F F F F F F*cking psychopaths.  There' snothing there.</p>

                                    <p>I suppose the situation likely was that David Lumsden's PhD was given to him by his supervisor (David Lewis of Princeton).  Where did David Lewis get the thesis from?  He was visiting Australia, regularly.  SO,maybe, it would be a sweet and fitting thing for David Lumsden's PhD thesis to have been aquisitiioned from or reappropriated from some studnet..  Maybe even from the University of Waikato.  Maybe that, then, meant that the University of Waikato studnet is required to be forgotten into obscurity.   Nobody has ever heard of them or any of their outputs.  They were told they were garbage garbage garbage garbage.  Teh University gave the work to Princeton and David Lewis kept things for himself..  Else passed things on to his s s s s s s s students.  L ll l l l like D d d d d David Lumsden.  I'm not sure how else he managed to output 100,000 words of PhD thesis since it took  him sooooooo f*cking loooooong to dooooooo anyyyyyythingggg eeeeelse.  ffs.  So, you know how it is.  There will be a job for me over their dead bodies.  Waiting for them to die.  Are they dead yet?  Are they dead yet?  How about now?  Today?  Are they dead yet?  How about now?  How f*cking tiresome or tedious.  What if I promise to retrin in something else..  Oh..  Nononononono no no there will neeeeever be a job for me.  All the f*cking inbred imbicels..  Nobody can work any faster than them!!!!! slooooooow dooooooown Kelly.  Sloooooooooooow dooooooooown.</p>

                                    <p>The Australasian Journal of Philosophy was reatrributing the research outputs of Australasia (the work sent by early career researchers) to Professors etc in the Northern Hemisphere.  The Philsophy and Biology journal that Sterelny was former editor of when he was working out of Wellington Wellington Wellington WElls Victoria University of Wellington Wellington Wellington Wells (not to be confused with Victoria Melbourne a real destination for the 'cool factor')...  That was reattributing work done again to Professors etc overseas.  But also giving some publications to Sterelny and even his chosen children, I suppose.  The ones trained in his how to mis-manage the research  outputs mewards.  I suppose.  You need to carefully handpick them for not having any thing original or whatever to say...  You see...  So they can buy into the whole thing of needing to reappropraite others work and of course eliminate and exterminate anybody who actually produces from the Univesrity.  Take their stuff and replace them.  Don't worry nobodyis ireeplcablel.  A million monkeys typing for a million yeas will come out with the entire corpus of shakespeare eventaully.  What's that?  Better slow down for Sterelny.  He's not that quick in real-time conversation.  Perhaps then you won't meet with him very much...  I would imagine that would be right.  Hey, lets' all have a drink or two or three before we start conversing about things academic or intellectual.  Level the playing field or something.  He isn't that bright.  But he's good at telling peopel they f*cked the dog f*cking cunts.  Right?  If we can display that we have eliminated anything of any value from the University then the producers will run run run away.  Right when it is about time for them to be paid.  Great.  Then we can give their work to someone else.</p>

                                    <p>Take my work on Delusions Fiona MacPhearson.  Just take it.  The handout that I gave you and so on for the talk and the seminar prsentation that you went to.  Heard me do.  Saw my write up.  Just take it for yourself.  Paste my work onto your work on Synasthesia so you have half of my work so you can get the word count and have a new work that is partly mine.  Take all the credit for my work for yourself.  Well then I guess my work on delusions can never be credited or acknoweldged as attribute dto me now that you stole it for yourself.  Right?  Are you working on Funtions now John Matthewson?  After all the work I did on functions.  You thought you would take my work on funftions for yourself?  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                                    <p>There shouldn't have needed to be an oral defence of a 120 point 1  year masters for the simple reason that:  It's not supposed to be that f*cking hard.  Students aren't supposed to go 'oooooh I'm terrified of whether I will pass my Honors year I'm sooo scared that they might decide to withhold the Honors Qualification from me.  I did all the readings, attended all the scheduled activities and events, and really applied myself to my work.  I didn't do part time work, even, so I could really devote myself t my studies to get high grades..  Ooooh I'm soooo terrified that they will simply choose to fail me.  Trembling.  Trembling.' It's not supposed to be that f*cking hard.  Completing a 120 point Masters Research in 1 year should not be that f*cking hard for someone who applies themselves after having successfully completed an Honors Year (with a comparable word cout output completed in 9 months grades locked in) ffs.</p>

                                    <p>I think that the problem with me, really and truly is that others have in fact passed my work off as their own.  So now they need for me to die now.  Because it makes Fiona MacPhearson and the Univesrity she is employed at look bad that she outright stole a portion of my work on delusions.  And I'm sure the f*cking vultures have stolen most of everything else, too.  Right John Matthewson?  It doesn't matter who does the work, it matters who is credited as having done the work.  I find it pretty hard to beleive that the article that you supposedly wrote with Brett was an output of the both of you.  But, hey, what would I know.  I guess that was why it was so..  Uh...  Enlightening...  Uh..  Chatting with you about philosophy.  Yeah, right.  </p>

                                    <p>So of course they firstly wouldn't get my revised work back to the examiner.  Which would have been puzzling to the external examiner from Canada.  Why the student didn't get revised work to them within 10 weeks so they could sign off.  Why wouldnt' the student have done that?  And then, 6 months later, a thesis changed so much (in ways they never asked for) turns up and it's still only 50,000 words.  Why did the student, effectively, repeat the whole f*cking year?  What the hell?  So he asks for an oral defense.  So the Univesity says it is unanimous that I failed.  Because in f*cking retard psyschopath land 'oral defense' means 'failed'.  Riiiiight.  SO, uh Justice Toogood..  Uh.. . How many judgements do you write, then?  Every year that you are paid as judge for the high court?  I am asking your work output.  The writing of judgements. What's your expected word count per year?  Do you write that yourself?  Does your clerk write it for you?  How many co-authors do you get for a High Court Judgement output? Who edits it?  I would imagine or suppose that there is at least one independent pair of eyes to find and sort typographical errors and so on.  What is your work output allowed to be or credited as being?</p>

                                    <p>You did a 2 year Masters at Yale, right?  That was probably 1 year of course work and then a 1 year thesis, was it?  So, the equivalent of an Honnors year and a 1 year masters.  A 2 year programme of study with 1 year of coursework (like Honors) and 1 year of research.  How long was your research thesis?  What supervisory input did you get?  Did anybody help you fix your typos?  Did you get to graduate with your cohort?  Or did they gun tehm to death so that there was you and only you?  WEre you the only game in town?  The only applicant?  The only studnet enrolled in that programme?  Did they take your rsearch output and give it to someoen else?  Or did they give you the work output of someone else?  do they write the judgements for you, too?  Or is it you that denies the evidnece and so on and so forth.  LIke you've had your eyes f*cking poked out.  Yeees.  The problem is that I'm blind that you cannot see.</p>

                                    <p>I know it's not personal and particular against me (that's just their divide and conquer strategy).  There are definite patterns.  It seems that the people from Princeton are given credit for publishing the work of others.  Particularly.  I'm not entirely sure of the role of Rutgers as the Public University of the State of New Jersey.  They seem to take quite a few New Zealanders and Australians..  Have done over the years.  I know of quite a few who have gone there, I mean to say.  And  been shipped back afterwards.  To the colonies.  To help the work flow in the direcftion where the people from Princeton get all the credit for having done the best of the work and the people from the colonies are unproductive wastrels?  That's the idea/l, or something?  I suppose I am thinking of Carl Brusse...  Who was working on a PhD with someone at the ANU who left for Princeton.  So Carl was expected to start over (if he wanted to complete at all).  So he's kept on PhD wages for how many decades?  While his work is not credited for or under his name.  What happened to the work that he was forced to abandon before he was required to start over on a different topic entirely in order to be allowed to get a phD at all?  Someoen or other from Princeton kept it for themselves, did they?  Or did they hand it over to somewhere more obscure?  To help disguise the fact of the actual wastrels on payroll who aren't willing or able to supervise or even produce any research at all, really.</p>

                                    <p>So, the Australian National University got how much money for keeping Carl Brusse enrolled in a PhD over how many years?  While Sterelny tells him that his work is garbage garbage garbage the topic is garbage garbage worthless.  While everybody hears how Carl isn't productive and doesn't meet deadlines.  And so on and so forth.  But none of that is true.  Right?  It's just that Kim Sterelny and company are f*cking psychopathic bullies.  Right?  F*cking bullies.  And his early work would have been given to others so that others could receive credit for having written it but more in particular others could be expediated into payroll positions where (once they had attained their payroll positions) they would never have to ouput anything ever again.  Like Lumsden.  Right?  David Lumsden.  Who, because of the invesetment his parents made in paying Princeton?  Did they?  Did he get a scholarship to do a PhD there or did he pay private school fees so they could g g g g g g give him his p p p p p p phd.  And have him shipped off to the colonies and highly desirable p p p p p p p priceton graduate. To ensure the fate of his studnets as wastrels only.  To get their work back to p p p p priceton so they can h h h h hand it to s s s someone else without the w w w w willingness and or ability to do any actual f*cking research.</p>

                                    <p>I suppose that's the value in a p p p p p priceton education.  And so that's kind of a p p p p problem.  W w w w why anybody w w w w w w would want to go to the u u u u univeristy and s s s s suck the dicks of the likes of Ashley all day.  When he hasn't actually done any research...  That wasn't the hiring priority.</p>

                                    <p>They wouldn't graduate Paul Flood.  He is bullied into abandoning his PhD.  Forced abandonment.  I don't know how much his wife paid to immigrate to NZ and take a paid position.  If they waited a year or two Paul could have taken that paid position.  As a local.  But it is more fun to keep the domestic or local as a slave.  They wouldn't employ Brett Calcott.  But his wife works on similar things on paper.  I don't know how much she pays to come here and keep him as slave?  Maybe.  I don't know if Brett is on another payroll.  Kim seems to want to see him credited with him in the role of summarising or editorialising other peoples work.  I suppose that's a more honest way of going about things.  Rather than changing the names on teh authors of the work.  I suppose they aren't mutually exclusive things to do...  </p>

                                    <p>It is all (and only) about the money because there isn't anything of any value left.</p>

                                    <p>But why stop there?  Now, however many people will think that they can hand over a cheque to Princeton and be handed a trophy PhD to claim for themselves so they can take their Princeton PhD qualification and be deemed 'most qualified' for any academic position, particularly any one in the heathen borderlands.  Why wouldn't the university simply take the money from the student and...  NEver give them the qualification . When it is time to pay them, well, I guess they likely need volunteers for the teaching hospital and the like.  They could keep them as inpatients and make however much on medical billings now.  Why wouldn't they do that?  Why not?  Let's see..  How else could the psychopaths go about making money...  See, it's really not that hard to be a psychopath.  To think like one.  You just ignore the stuff that (some peopel have going on) to do with moral conscience and the like.  Just disregard moral concern or moral considerations.  That's why people think that psychopathy is a deficit kind or sort of a thing.  For people who are so blessed that they don't become stumped or stymied in the face of moral truths.</p>

                                    <p>It doesn't many any sense because it doesn't.  The whole 'might is right' simply doesn't make any sense, at all.  Trying to make sense of it will do your head in.  Taser to the brain, like that.  So...  In these days where speech is not free Dawkins and others can pronounce and proclaim selflishness and set genetic selfishness up as a God.  That is acceptable.  Preachign that Australasians are not behaviorally modern is okay, as well.  That there isnt' an training and apprentiseship system.  Puzzling about how varoius things could possibly have evolved (when, of course they didn't because there isnt' any of that kind of thing in these lands that function as a socially engineered offshoot of Harry Harlows Primate Research Laboratory).  All of that is acceptable to the peple who decide of what we are allowed to speak freely.  The zombia army of NY.  That's acceptable.  The ideal of an army of zombies that are not conscious at all.  I suppose because then it doesn't matter what you do to them.  PUt them in body bags and line the streets with them when it's time to graduat eand pay them.  Right?  It's okay to freely speak about this, as well.  I seem to be allowed permitted (if not encouraged) to slave away on the promotion of slavery campaign!  Let's normalise slavery and pedophilia and various thigns like that.  That can be my contribution towards the prevention and prohibitnion of development programme. That can be a good unpaid slabor for me.  Slave labor.  slave labor of hate.  What shall we abbreviate ethat to...  How to normalise the Glue Factory.  Roll out the Glue Factory more widely...  The function of psychiatry.  When tehre is no medicine.  No co-operation.  When teh governments have declared war on all the people the people can only output no speak english gaslighting garbage garbage garbage.  What's that Jacinda??  All eyes on me!  Spread your legs for Chris Hipkins Minister of Everything Everybody!  All Heil God Professor Doctor Saint Ashley!  There's nothing here...</p>

                                    <p>Isn't this a nasty nasty business of a nasty nasty game?  Where what the people want is to see Stuart McCutcheon dead in his coffin, already.  The opportunity to take fingernail scrapings of him and his sons to arrange independent DNA test.  Where they want his teeth to  check that it was his particular body that was allegedly burned in the crematorium.  What a nasty nasty game.  What a nasty nasty business.  </p>

                                    <p>Not even trying to make things better (fairer more just) for future generations.  Not even trying to get people playing a different game.  You lose Stuart because you are dead.  If the situation was reversed don't pretend you wouldn't be happy or pleased that I was dead. Think of how many studnets lives or careers you were willing to sacrifice for your own personal advantage.  When they trusted you and when they worked hard for your institution.  But now you lose because you are dead.  And you will be remembered for the awful leader that you were and various people would love to turn out for your funeral and check that it's really you.  I have never in my whole life wanted to go to a funeral more than I now want to go to yours.  I look forward to Lumsden and Sterelny's one day.  I hope they enjoyed their nasty bruitish and short little lives that they had.  I don't suppose any of them will be remembered at all well.  Why would they be?  How could they be?  Did they leave the world better or worse or much the same?  MOtivated and inspired or shut things down?</p>

                                    <p>I really don't want to play their nasty little game.  Psychiatry isn't supposed to be about treating the involuntary.  When I call them psychopaths I don't mean that I should be made psychiatrist and they should be placed under my control.  I mean they should be convicted for their crimes and they should probably be removed from society or positions within society where they have opportunity to cause great mischief.  For the good of society.  We don't have psychiatry.  We don't have Medicien.  Because we won't uphold informed consent.  We don't have people because we don't have human values...  Persons...  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  Indistinguishable from computer programmes.  Twitter bots.  Etc. These 'people' won't allow things to be any other way.  Did you get my academic work out to externals yet?  Why not?  Not because you are afraid that they will fail me (and you want to see me passed) but quite the opposite in fact.  F*cking psyschopaths.  I mean, where are they going to find the body that they are going to pass off as Stuart McCutcheon?  Whose body are they going to pass off as Stuart McCutcheon?</p>

                                    <p>What happened to the body of the Junior Doctor who murdered the teenage girl who was going to speak out about him having supplied her and her friends with (hospital sourced?) drugs?  Anasthetics and the like?  So that they would party party party with him?  What happened to him?  He was apparently imprisoned.  I don't think there was any inquiry into the role of Professor Glue in how the party drugs were being sourced or supplied to teenagers in the name of Medicine from Dunedin...  Anyway, he apparently died in state care.  In prison.  Where is his body?  How could he possibly have killed himself in state care in prison like that?  It just doesn't seem plausible or likely.</p>

                                    <p>What happened to the Eye Surgeon who was wanted for having told his Sydney hooker that he was going to murder his wife for the insurnce money?  Did the insurnace money get paid out to him, yet?  For the former CE of the...  South Auckland DHB, wasn't it?  WHere did her body go?  What reason do we have to believe that she actually died?  Why die then?  WHat happened with the vaccines etc for south auckland?  Did they skip the country (the both of them) did they?  Where did they go with all the taxpaers dollars?  How much money did he get from all the 'independent consulting' she would have hemomorhaged from the DHB budget into his pocket?  </p>

                                    <p>Why think Dr Leeks is dead?  Where is his body?  Where are his teeth?</p>

                                    <p>Why won't they process my application to enrol by applying their published criterion to my application?  Corruption.  That's why.  Corruption.</p>

                                    <p>Whatever happened with the interpol inquiry into the south african medical doctor being kept in or at HIllmorton?  WHere the husbnd came to NZ with his wife and 2 small girls, he plays orthopedic surgeon for 10 days, they have a funeral, and he skips the country.  Where is he now?  Apparently his wife doesn't get to appear before the courts for her own good.  Corruption.  When was the last time the UN inspectors had unrestricted access to any of the NZ hospitals, prisons, schools?  Corruption. . Not even trying.  No aspect or element of try.  Nothing here.  Nobody home.  Nothing to see.</p>

                                    <p>So, now we know about the potential of the post-modernist essay generator, so it isnt' difficult to imagine an entire thesis generator.  So, now we can understand that the University of Waikato did not make (and the TEC and Univerisites NZ did not approve) an impossible triagle of a qualification.  The timeline goes like this.  Day 1.  Enrolment start date.  This is the day you will need to submit your softbound thesis.  So you need to ensure you have yourself a computer and the abilty to get the document that the AI will generate to the printery to have it softbound and submitted by yourself in partial fulfilment of regualtions for the qualification.  Now, the Univesrity will take 3 months to externally examine it.  The outcome of what they call 'first examination' that they will give you 3 months into your enrolment is that you will now be required to keep up your enrolment for another 6 months (for a total of 9 months enrolment time) making the changes required by external examiners.  So at the 9 month mark you submit your thesis for the second lot of exmination.  Using the previous 6 months to update your random AI generated essay in ways the externals required for them to be okay about signing off on your having completed a research output.  They take 3 months to externally examine it.  That takes us to 12 calendar months (the absolute max the University can keep you enrolled for given that you signed up for a 120 point qualification and worked full time over the calendar year.  THey already make you work in excess of requirements or regulatiosn (which is what they alwayas do).  So...  At that point, of course, there alwys will be at least one typo.  So now the Univesrity can say 'hahahahha you are required to pay us 10 extra weeks of fees (2 1/2 months) else you will never get the qualifiation at all.  Because of a typo.  Comprehend?  Do you underestand how this is not a university?</p>

                                    <p>And now you understand how Ashley Bloomfield can have, conjured up in his honor, a research output within a matter of days, if that is something the 'University' cared to pretend wsa important.  They largely seem to have completely totally and utterly given up any pretence or facade of 'try'.  Their whole thing now appears to be 'and what are you going to do about it'?  A declaration of war on the people, I mean to say. The NZ Government.  Warmongering.  How are the peple of NZ supposed to respond to Ashely Bloomfield being picked out for an excess of half a million dollars per year profefssorship when he has nothing relevant for an academic career in his CV at all.  No publications.  To teaching.  No tutoring.  Never even applied to be enrolle din PHD.  Certainly never wrote one.  Why isn't he registered with the medical counsel to see patients?  Why isn't Ayesha?  What about the Waikato guy?  Shane Reti?  They take up limited number clinical medical professional qualifications..  ANd, what, were graduated on the condition that they never ever ever ever ever receive any paid employment for working in the field?  Is that how it doesn't work?  Seems so.  Now Ashley is going ot go teach 'public health' or 'health policy' is he?  Maybe they coudl put his name on my thesis and get studnets to whitewash it for him?  When they aren't too busy sucking his dick, of course.</p>
