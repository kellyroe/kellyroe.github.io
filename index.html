    <p>'One of the issues which has been identified by the network is that the NCEA results in rural areas are limiting the pool of prospective students'.  https://www.odt.co.nz/opinion/editorial/rural-gp-training-proposal-welcome 
    </p>

    <p> They are throwing away applications, and then crying about how they don't have enough.  The Education and Training Act states that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible to be enrolled in the programme they have applied for.  But they throw their applications away because they want wide eyed teenagers who will do anything anything anything before tossing them away.
    </p>

    <p>
    They are refusing to train a new generation of GPs because new GPs will get a job only over the dead bodies of the old GPs and the old GPs have no intention of dying for the next 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 or 100 years and so they have no intention of training new GPs.  I mean, why would anybody voluntariliy choose to give up their payroll?  It doesn't make any sense.  And why would they sign off on completion of training from someone who might be paid instead of them.  WHy would they set themselves up for potentially having less money.  It doesn't make any sense.
    </p>

    <p>Rinse and repeat for everything else.  We don't have any teachers, nurses, lawyers, judges, police, plumbers, electricians.  It's soooooo competitive.  Nobody applies to do those things.  Nobody graduates from those qualifications.  Nobody applies for those jobs.   Nobody is on payroll to work those jobs.  Just a  bunch of 60 or 70 or 80 year olds on 3x or 4x the payroll while they take the 'work' outputs of the younger ones (who pay the university who pay the university who pay the university who pay who pay who pay for their 'training')...  All the ones kept on government welfare (less than minimum wage)...  Take all the 'work' outputs until the day that they die.  Apparently it's sooooooooo competitive.  There will be a job for me only over however many dead bodies.  Waiting waiting waiting for the bodies to die.  Allllll the payroll for them.  ALlllll the payroll for them.  ALlllll the payroll for them.  Allll of the payroll for them.</p> 

    <p>The courts have ruled that the universities don't have to examine studnets work.  They don't have to get their work to externals.  They don't have to give students qualifiations when they have done the work for them.  The secondary schools don't have to either.  I mean, it doesn't matter how well you score in your NCEA examinations if your teachers want to collect up more and more and more money for keeping you enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled then they don't have to pass you.  Why would they pass you?  Why wouldn't they pass all and only the ones who cannot function independently.  That's a great idea.  That way they can be sure that they are the only ones on payroll.  All of the payroll for them.  All of the payroll for them.  But what payroll?  Australian Payroll no work for New Zealand teachers.  Australian Payroll  no work.  Keeping of slaves...  The Univesrities are blatently functioning as slave prison or detention camps.  They aren't employing people willing and able to do research.  They are intentionally employing people who are unwilling and or unable to do research.  They knowingly put people on payroll with the intent that they will refuse to graduate students so as to keep slaves hostages prisoners.  There's nothing in Australasia.  Unless you want to be a slaver.  Prison guard.  Keeper of hostages.  Micro-manage other people's work me-wards only for allll of the payroll nd alll of the credit for you.  That's how come they can re-deploy people so easily..  There is no difference.  It's all the same.  The keeping of hostages and slaves.  Train in one thing and get less payroll for doing something different entirely.  Qualifications not acknowledged anymore . Only given in the first place because they never would be.  ALl of the honorary degrees only that don't mean anything at all.  There's nothing to see...  It doesn't matter what the laws are because the courts refuse to uphold the laws.  THey won't write fair examination scripts or even if they do they won't fairly examine the work tkhat has been done.  They won't blind grade work on it's academic merits.  ALl the energy and effort and time and expense that goes into the keeping of slaves.  The lowest value economy in the world.  By design.  The leaders seem determined to keep it so.  The courts seem to think their job or role is to compound injustices only.  There's nothing here.</p>

    <p>How many old people do we want in rural communities?  Well, then.  Just put a bunch of murdering pedophile psychopaths out there as community leaders and let them gnaw each other to death.  Problem solved.  Then we can declare theis land terra nullus and everywhere else lin teh world can send their undesirables here.  Teh arse end of nowhere.  Nothing here.  All of the medical experiments can be done on the peple down here.  It's sooooooo competitive.  Soooooooo competitive.  Sooooooo competitive.  How many FTE's was Ailsa Claire, again?  MOre than half  million to do what?  To keep hostages and cry cry cry cry cry to the government for more money.  How many FTE's was the VC of the University of Auclkand?  More than half a million to do what?  To keep hostages and cry cry cry cry cry to the government for more money.   How many FTE's was Una Jagose again?  NOtice a common theme here?  HOw many people 'don't count' for the purposes of rates of unemployment?  How many people are actully paid to work full time jobs in New Zealand?  There is really nothing here...  I guess they will be paying people in bitcoin soon.  Because states aren't allowed to print their own money / mint their own coin.  But, of course, the NZ dollar is ordered to be printed by Australia, I belive.  To disguise and conceal that they don't pay New Zealanders Australian wages.  Keeping people gnawing each other to death over scraps.  Wasteland.  Indeed.  But the worst of it is the energy and effort nd time nd expense that goes into ensuring that  this is so and this is how it must remain.  No hint of 'try'.  No good deed goes unpunished in these lands.</p>
