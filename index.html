 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->

                            <article>
                                <p>I mean.  The thing is.. YOu go... It's a meritocracy -- right?  And they hire these people and they hire those peole and they hire that person.  ANd their research output is, uh.  Nothing.  So, uh, anybody who outputs a research output is outperforming them, then, right?  I mean, how hard can it possibly be when they currently employ people for research posts when those people have no research outputs.  I mean...  Inkow it's a small country and all...  Uh...  How hard can it possibly be?  That they hire this that and the other person and they don't do any ofthe very most bsic things associated with their job descritpin?  Well, uh, f*cking welcome to NZ.  All and only the most incompetent expendible uterly replaceable and useless need apply . Will get to be on payroll etc.  ffs.  Tower of bable.  garbage output land.  Nobody home.  Nothing here.  Nothign to see.  Don't get sick now, y'hear?  All and only those who you most value get to do anything anything anything with teh likes of you.  You wouldn't have things any other way.</p>

                                <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/world/482322/chatgpt-appears-to-pass-medical-school-exams-educators-rethinking-assessments  Well, there we go.  Idoit imbecel land (NZL) run by robots.  AI.  Whatever whatever from overseas.  documenting the crimes of the AI robots.  Nobody home.  Clearly it isn't personal, at all.  Why do they pay Ashley Bloomfield more than half a million dollars, again?  Sure they do.  yeah.  right.</p>

                                <p>I hear you that there wasn't a 'wow' for Breath of the Wild that you had in other Zelda games.  That's nice to hear, because it helps them sell other Zelda games.  I hear you say the world was lifeless and the puzzled were repetitive.  I have sympathy for that pov.  I said 'I think he is missing a Korok seed' but I take his point that the puzzles seem repetitive so that the world can still feel empty even though there are repeated puzzles.  Re the weapon durability system...  What other games do you think did that well?  Encouraging people / forcing people to try weapons outside their comfort zone.  What games do you think did that well?  Where you felt that you were given the right amount of encouragement / force to try and persist and learn to get good with weapons that might be outside your comfort zone?  Then I might have more understanding of where you are coming from in criticising Zelda for not being that.  Please try Harry Potter.  The game developers have allowed you to make a character who is trans -- if you cared to.  And place that character into a witch or wizard dormitory of your own choosing.  And I don't think they will penalise you in game play for being black looking or asian looking or trans looking or for speaking with an 'inappropriately' masculine or feminine voice..  You can make whatever choices you want -- right?  So...  You can be all 'black lives matter' and play a trans character if you choose or want.  To shut the community up..  Or to honor different voices..  Or whatever you want to do.  I do understand that you were into Fallout and sci fi sorts of things..  Temple of Elemental Evil was one of the few games I completed (one of the few you did not).  But plse play Harry Potter..  As a girl or a trans guy or whatever you think you could play as in order to just focus on the game on it's merits..  I don't know.  Play a trans guy and Slytherin them all to hell, if you want.  Whatever.  Right?  I mean, how could you possibly think there isn't a role for that in academia.  Etc.. Right??</p>

                                <p>I mean, instead of a weapon durability system you could have a limited ammunition system.  Right?  So your gun didn't poof...  But the ammo did.  Are you okay about that, then?  Psychologically that kind or sort of a weapon durability system is okay?  Plse explain more...</p>

                                <p>https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2023/01/alleged-fraudulent-auckland-university-graduate-practised-psychiatry-in-uk-for-19-years-court-hears.html</p>

                                <p>Likely they wouldn't have hired her at all if they didn't think that she was a fraud.  I would imagine that when you are keeping institutions that are not even pretending to be theraputic so that you can torture people, effectively, and keep them punatively in conditions the UN would likely say amount to torture, then you have a certain special kind of staffing problem.  Wouldn't you say?  How are you going to find people willing to commit atrocities?  Or, at the very very least, willing to turn a blind eye to atrocities being committed by others?  I would imagine that you would have to find people willing to do anything anything anything anything.  Really train them up.  Teach them all about 'the other' and how badly you will treat them if they don't comply.
                                </p>

                                <p>Why are they going after her now?  All of a sudden?  What happened for them to declare her to be a fraud now, all of a sudden?  Time for them to pay her, was it?</p>

                                <p>The Calendar Regulations say they can hold you back for 1  year (make you repeat 1 year) of Medical School.  It does not make sense, therefore, that she would have dropped Medicine entirely after being failed for 1 year of the course when repeating the year (so the University can get more fees from you) is something that they do.  In fact, Didn't 1/3rd (at least) of the Medical Cohort of University of Otago fail their internship which meant their Degree was withheld?  They had recieved signoff from their internship placement but the University didn't accept that it was sending them to placements that the University would acknowledge (accused them not of paying bribes for sign off but of not doing enough work even though they had been signed off).  They wanted them to take up their junior doctor positions in the NZ hosptials, anyway, but they weren't going to pay them their junior doctor salary.  THey were going to need to keep paying the university.</p>

                                <p>There aren't that many psychiatrists in the world.  If she was accepted to train as a psychiatrist in the UK and she practiced in fact it is disingenuous to think or say that nobody knew of her or remembered her as having failed out if she did fail out in fact.</p>

                                <p>They intentionally select criminals so that they don't pay them.  Then they move them around so that again, they don't pay them.  Also, the whole doing anything anything anything anything anything.  Keeping people in punative conditions of torture and so on and so forth.  Nobody there.  Nothing home.</p>

                                <p>The USA has STEP examinations.  STEP 1 is a basic science subject knowledge test of medical science.  STEP 2 is clinical subject knowledge test of medical science.  STEP 3 is a mock clinical examination.  So that they can ensure that they only take people who try and give sexual health examinations to the toddlers and who don't ask informed consent etc.  Whatever it is that they value for wherever it is they want to deploy 'medical workforce' to manage the prison and detention camps, I would suppose.  Check what they have to say about how to write up patient notes to limit health coverage and so on and so forth.  THe UK has something similar, I think.  They don't have the teaching materials that the USA does with respect to at least nominally pretending to have an actual curriculum and examination scores that are some indicator of the curriculum contents that were taught.  She would have passed those exams in order to practice in the UK at all?  And she would have practiced in the UK for a couple years before being selected to Psychiatry.  It really isn't plausible to think that when a place is thinking of hiring someone they don't get people to contact the Univeristy that the person is from.  I mean to say, Martin Davies wouldnt' write me a reference to study in the USA because he thought I'd make a  better slave for AUstralia and the USA could just take my work, my research outputs etc etc anyway.  I imagine.  ANd I imagine that Kim Sterelny wants me to go begging and pleading.  People will do anything anything anything anything.  Right?  I wasn't supplicant enough.  Following him around all day like a lost puppy begging him to read my work and do his f*cking job supervising or at least getting the work to externals.  You know how it goes, the slave or prison camp of Australia.  Apparently if Carl spent 2x the normal time doing a PhD -- but then he got a PhD.  Right?  And now he has paid employment?  So they just get you slaving for a while..  ANd eventually they do pay you.   Riiiight.  Suuuuure.  LIke how my doing what Waikato wanted and writing them 2x the thesis over 2x the years meant they recorded that I failed.  ANd they still haven't gotten around to recording me as having been enrolled in the course of study that I actually applied to.  In fact thehy have recorded me being enrolled in a course that isn't even listedn in the University Calendar and doesn't have sensible course-codes.  There are no enrolmetn dated associated with the enrolment.  Indefinite detention.  My student ID card haven'e even expired yet.  Look at the expiration dates on the University of Waikato studnet identification cards that hey give you when you enrol in a 1 year programme of study.  </p>

                                <p>Nobody home.  Nothing there.  Is she getting to testify about atrocities in the hospitals?  Why are they going after her *now*?</p>

                                <p>The 'Universities' of NZ (Haha) are wanting to keep online records only, now.  A potential employer is supposed to put in a records request with the University and the Univeristy will tell that prospective employer whatever they want about you.  SO, for instance, they can tell prospective employers that you are a nasty criminal degenerate if they want you to have no option but to stay and slave for them.  Why would they want to give up their slaves?  And the ones they want to get rid of..  Glowing references, I suppose.  Send off the problems, right? </p>

                                <p>How do you get signed off in NZ when the tutor is teachign you to grope people doing cardiac exams?  How do you get signed off in NZ when the tutor is teachign you to do cervical exams on patients anesthetised for unrelated procedures when they ahve not provided informed consent?  If they won't sign off on your committing atrocies (just like them) then how can you get your qualification from teh 'University'?  What Uniersity?  They are trying to keep more and more and more and more slaves and prisoners in the detention camps up and down the land..  What education and training system? What garduates?  What jobs?  There's nothing there...  Nobody home.</p>

                                <p>They wouldn't accept or acknoweldge when teh studnets had completed things to the satisfacation of international community.  Locally.  They won't accept it.  They say that their studnets are garbage garbage garbage garbage rubbish useless stupid lazy incompetent criminals.  Garbage garbage garbage.  Therefore they must be kept here as slaves.  Kept in teh prison detention camp because it's so fun to abuse them.  Garbage wasteland.  There's nothing here.  THere is nothing at all even trying ot be rehabiliattive or educational or healthy or helpful about any of this.  It's just soooooo cmopetitive.  Poking each others eyes out.  Soooooo cmopetitive.  Soooooo competitive.  Wehre does all the money go?  Of ocurse it's not really about money.  It's about power to do anything anything anything.  HOw some peopel need to feel big about themselves.</p>

                                <p>New Zealadn Universities won't even acknowledge their own qualifications.  So now, I suppose, what's happening is that all the NZ graduates in the world can be recalled to NZ.  Their qualifiations rescinded or taken away.  No longer acknowledged.  The world won't accept NZ qualifications because NZ wont' even accept NZ qualifications.  There's nobody home.  Nothing here.  They dont' have curriculum contents for the exams they have for studnets to go into training places for the specialist colleges.  If I wanted to be a GP then how would I go about being selected for training?  What study materials are there?  What curriculum contents?  USMLE study books?  World question bank questions?  What curriculum contents are there in Australasia?  How do you study for exams?  What's that?  YOu suck their dicks all day.  You suck their dicks all day>  You suck their dicks all day and maybe they choose you!  For whatever arbitrary personal non-professional reasons that they have.  They jsut choose you!  How to staff the prison slave detention camps.  Quite the conundrum.  </p>

                                <p>Not even trying to be any different / any better.  Will not train a workforce.  Takes the people struck off from everywhere else.  The criminals etc etc from overseas.  Takes them so it can pass them off for a time and then refuse to pay them.  Say they are criminals and frauds.  The Waikato hospital has on at least 2 occasions hd articles in the Waikatko Times about them finding our or declaring that someone on payroll as psychiatrist is delcared a fraud.  One of them was apparently an impersonator who never went to medical school or did any training at all. And apparently nobody could tell that he hadn't done any training at all.  Nobody could tell.  I guess that tells you something about the quality of our training system.  WHen tehy can't tell the difference  between a graduate from a NZ University (yeah right) and a fraud from overseas.  The great fraud upon all of the people.  WEe don't have an education and ttraining system.  There isn't any point studying because they don't examine things fairly.  They won't do it.  THey are only interested in keeping slaves.</p>

                                <p>It's great, hey.  People would rather employ criminals and violent offenders and fraudsters and so on from overseas..  Than allow the likes of me to do it.  The choices the people in power make, hey.  What it is that htey value.  They would rather have criminals come here from overseas and throw all of the NZ qualifictions away.  I don't see how we can colelct up money from international studnets.  We aren't processing applciations, progresseions, completions.  We don't acknowledge our own qualifications.  There's really nobody home. Nothing there.  NZ Universities looks at what people are saying about how China is treating the Uyghur in the prison camps in the name of education and training and goes 'we dont' see anyting worng with that it isnt' anything that we are not doing'.  New Zealand...  One of the worst places in teh world in which to have a child or raise a family.  The rates of bullying and violence and abuse and use of force.  People don't feel heard or listened to.  The government treats the people like animals.  Keeps them as slaves.  There's nothign here.  Nobody home.  There is no process of decolonisation.  It's Stanford Prison Experimetn.  Harrry Harlow's Primate Research Laboratory on the nature of hate I mean love I mean helping me helping me helping me help myself to you.  THere's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>Now everybody stop for a moment.  Let's just take a minute...  To celebrate Harlene Hayes!  She was promoted to the 'University' of Western Australia to expediate the selection of 18 year old teenagers into the 'Medical Programme' (yeah right) over there.  But only after she recorded that 1/3rd the Medical Cohort of Otago was having their qualifications withheld because the Univesrity did not acknoweldge the internships that the University had set up for them to go on.  I don't know how many of the students who stayed in NZ to do local internships also had their qualifications withheld.  I would imagine that anybody notn willing to commiit Dr Leeks or Dr Green sorts or kinds or types of atrocities would no longer be welcome to do Medicien in NZ. And I really can't imaagien that they are giong to pay anybody for committing atrocites. That's the kind of thing that people pay you for the privalede of.  Right?  They will need to figure out their own way to make money off of the victims in the 'hospitals'.</p>

                                <p>Let's all take a moment to revere teh right honorable Dr Leeks.  And, of course, a moment to reflect upon the qualifications and credentials of Ashley Bloomfield, recently made PRofessor of the Univesrity of Auckland.  He is a Dr in virtue of having graduated (they say he graduated -- but the Medical Profession won't register him to work with patients?) the Medical Programme.  That's an undergraduate level degree.  THey won't let you live in graduate student accommodation because they say it's an undergraduate level degree.  He is not a 'doctor' because he did a PhD or an MD. He doesn't have research, teaching, tutoring, grading expereince.  He has experience of ordering the nation to an unlawful lockdown where the courts say that he can do anything anything anyting.  So he's professor now.  That's what it means to be professor in NZ.  They chose him!  Not because he did his job..  Even...  But because they like and value him.  Revere him as a God, even.  Most strange...</p>

                                <p>That's kind of why I genuinely don't understand why Auckland didn't just enrol me in MBChB.  What is to stop them simply flunking me out, like they did for Population Health 101?  Just saying that I failed?  Of course, you probably want to get people taking the maximum time first (paying maximum fees).  That would be 7 years of fees to do the 6 year programme?  The Calendar says they can get to to repeat one year.  But then, I guess, the idea is that they will say that they will fail you out of the qualification entirely unless you bring your performance up and that's going to necessitate you paying an awful lot of money for private tuition or whatever offered by the Univerity or place like Crimson Education (blood on their hands, for sure).  It's quite the scummy scam.  Just so that New Zealanders and Australians also can understand the reasons why they don't have access to timely quality medical care.  It's because of the Governments preference for bullying and abusing and keeping slaves.  Keeping the people detained in conditions of torture and so on.  It's just so fun to play Stanford Prison Experiment.  It's sooooo competitive!  And if you don't want to play guard (and bully and abuse and eliminate and so on) then you can be our favorite detainee, then!  There aren't any doctors or teachers or professors or anything really anything at all because of the psychoapths who are having so very much fun of the eway things are.  They won't allow things to be any other way.  Don't worry..  THey get sick eventually.  Their nasty bruitish and short little lives will be over.  But not  because they've made things as bad as they can for everybody else along the way.</p>

                                <p>Or maybe the University of Auckland updated their student records to say that Ashley Bloomfield was enrolled in their PhD programme and graduated from their University with a PhD some time within the last 5 years.  Apparently they have the power to declare that any grades or qualifications completed from New Zealand more than 5 years ago will no longer be acknowledged.  But, you know, all entirely at their discretion.  Just whatever they want for whatever they choose to value.</p>

                                <p>Universities the world over are..  Choosing to apoptose, or something.  If you look at University webpages what you see, increasingly, is no research.  Often you can't even find the employees who are on payroll to do teaching and research work.  I mean to say, you can't find out who is actually employed to teach and research in the departments.  There will be lists and lists and lists of administration and administrators, however.  The University has been taken over by overtaken by people taking all the money out all eyes on them all eyes on them all eyes on them.  There isnt' anything left.  What curriculum contents?  Some peopel teach what they were taught.  No new curriculum contents have been developed.  Else the curriculum contents involves teaching studnets to reason indistinguishably from bots about the output of bots kinds of classes or courses.  So they can tell people they don't have the capacity to think critically or reason they are garbage garbage garbage.  Theyw ill need to reenroll and reenroll and reenroll and never stop handing over work outputs in exhange for no qualifications that will be acnowledged.  Quite the scummy scam of the prison camp land.  What people on payroll?  What University?  What research?  What teaching?  What employees?  Are they going to hold a graduation ceremony for Ashley belatedly?  Or will they just update his student records and pretend like he had a PhD all along.  What PhD will they see fit to attribute to him?  What will it be about do you suppose?  ABout the great plan to have more and more and more people be enrolled in his qualification degree programme graduation planned for never.</p>

                                <p>Quite the tower of babel land.  Most underproductive economy ever.  What economy?  Australia orders NZ dollars (states are not allowed to mint their own coin) to be printed in Canada.  Hey, the politicians don't need payrises.  You can just reduce the number of FTE positions that are actually filled with actual people and pay peple less and less and less and less and less and less and less.  Just so long as you get to peck peck peck peck peck everyone else to death you must be doing it right.  Sure.  Great.  Yay you!!  You go Lord God Ashley!!  Alll of the money and titles for you!!!!  You didn't even need to apply for the job.  Right?  They just made up a job just for you.  That's how much they love you and everything it is that you do...</p>

                                <p>Isn't this a great 'job' for me?  Isn't this terrific?  The great mis-management that is New Zealanad.  The state of New Zealand.  New Manus Island.  WHere the Research Output of Manus Island was higher than the Research Output of the University of Waikato (or likely New Zealand).  Cry cry cry cry cry about unlawful detention.  That's all we get to do.  Cry cry cry cry cry.  Oh Lord God Ashley!  Have mercy on the 20 virgins enrolled in your course!!!  Choose to use your discretion to do anything anything anything...  WHy wouldn't they register you to work with patients?  There was more money in administration, no doubt.  More money for Ayesha, too.  Who will they register to work with patients, then?  Who will they register?  I imagine there will be a dossier on each registrant carefully handpick selected for the ease with which they will be accused of being a fraud or whatever and imprisoned if they complain bout not being paid.  I would imagine that that's the real pre-requisite for getting to play doctors and nurses in New Zealand.  Playing professors now, are we?  Dr Ashley.  Phd.</p>

                                <p>Maybe what I was supposed to do was walk away after 3 years.  Then apply for jobs and tell them that I completed my PhD.  Then they put in an inquiry with the Universiy and the University gets to tell met that if I don't pay them x dollars by y date then they will say they have never heard of me.  Or they will say fibsies about me.  What should you have to do in order to get a nice good or sensible reference from your supervisor?  I bet they want to say that only the real criminal degenerate no hopers who didn't do any of the things they were paid to do wouldn't get a reference to say that they had done the work if they did the work they were contracted to do in fact.  But that's not true.  Martin Davies wouldn't write me a reference after I did everyting he asked me to do over the summer scholarship period.  He put in a word for me so that I would be accepted back to the ANU to write them a thesis...  But they wouldn't write me references for my having done that either.  You can add up the words that I did in my first 2 years by seeing the written seminars over on the writing page.  That's work I did in the first 2 years.  They should have bundled it and got it to externals.  The externals could have suggested 6 months of changes to get it done.  If Sterelny is too lazy or psychopathic or stupdi or whatever he is to do his f*cking job.  Garbage 'University' hey.  Not even trying to pretend to be one.  I was good enough for them to have me as a summer scholar and for them to have me back to do a PhD but they would never put in a word for me to be able to do anything other than be Sterelny's little b*tch. What's that Sterelny,  you need a housesitter?  You want to go camping?  Are you ready to take out your f*cking pen and provide comments on my academic work?  No?  F*cking psychopath, hey.  Alllllll of the research funding for you to not do philosophy.  Great.</p>

                                <p>I mean..  Ashley decided that he wanted to be a Professor soooooo much that he was prepared to make personal sacrifies.  He applied to the PhD programme.  He wrote a research proposal and found himself a supervisor and everything.  He walked away from his three quarters of a million dollar paid government position in order to study for his PhD full time.  And he dedicated himself to his writing.  Doing the work for the PhD.  He went to whatever supervisory meetings he was required to go to.  He did all this PhD thesis milestones.  He submitted a thesis for external examination.  The external examiners signed the forms that they were supplied  by the University and he was informed that he had completed the requiremetns in fact and he was to graduate.  Congradulations Ashley!  Congrats!  Then he applied for jobs...  Paid positions...  And I guess something came through for him.  And he was paid to be lecturer.  ANd then he did so well in his teaching and researching and so on for him to be promoted to associate professor.  And now he  has made professor!  Congradulations Ashley!  Congrats!  You made it Ashley!  You made Professor!  That's what it meeeeeeeans to be professor!  Now I'm sure all the sacrifies you made in order to get to train and study to be and become Professor seem worth it.  Worthwhile.  You can congrdulate yourself and pat yourself on the back for a job well done.  All yuor personal sacrifies for your goal really paid off.  Not financially, of course.  Walking away from a three quarters of a million dollar government salary in order to undertake further education and training..  That is not a decision that many or most people would make.  ONly a very very few people would choose to do something like that.  Oh, but they are stupid slave chumps who must be taken for fool.  Of course.  ALllllll of the everything for the Lord God Civil Servant showing us what it means to serve teh people.  Yeah, right.  F*cking farce.  There isn't anybody there.  Nobody home.</p>

                                <p>Oh, but of course, if you find a person who would do that..  Who would give up a paid position as an academic in order for an opportunity to undergo further education and training...  Then greedy grubby eyes light up..  About how you can force everyone to retrain, then.  Just keep paying the university just keep paying the university just keep paying the University.  Maybe Ashley or the University or the Media was simply getting a little ahead of themselves when tehy accounced Ashley to be Professor at the Univesrity of AUckland.  Maybe they meant to say he was the receipient of a PhD scholarship to study for his PhD?  Or maybe they simply meant to report that he had chosen to enrol there as a full fee paying studnet because one day he hoped to make Professor.  That must be it..  Else..  Well.  Otherwise they have simply chosen to declare that there is no University at all.  I mean to say, if Ashley can be Professor (without a PhD) then think who else can be made Professor.  Professor of Obgyn and Professor of Psychiatry and Professor of General Practice and Professor of Surgery etc etc etc.  Just anybody who they choose to call that.  For any arbitrary reasons at all. Maybe (probably) simply whoever pays the most money to the Univeristy in exhange for getting to do anything anything anything for a while...  ANd now, of course, we've actually met the actual employees of the 'Education and Training Programmem' that is Medicine and Surgery in NZ.  That is or means to say there isn't anybody there.  Nobody home.  Most of them probably never were enrolled in Medical School and / or if they were they never were graduated and if they were they never were paid to practice Medicine etc.  They are simply there to teach the 'hidden curriculum' in order to find those who will keep their mouths shut about atrocities and who will work to keep mostest hostages in the prison slave detention camps.  Who can make the most money for the univeristy or medical system.  Nobody home.  I think that makes the very best sense of why they refuse to process my applciation.  Because they already know I do not possess the qualities they most value.  I passed the ethics test which means I failed to meet their expectations of them choosing to select for Dr Leeks 2.0.  Etc.</p>

                                <p>Of course the whole thing is a scam, so far as I can see.  They think they get all the EFTS they can get from students -- 7.  The MBChB is 6 years -- but they will always fail you for one year so as to collect up 7 years of fees.  Why wouldnt' they?  That's, effectively, free money for them.  Keeping studnets enrolled for another year.  Teaching them a little lesson in how they must be willing to do anything anything anything else they won't say that they graduated at all.  But, of course, the bullying and abuse doesn't stop there.  That's just the start of it.  I got how many years of bullying and abuse from Philosophy?  For how many years have I done graduate level research?  Waikato got 1 year of honors for me then 2 years of 120 point Masters.  Then ANU got how many years of PhD enrolment?  They got at least 6 years for Carl, wasn't it?  I think at some point Kim Sterelny was boasting about 10?  Having or keeping him as a PhD student for 10 years?  Saying that that was the maximum they could keep him for, before they would be required to give him his PhD for the work he had done...  Then Auckland said that they declared me 'ineligible' for Medicien unless I completed a New qualification from a NZ University.  THey did not have the authority to misadvise me.  They told me garbage lies and as a result I worked for 2 years of research for the Univesrity of Waikato as a full fee paying student with no scholarship.  Then I'm expected to spend the next however long slaving for the courts while waiting for death.  There's nothing here.   There's really nothing there...  They won't graduate the studnets.  But even if they do they won't employ them.  They will never pay them for the work they do.  They hire mismanagers to mismanage the funds mewards only.  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>They say I didn't choose to give up a job in academia as a philosopher in order to pursue medicine because they say they never would have graduated me from a PHD in philosophy, anway. I was good enough for them to enrol for how many years of graduate level research in the field?  I was soo good...  Sooo productive..  That they would never graduate me. Look at the research outputs of the people on payroll to research.  That's what you need to output to be on payroll.  Nothing.  You get paid to keep studnet slaves.  You get paid becuase you don't have the willingness or abiltiy to do any f*cking work your f*cking self.  What doctors in the hospitals?  What professors in the Uniersities?  What judges in teh courtrooms?  There's nothign here.</p>

                                <p>Where are you going to live while you do your PhD in Auckland, Ashley?  Are you going to live in University Accommodation or try and support your wife living off of your Graduate Living Stipend off campus somewhere?  </p>
