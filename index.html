 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>Well, that's right of course.  We must be forced to live like retarded monkeys raised in laboratory cages.  Socially engineer the environment to make it so.  Off you go.</p>

                                <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/487751/strikes-protests-and-collective-action-how-fighting-a-cost-of-living-crisis-wasn-t-always-about-tightening-your-own-belt  Hmm...  Here's a plan.  Firstly, make union membership compulsory.  Tell people (e.g., studnets) that they have to pay sixty dollars per year, or whatever, in compulsory union fees.  Then the union will have lots of money.  What will they do with it?  Hire a bunch of incompetents to lord their salaries over and above the students.  Then, after people have come to resent their union as being a bunch of incompetent free-riders, you can make union membership voluntary.  People have a bad taste in their mouths about what unions are and they don't want to pay them sixty dollars for no good reason.  So the union shrinks.  So then the government doesn't need to worry about the union doing anything for students.  And the unions can cry cry cry to the government for more food that they can distribute to the students.  So they can put them back to doing their supervisors work, of course, so the supervisors can take all the research money and go off on holiday and family trips while passing off a copy-paste verison of their first year studnets work as their own.  Or the thesis they got given from someone overseas to grade (where the idea is to fail it and then, once the student has been bullied into fleeing, pass it off as your own).  That sounds like something really worth working towards.  Hahaha.  Sooooo clever.  How motivating and inspiring.  Don't you want to join them?  If you aren't patting yourself on the back for being soooo clever and better than everybody else then I guess that makes you a loser.  Haha.  Who wouldn't want to join them?</p>

                                <p>I think it likely that people who have some fond memories for lower socio-economic schools were kids who were streamed within those schools to higher ability / children of the adminisration streams.  If streaming goes away then the administration will simply send their kids to different schools. Take control of 'the other'.  I guess they were treating the high ability kids pretty badly, anyway, since they were just supposed to be the little b*tches for their own children.</p>

                                <p>I'm trying to imagine what it might be like..  Being picked out all special-like to go to Harvard as a teenager.  On scholarship, I suppose.  So Harvard is not requiring you to have levels of debt recorded against your name in exhange for you being enrolled in something where, if you do the work, you are supposed to be given recognition that you have done the work (a qualification) 4 years later.  For an undergrad degree.  5 years later.  For a PhD.  2 years later for a 2 years masters programme.  It isn't that you have to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and do the work and still be enrolled decades later...  What kind of training system is that?  The f*cking slavery system of Australasia.  Anyway..  So..  You arive.  And it's twin-share rooms.  Right?  So..  Uh..  You get to be the b*tch of some kid who is..  'Don't you know why my Father is?  You better do anything anything anything I say else I'll have you kicked out of this University!'  How..  Uh...  Motivating and inspiring.  I mean..  I'm trying to understand how such a thing is supposed to actually go...  It doesn't really seem to make any sense...</p>

                                <p>NZ will not train a health workforce.  They aren't processing applications to enrol.  They aren't signing off on graduations.  Won't do it.  Won't pay the workers.  Insist on payrolling various people who..  Uh...  Keep slaves.  That seems to be it.  Can re-deploy the worse than f*cking useless around.  Garbage land.</p>

                                <p>I was reading this article about how the students are working full-time while they are enrolled in University because they can't afford to study (and many of them are under the age of 20 which means they are still entitled to a free secondary school education in NZ).  So they are working full time, in some instances, while they are being enrolled in the univeristy.  So that, you know, increasing levels of debt can be recorded against their names.  But that's not the end to it.  See..  I was enrolled in courses with some of these studnets.  And while many of them were not going to lectures, were not going to tutorials, were not doing their readings (maybe because they were working) they were being given passing grades for being enrolled in the course.  Whereas it was me (who was attending all the lectures, doing all the readings) who was recorded by the university as having 'failed'.  Failed:  Population health first year.  Who fails first year population health?  Anybody other than me?  What University.  That's a selector for Medicine.  What Medicine?  What health system?  Ask Ayesha how many Malaysian nurses are being redeployed here, I guess.  So they can take their wages and hand them over to the 'universities' in order for them to be re-enrolled in training programmes of the no speak english.  More than 4 months after a hearing of the social security appeals authority but the tribunal  has been off sick.  They have been off on holiday.  No judgement.  Nada.  What administration?  F*cking scummy scam farce of a sh*t show.  Nobody home.  F*cking die, already.</p>

                                <p>Chris Hipkins deeclares what is happening in Ukraine to be unlawful.  Without a trial.  Guilty until proven innocent, right Chris?  We don't need to pay lawyers to conduct a fair trial.  We can just ask you what you think.  All independently-like.  I'm sure you are highly educated to independence of foreign policy.  We independently choose to be excluded from having anything at all to do witih nuclear submarines, and the like.  Our nuclear physicists have all been re-deployed to epidemeology.  We got our neurosurgeons and we thought they would make better taxi drivers.    I guess our 'students' are too busy cry cry cry cry crying about how they have to do their supervisors work full time so that they can be paid less tham minimum wage to be enrolled with the university so that their supervisors can be too busy going off on holiday and having family time to get their work out for external examination for the qualification they were enrolled in.  We don't need a trial, anyway.  We can get the 65 +++ year old retired judges to take judgments written by first years that were submitted to turnitin.  Outputs of Turnitin can be presented as judgments.  'There could be no evidence that would attest to x'.  Tornado.  Hurricane.  Weather bomb.  Weather bomb.  Weather bomb. We don't know how lucky we are!  If only we knew, right, Chris?  If only we knew how lucky we were.  Everything kept empty to preserve the social hierarchy.  Over their dead bodies, apparently.  Wish they'd f*cking well hurry up and die, then.  They wouldn't have things any other way. What the hell is a 'competitive health workforce' supposed to look like?  Who is the enemy, again?  What is the competition?  What are we competing against?  What health system?  What education system? What judiciary?  There's nothing there.  It's sooooooo competitive.  Gnawing each others arms off.  F*cking die, already.  Get out of the f*cking way.  All the freeriders on payroll. What's your f*cking research output, again?  F*cking die, already.    </p>



                                <p>Make it easier *for who* to change the sex on the birth certificate?  NZ is often a social experiment.  It's where you send the psychopaths off to do experiments on other people's kids.  See what kids you can find.  Heavy hand their parents into handing the kids over to someone on NZ government payroll.  E.g., Dr Leeks.  Have them volunteered or donated to live in government institutions.  By keeping the parents sufficiently destitute and deprived, often.  The strategy, I mean.  Of why the government needs to take custody of the kids.  Then pay someone to abuse them so they can do longitudinal observational studies on abuse.  See what happens when you socialise the boys into being pimped out as girls etc.  See if you can deliver electrical stimulation to their genitals to provoke the kinds of physiological arousals you desire when you desire because you desire.  You or people who pay you -- right Dr Leeks?  Then they can go camping with various people who pay you to take them camping.  Right?  Is that how it goes?  That way the government doesn't even need to pay you directly.  You can make your  money from pimping the kids out.  There's a market for boys to be girls and so on.  Right?  Isn't that the motivational and aspirational ideal as to why it is that we don't need to pay Psychiatrists or Medical Doctors to work, in NZ.  We can simply make do with people re-deployed from overseas to come to NZ and experiment on other people's kids.  Observe them in conditions of abuse and torture and deprivation.  Learned helplessness.  That way we will never need to pay the kids.  They won't even try and escape.  Right?  That's a good idea.  Pats on the back for us.  How great we are.  Better redeploy Dr Leeks to Melbourne and say that he died so that the courts can give teeth to how the courts aren't even trying to uphold justice or fairness at all.  Are they?  What evidence do you see of the courts even trying to be fair?  To find in the interests of justice?  Maybe the reason why NZ won't make the judges direction documents public is because the very point or purpose of the judiciary in NZ is a social experiment in injustice.  In upsidedown and back to font land.  The problem isn't that we are still subscribed to outdated theories of how to do good. The problem is that we are subscribed to theoreies of how to do bad or evil.  Give the kids to the ones most likely to abuse them.  Every time.  Until people learn not to take things to the courts.  It's soooooo competitive in NZ, after all.  WHy would the judges find in the interests of other people's kids?  That doesn't make any sense, at all...  They would only be rivals.  Competitors.  The kids will grow up and want a share of the resources that belong to the judge.  Why would the judge help you?</p>

                                <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/opinion/131711380/josie-pagani--yes-minister-health-is-in-crisis  Well, now, what could explain them thinking they are doing a great job of things?  I guess you need to think about what their aim, purpose, point, or goal is.  If the aim was to kill rural Maaori with cigarettes, for example, then could they be doing a better job of it?  At some point in history didn't they give the natives small-pox infected blankets in an attempt to eliminiate them (because it's soooooo competitive)?  Why would we think that our health system wasn't similarly competitive?  Trying to kill off everybody else's kid.  Or at least sicken them, weaken them a bit.  Kill off everybody else.  Disable them.  Incapacitate them.  It being sooooooo competitive, and all.  The trouble with the ideal of social services is that it requires people to actually be pro-social.  But what evidence is there of that, then?  What evidence is there that the leaders are even trying to be fair, at all?  </p>

                                <p>Jacinda wants to eliminate violent extremism?  Really?  I thought her whole strategy was to encourage it since that is what makes her appear to be at her best.  Didn't she say that she was in virginia when the twin towers were bombed and she became motivated and inspired by how the people who were so very divided over politics before all game together in their grief and disbelief and mourning.  They turned to the political leaders for words of comfort.  Instead of having vitriole against the leaders the vitriole was directed towards the person who was named to be 'terrorist'.  And Jacinda wanted in on that action.  So, then, there needs to be 'terrorists' or 'terrorist-like activity' so that she can comfort the people.  Right?  So they can be comforted by her.  So the likes of Brian Tamaki need to be locked up in Mt Eden so that nobody can vote for him because he's clearly a terrorist threat to the New Zealand Government...  Uh..  Yeah...  Baby shark do do do do do do baby shark. The Government was really trembling in it's boots about the violent terrorists.  Really genuinely very afraid.  Yeah they were.  Of course.  That's why they locked up a bunch of people.  To protect the people against the violent extremists.  Do do do do do do.  Yeah, right.</p>

                                <p>'The Christchurch Call' is a social experiment in how under conditions of urgency urgency it's an emergency the government takes more and more and more powers for itself to not do proper process to not do proper consultation.  To pass laws in the stealth of the night.  I don't really understand the role that Jacinda played (or if she was merely reading the teleprompts) telling the graduates of Harvard that they wouldn't be prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus in NZ (so destination for all their knock-out gene studies).  Nobody was prosecuted when abortion was a criminal offense.  But more in particular, that was her chosen way of informing the people of NZ that the abortion laws had been changed by stealth without any public consultation on the issue whatsoever.  Not even trying to be a democratic country following proper process at all.  Not even trying to be.</p>

                                <p>I guess...  All the work that Helen Clarke did marketing and advertising NZ as the best place in the world to come and abuse kids.  Then Jacinda with all the work she did marketing and advertising NZ as the best place in the world to come keep slaves.  Not pay the workers.  Wrongful inprisonment.  Keep the entire nation in lock-down.  Except for Professor Ashley and Jacinda who get to travel about to give press releases and the like.  Rolling out ration boxes...  The governments declare war on the people.  At least we know the function of the health system, now.  The Ministry of Sickness and Disease.  That makes good sense of how it is that they can't / won't process applications to enrol, progressions through training, completions of training.  Won't employ anybody to work those jobs.  Sing sing sing the praises of Dr Leeks.  The only game in town.  There is no alternative.  By design.  Come to NZ everybody!  Real destination!  Not even trying to be fair at all.  There for the taking.</p>

                                <p>What is the aim of Tertiary Education, in New Zealand?  Is it to ensure that the people currently on payroll never need to retire from their positions?  In other words, to ensure that 'education' is about the prevention and prohibition of education and training and skills development so as to ensure the people currently on payroll are, and will remain to be, the only game in town?  That seems to be the aspirational goal or ideal of it.  To not educate or train or develop any kind of a work-force, at all.  Why would we graduate them -- then we would have to pay them?  Why would we pay them when we can collect their slave-work for free?</p>

                                <p>How much research output do the researchers on Univesrity payroll do every year?  Is it indistinguishable from the output of a computer programme?  Is it indistinguishable from them copying and pasting together the output of their first year class or the output of their graduate research students whose work they stole before they bullied them into fleeing the 'University' with no credit for the work they have done?</p>

                                <p>New Zealand says there is no point graduating students from our 'Universities' becuase we aren't going to pay them to do the work that they have trained for.  Teachers.  Nurses.  Doctors.  All the things, really.  We will cry cry cry cry cry cry cry about how there aren't any and refuse to acknowledge that the problem is that we refuse to pay them.  The people presently on payroll will have to die before there will be a job for anybody else, apparently.  They are the only game in town.  Don't acknowledge anybody else's qualifications.</p>

                                <p>How many psychiatrists did Dr Leeks train to do the kinds or sorts of things that he was up to?  How many applications to Medicine did he throw away to ensure he would remain the only game in town?  How many studnets did he refuse to sign off on?  Just keep working the internships.  Just one more internships.  Just keep handing over more and more and more research 'work' to  your supervisor.  We still aren't done assessing whether you have the capacity to do the job.  We only know that the people presently on payroll are the only game in town and there will be a job for you over their dead bodies, apparently.  Have to bring people in from overseas because there aren't any skilled and trained New Zealanders.  None acknowledged as such that aren't indisginguishable from a computer programme therefore why pay them when you can get a computer programme to do their work for no pay?</p>

                                <p>'There could be no evidence admitted that would attest to corruption within the New Zealand Government'.  That's a good output for the courts.  They can refuse to accept evidence, refuse to accept filings. It's at the Judges's discretion to order re-filing of the re-filing of the re-filing of the re-filings, apparently or allegedly.  And the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Courts say that it is contrary to the independence of the Judiciary for them to remind the Judiciary on expectations for timely judgment delivery.  That is or means to say, remind them that 5 months post-hearing a Judgement is awaited...  Still..  Everything is held up by the courts.  Apparently they are off sick and they are off on holiday.  Becuase they are the only game in town for their payroll and that, presumably, is precisely why they are paid.  Chris Whelan hasn't processed a single application of wrongdoing against any of the 'Universities' of NZ since he was appointed to CE of the NZVCC back in about 2014.  The Education and Training Act says the position is about upholding the quality and integrity of NZ Universities.  Only, there isn't any quality and integrity to NZ Universities, at all, by the seems of it.  They (regularly, reliably, systemically and systematically) say that 'personal problems' occur such that they refuse to process enrolment, completions etc.  They won't get students work out for external examination and they choose to employ people with little to no research output.  They aren't even trying to be fair at all.  The problem, then, is that the likes of Justice Toogood need to be pulled out of retirement and re-appointed as Judge presumably because there isn't anybody else who will be acknowledged willing or able to do that job until he's dead.  Over his dead body.  Re-appointing a retired Judge is not a proper process for appointing a Judge.  They are not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                                <p>New Zealand does not have a functioning health,  education and training, judiciary, at all.  It is written into the Australian Constitution that NZ is a state of the Federation of Australia.  There is a process involved in how they are to go about changing their constitution.  That involves a vote.  They don't get to say that various of NZ leaders simply failed to turn up to various meetings therefore NZ is no longer a State of Australia by consent.  They never gave the people voting papers and asked them if they wanted to be citizens of Australia or not.  What does it mean to be a citizen of Australia?  Australaian wages for government work.  Access to Australian education and training programmes.  Government employment.  They aren't even trying to be fair.  NZ says they will not sign off on NZ qualifications because qualified people will flee from NZ to Australia for wages since they won't pay them to do skilled work in NZ.  They are trafficking slaves around is all they are doing.  They are not even trying to be fair.</p>

                                <p>Who wins?  Foreign countries, I guess.  Who ensure that Australasia needs to keep turning to them for skilled anything since Australasia failed to develop education and training programmes etc.  The only leaders International Community will acknowledge or accept for this region are ones who ensure the lack of education and training systems, judiciary, health system etc etc.  There doesn't appear to actually be anything here, at all.  Not even trying to be fair.  Refusign to process filings.  Refusing to process applications to enrol.  Refusing to process qualification completions.  Refusing to employ skilled workers.  Refusing to pay the workers.  Insisting on re-appointing 'Judges' from retirement to see nothing wrong.  Insisting on employing Chris Whelan who cannot / won't do the job for which he is paid.  There is nothing here, at all.</p>

                                <p>And of course the jobs (insfoar as there are any) go to the people they were always going to go to.  The dependents.  Those kept dependent.  Those not willing or able to function or work independently.  That's the aim or the goal or the purpose or the point of the education and training system.  Right?  To output indistinguishable units so they can console themselves that it's entirely arbitrary who is picked for payroll and who is picked to slave since they are all much of a much of a much of a samey sameness.  It wasn't like Dr Leeks  or Dr Green (Pathology, from the Cartwright Inquiry) was doing anything any differently from what anybody and everybody else who was acknowledged as Pathologist or Psychiatrist would be doing.  Right?  The only game in town.  Let's have yet another courtcase where the victims can cry cry cry cry cry about how impactful the perpetrators were.  How they will never ever be forgotten.  If you can't be loved may as well be hated, right?  Let's sing a monument to these monumental figures and create a real motivation and incentivisation for people to become Medical Doctors in these lands.  The courts can give teeth to how bringing these issues before the courts will result in the victims paying the victims paying the victims paying the victims paying the victims paying to sing sing sing about just how monumental these figures were.  How these only game in town figures ruined so very very very very very many lives.  In a land that aspires to be sooooooooooo competitive.  All the money from the victims so they can pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the courts.  What judiciary?  There is nothing here.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  THey aren't processing applciations to Medicine.  They aren't processing completions from training.  They are intentionally not doing these things so that they can dedeploy the likes of Dr Leeks around in order specifically to see how many lives can be declared 'incapacitated' and 'disabled' and the like.  How many lives they can claim to have ruined.</p>

                                <p>War on the people.  Think how how the politicians and various leaders think of the function of role of education.  Knowledge is power, apparently.  Why would those in power voluntarily choose to share power?  Why would they want to pursue equality or fairness?  Psychopaths.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>I think the messaging has been, for quite some time, that NZ aspires to be the garbage slave-land of the world.  It wants to seek out (sends the likes of Chris Whelan blackbirding) for people who have no options or no alternatives or who can be indoctrinated into believing that that is true.  Then they can pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for visa and visa and visa and visa and pay and pay and pay and pay for re-enrolment and re-enrolment and re-enrolment and re-enrolment.  Until it's time to take all their work for no credit and no pay and deport them.  Make them go away.  Quite the way to run an economy of slave 'workers', hey.  Not trying to have any kind of honesty or integrity at all -- right Chris Whelan?  The Judge says that it would be unlawful for you to perform your statutory function.  Riiiiight.  In upside down and back to front land.</p>

                                <p>Why do the Universities choose to hire senior partners of major firms to defend them in court?  That is the kind of thing that guilty people do.  Or maybe I'm a real prodigy with my filings that they didn't feel able to simply ignore my filings (it was civil proceedings and they needn't have hired legal counsel at all if they thought I was being vexatious).  But it turns out they could simply have relied upon the corruption of judges else the fact that NZ does not have a functioning judiciary, at all.  The judges refuse to accept evidence that I supplied.  They judges refuse to acknowledge half the laws (the ones conferring duties or obligations on the Universities).  The judges insist upon recasting or conceptualising or framing the problem that I brought before the courts as something other than the 'ultra vires' claim that I actually brought  before the courts.  They insistently refuse to distinguish between the outcome of a judgement (and whether I personally do or do not like it becuase it's all very very very very very personal and particular against me and not a matter of public interest at all, apparently) and the process by which the judgment is made.  The problem in NZ is that either there is not procedure for fair process else the procedure that there is is not followed.  For example, they will not allow blind grading of academic work on the basis of it's academic merits.  Because they want the children of the administration (for example) to be given the qualifications or the paycheques or whatever.  They aren't even trying to be fair at all.  So much work goes into ensuring that the likes of Dr Leeks is the only game in town.  Nobody else gets to have their application considered.  They throw the applications away before they consider them on their academic merits.  They intentionally enrol 18 year olds (saying they have discretion therefore are allowed) and say that they aren't so very much worse than any other applicant.  But they only say that  because they threw away the applications from any applicant that looked  better on paper.  They throw away applications from domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years (who are eligible to be enrolled in the programme they have applied to) to expediate enrolment of 18 year olds who will better  be trained to be the next Dr Leeks and Dr Green and so on.  They aren't even trying to be fair.  It isn't a tertiary education institution at all.  It's yet another government institution of abuse is what it is.  1/3rd the Medical Cohort of Otago were refused graduation on grounds that Harlene Hayes (subsequently redeployed to Western Australia) refused to accept they had completed the internships the Uni sent them to even when they had their internships signed off by supervisors.  So they were told, then, that they could only go into 'Junior Doctor' positions in NZ hospitals if they agreed to keep paying the university for re-enrolment just keep paying the university just keep paying the university.  Just keep doing the 'work' while you pay the university just keep handing over everything to the 'university'.  Not even trying to be a 'university'.  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camp land.  Nasty nasty nation of slavers.  </p>

                                <p>They brought the euthanasia drugs in.  Apparently we have a 'science led' health system.  Who does the LD 50 on the euthanasia drugs, then?  It doesn't matter what any of the laws are when the Judiciary fails to uphold them.  There's nothing here.  I don't see how anybody can do business in this jurisdication because the courts fail to function.  Won't enrol people in law school.  Won't graduate them.  Won't pay lawyers to work that job.  Etc.  There's nothing here.  Not even trying to be fair.  Nasty nasty psychopaths.</p>

                                <p>  https://www.newsroom.co.nz/secret-manuals-shroud-justice-in-secrecy  Not even trying, indeed.  My guess would be that the Judiciary knows full well that the bench books are in such bad shape that it's a f*cking embarrassment.  That's why they don't want the information to be made public.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Therefore secrecy.  Not even an OIA request for information will have the government hand over the shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame inducing documents.  The shame shame shame state of things.  So we'll all be held victims and hostages to their shame, then.  No work can be done on making anything any better.  Because:  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.</p>
