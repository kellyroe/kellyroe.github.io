 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>Alright, so here's the story.  I am waiting on two things: </p> 

                                <p>(1)  The Australian National University.  They are locating my student records and saying something about why I left the ANU without recieving credit for a PhD. 
                                </p> 

                                <p>(2)  The social security tribunal of New Zealand.  The courts have set more than $20,000 security for costs otherwise my proceedings are, they say, forced to have been abandoned.  Forced to be aborted, if you will.  The registrar's say that my cases are not public interest cases and everything is all very particular or personal against me.
                                </p>


                            <p>
                            The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications.  They define a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  
                            <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a> Whereas the High Court Judge thought that the University of Waikato was entitled to refuse to get my work to external examiners because I submitted it 'too early'.  Waikato said I needed to work for 12 months (at least) before submitting a 120 point thesis for up to 3 months of external examination.  Apparently that's normal practice for all the students -- but it's not a matter of public interest, it's all very personal against me.
                            </p>

                            <p>Here is how much the Inland Revenue says I owe the New Zealand Government for my 'Education' and 'Training' that are no longer acknowledged because New Zealand qualifications expire 5 years post-graduation (well, not the Judges law degrees, apparently, but my qualifications have expired): 
  
                            <a href="judicial-review/ird-shot.pdf" target="_self"> $104,663.</a>

                            They have not provided a break-down of what courses they recorded me as having been enrolled in, in what year.  I have transcripts for some years that I will upload.  They acknowledge that I have completed BA(hons) and an MA (I can't tell whether they invoiced 1 year or 2 years or more of fees total for the MA - it looks to me from my transcript that they may have double-billed).  They refuse to acknowledge that I have completed anything since then.  They keep invoicing my student loan -- for courses that I never applied to be enrolled in (changing enrolment dates for more billings for them which make me look like I'm slow).  They take my research work, particularly, and give it to third parties without crediting me (or paying me).   
                            </p>

                            <p> We don't have a health system.  We don't have an education and training system.  There's nothing here.  It's a detention camp is all.  There's nothing here.  The courts don't / won't / can't function.  There's nothing here.  Or there's two worlds or two realms, or something, and I'm shut out.  Not Miss popular.  No PhD for me.  That's clearly what it's about.  Honorary because we like you else nothing at all.
                            </p>

                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  They aren't progressing the filings. They are refusing to supply applications, refusing to process applications on their academic merits.  Apparently it isn't a matter of public interest how they pick and choose people to pass themsleves off as 'doctors' in our hospitals.
                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  Demanding me to pay more and more and more money to the courts else they force all my cases aborted, or abandoned.  
                                </p> 

                            <p>
                            It seems to me that the Australian Constition explicitly states that New Zealand is regarded, by them, to be a State of the Federation of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  Australia refuses to honor it's own Constitution.  New Zealand seems to function as a detention camp of Australia only.  That is how the NZ Government chooses to keep the people of New Zealand.
                            </p>

                            <p>Here are  <a href="judicial-review/sup-court-waikato.pdf" target="_self"> My Filings </a>to the Supreme Court regarding the University of Waikato    
                            </p>

                            <p>The Social Security Appeal Authority  <a href="judicial-review/ssaa.pdf" target="_self"> Intention to schedule a phone call sometime after July 4. </a></p>

                            <p>So the state of the scam is 1/3rd of the nurses aren't graduated because they refuse to sign off that they have completed their internship.  They are 'working' 40 hour weeks while paying the University for their student fees, not being paid by the hospital.  They get them to re-enrol and re-enrol and re-enrol and keep paying keep paying never stop paying the University.  That is how we 'staff' the hospital.  With unpaid slaves.  Who pay the University.  How long can they get away with that?  I guess at some point someone will blow up the hospital.  That seems to be what they are going for, here.  Quite the experiment.  Quite the primate research study.  They say they won't give them their qualifications -- because then they would choose to leave for overseas (Australia, say) where they would actually be paid to work.  They don't want them leaving, and they don't want to pay them, so they decide they are entitled to keep them, slaving, as slaves.  If they don't like it, well, f*ck off and die, then.  Can always replace you with a new cohort of students.  It's sooooooooo competitive.  The students will do anything anything anything for their degree.  And it's all very normal completely normal and standard and it just happens to everyone like this.  It's just the way that it is.  because of COvid.  You know...
                            </p>

                            <p>Shortland Street teaches people how to act, in the Hospitals.  That's why we have the Bloomfield show.  Public Health Education.  It isn't like Pharmac purchases first world medications, anyway.  People airlift to Sydney.  There's nothing in this little detention camp.  It's not even trying to develop.  It's just a stupid scam.  They pay slavers to keep slaves.  They don't pay the workers.  There's spin doctors and marketers and managers and administrators and slavers, generally.  And then there's just this scam.  Hopefully they will die before graduation (else we simply won't graduate them) and if they push it..  Well, they must  be a violent criminal.  Right?  I mean, they must  be.  They don't count.  We refuse to count them.  Apparently our unemployment rate is so low.  So low.  HOw many people are there, do you think?  Count the other way.  HOw many full time jobs are there?  Enough for 1 in every...  10 people?  People don't count -- because you are invoicing them as students right.  So they arent' unemployed.  Else they are disabled.  That's 25 per cent who don't count as unemployed.  Too old.  Too young.  Criminals.  
                            </p>

                            <p>How long can it possibly take to complete 1 year of research?  I gu gu gu gu gu gu gu guess you'll just be forced to re re re re re re repeat the year.  That's a gu gu gu gu gu gu gud plan for you.  Hey, thanks.  Thanks for all your help.  What's that?  Waiting for you to di di di di di di die before there will be any job at all for me.  Well that's great, now.  So much better than a plan whereby you help me.  Then maybe one day I'll be in the position to help you.  But no, you chose to bet against me.  I wrote for you as an undergrad.  You set the topic and off I went and wrote what you wanted me to write about.  Then you can use that and incorporate it into your own research, or whatever.  Then I pick a topic (personal identity) and you don't encourage me to get my work to journals (not even help me enough with it to co-author and get it out in a timely fashion).  Years later you send your own stuff off to publishers, you inform me.  Of course, your job isn't to help me get publications.  Or for us to get publications.  Your job it so stockpile my work until it's abandonware and then you can pass it off as your own.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I did not know that many people consider the game to be to race your way to doctor (of any variety) by the time you are 25 years old.  18 from School, 21 from undergrad, 22 for Honors, 25 brings us to the end of a 3 year PhD.  Then there's 1 year of sucking up -- right?  After being told you have to work for 3 years before submitting for examination then there's 3 months examination, 6 months re-enrolment (the inevitable outcome of what they like to call 'first examination'), another 3 months examination.  And then..  Probably up to 10 weeks of crying screaming tortuous tantrums while the University administration and the supervisor bring out the sniper rifles...  And maybe (if you are popular enough and you sucked enough of the right d*cks) then you'll get your PhD.  Or your MBChB.  After working for..  Is it a 1 year internship in the hospitals (yeah, right).  While you pay fees to the University, of course.  Never stop.  Never stop.  Never stop within invoicing your workers to do the work.  Never stop keeping the slaves.  Quite the racket.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            So, It's a big f*cking joke that I might get to do Medicine.  Good grief.  You didn't make it through your PhD by the time you were about 26.  You failed.  Hahahahhaha. You were too stupid to realise that they weren't teachign you anyting.  Their job, as they saw it, was to eliminate you, and do everything they could to prevent and prohibit your timely completion so they could steal your abandonware for their own.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            So.  I'm a violent criminal.  Clearly.  I'm a psychopath.  Sure.  I'm a danger to others and myself.  Yeah right.  All these reasons why I don't count.  My Degrees are not acknowledged.  My applications are not progressed.  They have chosen what is right for me in life.  Sterelny wrote his slavery manifesto 'the evolved apprentice' so whether I want to do whatever..  Is irrelevant.  I can be forced to slave for a sequel.  Contribute to  his slavery manifesto.  Whether I want to, or not.  That's what Australia chose to invest in (what they chose to fund) when it came to Philsophy in Australia.  And how they were going to treat the New Zealand studnets, in particular.  I mean, the NZ governmetn refuses to allow development.  Prefers to keep slaves.  Hold hostages.  Highest rate of unlawful involuntary detention in the world (before Covid but of course also during Covid and also of course after Covid).  Won't get with the developmetn agenda.  Just won't do it.
                             </p>
