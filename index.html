                            <article>

                            <p>
                            The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications.  They define a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a> 
                            </p>

                           <p>Australasian Universities believe they are entitled to simply refuse to process or progress students work, however.  Take it to court, they say.  Then the courts refuse to progress filings.   
                            </p>

                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  They aren't progressing the filings.
                            </p>


                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  
                                </p> 

                            <p>
                            It seems to me that the Australian Constition explicitly states that New Zealand is regarded, by them, to be a State of the Federation of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  But Australia unlawfully detains New Zealanders and deports them to New Zealand.  I guess they don't treat New Zealanders any worse than the New Zealand Government treats New Zealanders is the point there.  Quite the detention camp of the world.  Just keep giving us work and paying us money while we keep recording increasing levels of debt against your name.  The bonded servitude slave camps of New Zealand.  Apparently we are short of Medical Doctors.  It is harder to find or breed the next Dr Leeks than you might suppose.  It's soooooooo competitive.  There is no sense of 'helping professions'.  Helping me helping me helping me help myself to you.  I did the time.  Where is my Degree?
