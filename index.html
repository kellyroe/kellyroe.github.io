                            Other graduates of the Australian National  University PhD programme might like to show everybody the written comments they received from external examiners before they underwent an oral defence of their doctoral thesis.  For the purposes of establishing that they understood it, thereore might possibly be the author of it, if not for any other reason.  They were supposed to be working independently on their research at an institution whose primary function is research.  Only, they didn't seem to be at all interested in getting any students work out for external examination, in a timely fashion or otherwise, so far as I could see.

                            </p>

                            <p>Is Kim Sterelny still on payroll?  Oh, my.  I'm trying to remember how many years ago it was that people celebrated his 60th.  Only 5 more years to go then it's retirement,  hey.  No more payroll for him.  Time to give someone else a turn.  Yeah, right.  Only over his dead body, apparently.  That's what 'old money' means, now.  All the money for the over 65's on payroll while the next generation all marched off to the prison slave detention camp facilities.  Best be re re re re re enrolled and pay and pay and pay for visa re re re re re processing.  Various over 65's don't feel like retiring any time soon.  Thanks for your generosity giving up your life so that they could have everything they  believe their are entitled to.  Them having all the titles, of course.  Them and their dependents.  Kept dependent.  Are they dead yet?  At least they get the aged care workers they chose to re re re re enroll in their healthcare assistant qualifications, I suppose.  They can do their internship while paying and paying and paying the university and paying and paying and paying for visa re re re re processing so they can do a little anyting anything anything to the over 65's who won't give up their payroll in order to keep their whole harem of dependents.  Are they dead yet?  Oh please God, hurry up.</p>
