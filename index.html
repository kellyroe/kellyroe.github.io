                            <p> <a href="writing/LAW 121B.pdf" target="_self">Law exam.</a>  </p>

                            <p>I wish I kept copies of the Population / Public Health essays that I wrote that were awarded 30 per cent only (I was failed for the entire course).  I personally don't think that they were appreciably worse than anything else I had done...  And I don't think that is coming from a position of bias.</p>

                            <p>Why did they fail me?  Because...  I didn't realise before-hand but the Population / Public Health pathway was a Maaori Pathway.  They had the people picked out who they wanted to do Medicine from that Pathway and they did not pick me.  Since I was passing Organic Chemistry etc they thought that the only way they could stop me taking what they believed they were entitled to was by failing me for the course -- so they could say that since I failed the course I was 'ineligible' to have applied.</p>

                            <p>At the end of the semester I dropped papers from the second semsester so I would end up with less than 120 points in that academic year.  That way I preserve my full time GPA.  That is how they define what full time and part time mean.  Your best 120 points per academic year.  If you haven't done 120 points then you don't have a full time GPA.  They think I am cheating that that is how they defined full time GPA and that was why I dropped back to part time.  But that was what they tried to do to me.  Ruin my GPA.  By failing me for Population / Public Health.  They forced me to flee the 'University'.  That is what University grades mean, according to them. They are discretionary things with no meaning.  Used to bully people around.  Arbitrary.  Not academic.  What University?  </p>

                            <p>How many other studnets are bullied into fleeing so that certain others are the only game in town?  The 'Universities' want to say people are leaving because of Covid.  But that doesn't seem plausible.  People (with capacity) are leaving because they are being bullied away.  Then the 'Universities' feel justified in simply not graduating the remainder.  They do the ethics tests and they enrol only those without ethics so they don't have to feel bad refusing to graduate them.  Why?  So the skilled labor jobs can be filled by Americans, I suppose.</p>

                            <p>In other words..  I suppose the only reason why I got first in class for the law exam was because I was enrolled in it as a general education paper (rather than as part of first year law) and they wanted to claim me.  They thought that I should pay and pay and pay and pay the 'University' so that they could...  Eventually...  Refuse to give me a law degree.  Else refuse to register me as a lawyer.  Else refuse to pay me as a lawyer.  You know how it goes.  You pay and you pay and you pay and you pay the 'University' until it is time for you to go away.  Because of all the 65 +++ year olds on payroll, still, and all the Americans who they see fit to give the NZ jobs to because there aren't any people here willing or able to be on payroll to do skilled jobs.</p>

                            <p>For example.  Brett Calcott married an American.  She was given employment by the University of Auckland so that she is paid to teach and research in Philosophy of Biology.  Why didn't they hire Brett (the NZ citizen) to work that job?  Or why didn't they hire Ben (the NZ citizen) to work that job?  Or why didn't they hire John Matthewson (the NZ citizen) to work that job?  Why did they choose to hire an American?  I thought we were only supposed to hire foreigners when there isn't anyone from NZ willing or able to work the job.  What was wrong with the NZers?  I'm pretty sure that any of them would have really really really wanted that job.  It would have given Brett financial independence...  Though, I don't know about Brett...  Is the idea that everybody sends their work to Kim Sterelny in his capacity as editor of the Philosophy of Biology journal..  Then he can delay publication until the people not already on payroll give up and go away or die or whatever.  Then he can reattribute authorship to people already on payroll. Or maybe reattribute authorship to the people he likes to party with, or something.  I mean to say, maybe Brett doesn't really have Phlosophy output.  Maybe he just does webpage stuff so that they can take take take the research outputs of some and reattribute them then to people who don't have the willingness or ability or whatever to have research output to record research output against their name.  I don't know.  It's soooo competitive, apparently.  Soooo competitive I should be run out of town!!</p>

                            <p>I suppose that now what happens is that Penn takes over the Philosophy of Biology Journal.  A former graduate of Penn gets employed by the University of Auckland.  The University of Auckland studnets work gets piped directly to Penn by way of Brett's wife ensuring that it all gets uploaded to Turnitin.  That's a great idea.  The USA can just take all the creative outputs and all the intellectual properly of the NZers.  Hand it to the particularly dim-witted Americans to pass off as their own.  Ingenious.</p>

                            <p>So, the 'University' of Auckland tells me that if I'm not going to apply on the basis of Health Science First Year (which I couldn't do since they said I failed the population health paper) I'd need to do an entire new qualification, instead.  I'm clearly not going to re-enrol in anything to do with Public Health.  Flee from Tamaki campus.  That's for sure.  Not a University, hey.  Not even trying to be.</p>

                            <p>So I apply to a 120 point 1 EFT MPhil with the University of Waikato.  I apply by the application deadline.  I get an auto response from the University acknowledging that they have received my application.  It is the day before the stated deadline by which applications must be received.  They then proceed to alter the time stamp and accuse me of being late.  They refuse to enrol me in the programme I applied to, by the application deadline.  Instead they offer me enrolment in a programme that I never applied to (with different enrolment dates).  What is the problem,  here?  How many other people applied to do a 120 point 1 EFT MPhil with the University of Waikatko in 2018?  I bet (I don't know, but I bet) the answer to that is:  0.  I bet...  That I was the ONLY person to have applied to that programme of study.  So, why won't they enrol me in the programme of study to which I had applied?  Are they afraid that I will fail?  They decided they were going to fail me before they even enrolled me.  What University?  There isn't anything there, at all. </p>

                            <p>Where is the research output of the people on payroll to do research?  Where is it?</p>

                            <p>The Australian National University kept Carl Brusse enrolled for more than 10 years.  Refusing to send the work that he had done out for external examination.  Getting more and more money from the government for keeping him enrolled.  Takign more and more work from him.</p>

                            <p>Nick Southwood said that the external examiners of his thesis did not request him to make a single change.  That seems suspicious to me.  Did he really get reports from external examiners?  I would have thought they would have thought that in order for them to be seen to be doing their job properly they would have suggested at least one change so they could feel that they added value by being external examiners.  I don't remember hearing anybody at the ANU defend their thesis to external examiners.  I don't think a single thesis defence was scheduled.  THey aren't allowing anybody to have their work externally examined by someone independent.  What education and training system?  There isn't anyting there.  It is sooooo competitive that there's simply nothing there, at all.</p>

                            <p>All these people over the age of 65 on payroll.  People who have had government payroll for more than 40  years.  They won't get out.  They want to say that nobody else could do what they do so we are forced to put up with their psychopathic selves.  However many generations need to die for their psychopathic selves. </p>

                            <p>They deserve the aged care systems etc that they invested in.  THey thought they were for other people.  But they should be the first to be signed up for the death camps that they made.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>
