                            <p>Australiasia does not have an education and training system.  I'm not sure whether England or the USA has an education and training system, or not.  I guess it is better developed with curriculum contents.  Pathoma's Pathology.  First Aid for the USMLE.  Curriculum contents.  So you can take a look through the curriculum contents of what you will be learning if you enrol in that programme of study.  That was supposed to be the idea, anyway. </p>

                            <p>Where is the curriculum contents for Australasia?  What textbooks do they assign, then, in their University Academic Courses?  What was the reading age supposed to be, for their students?  Big Robbins..  Rather than Pathoma...  Big Robbins was accompanied by a multiple-choice book, though, right?  So the examination assessment questions were picked out from the accompanying test book.  No?  So you have a lot of questions to learn the answers and commentray.  That's the knowledge-base.  Hey, you could just make up your own questions -- maybe ones with no right answer.  Overwhelm with small unrelated details to prevent understanding or building up of an overall picture...  What education and training system?  Last's Anatomy?  Really?  So that we can listen to the surgeons talk through their descriptive anatomy while they are doing procedures and operations?  Know their anatomy from Last's, do they?  They start with the surgical safety check-list (from pilot safety) -- right?  (1)  Let's start by introducing ourself.  Our name.  Our registration number.  Our role in the operation today.  We know who is responsible for the tray.  We know who is responsible for declaring closing only once all items that are supposed to be on the tray have been returned to the tray.  Nononononononono.  That is not how we do in Australasia.  What education and training system? </p>

                            <p>They are advertising, now, for 'not training positions' in the hospitals.  They want people to do their surgeries and they will call them 'Registrars' but they won't say that they are formally accepted into their training programme -- because they don't have one.  There isn't anything there.  Nobody will teach them anything.  They won't pay people to teach the next generation.  THey will only pay people to bully and abuse and not do the job for which they are paid.  </p>

                            <p>Who would teach the next generation?  I think you have a bunch of 65+++ year old guys who have no intention of retiring.  They'll die  before they'll retire.  THey won't voluntarily stand down.  THey won't voluntarily walk away from the money.  They certainly won't voluntarily walk away from the power.  How do they choose who their supposed 'apprentices' are?  By photos?  And their apprentices are required to do anything anything anything anything else they can say their apprentices are crazy psychopathic rubbish rubbish rubbish.  That the basic ideology?  How many decades was Carl Brusse an apprentice of the Philosophy Programme of the Australian National Univesrity?  Research School of Social Science?  For how many years?  The people on payroll to work in the Research School HAD NO TEACHING. They did not teach classes.  THe only thing they had to do was output research of their own and supervise their graduate research students.  Why didn't they get Carl's work output to external examiners after he'd been enrolled for 2 years to allow up to 1 year of external examination process?  Why didn't they get ANY of their studnets work output to external examiners?  Nobody had an externally examined oral defence, for example.  Nobody.  Various people said the University told them that their work had been accepted without any changes required.  I don't think it plausible that external and independent examiners didn't find so much as a single typographical error.  Not so much as a single extra reference to be added (maybe to their work).  I don't find that very plausible at all.  I wonder, actually, how  many of them actually wrote their own work, at all.  How many of them were given others work output to pass off as their own.  </p>

                            <p>Go to 'University' to eat your lunch?  Have morning and afternoon tea?  Dinner?  Drinks?  Go away on camping trips?  Live in your supervisors house?  Housesit for him while he goes off on family holidays...  IT TAKES THE WORK -- AND IT GETS IT TO THE EXTERNAL EXAMINER ffs.  IT HAD ONE JOB TO DO.  I mean, he could have helped me with my research.  He was paid to do that...  And what meetings did we have about my research, then?  When did you ask to see my research?  When did you supply me with comments on my research?  When did you supply me with readings or instructions?  If you aren't going to do your job then the least you can do is get out of the f*cking way.  How old are you?  Is Frank Jackson still on payroll?  He still supervising students, is he?  What education and training programme?  Taken over by psychopaths.  There's nothing there.</p>

                            <p>That was Sterelny's point, of course.  Australasia does not have an education and training programme.  It has been taken over by psychopaths.  THey will need to die before there will be employment in the field for various other people.  Think the issue with Sterelny was that academia is a farce.  A joke.  I mean to say, what happens with the Journals is that they get submissions from people and they don't engage in blind peer review at all.  Rather, they look into who the stated author is and delay and rubbish rubbish rubbish the output of anyone not already on payroll  -- if they even acknowledge receipt of the submission at all.  THen, once they've bullied the author out of the field entirely they re-attribute authorship to someone else and try and conceal that behind a paywall.  Was Sterelny the author of even half of what he claims as his own publications?  Unlikely.  Try and have a yakkity yak yak to him about his own publications.  He won't.  He can't?  What a scummy scam. </p>

                            <p>There isn't a health system in Australasia because they don't have informed consent.  Can't do it / won't do it.  No conception of it.  Simply don't care.  THey don't think that people have the right not to be subjected to medical experimentation.  Animals.  They treat the population like animals.  Not behaviorally modern, eh, Sterelny.  Or, as you would say:  'F*cked the dog, mate, you f*cking c*nt'.  That's right, he's not behaviorally modern, at all.  What education and training system?  Will not pay people to work that job.  There's nothing there.</p>
