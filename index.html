                                <p>These webpages document corruption, in New Zealand, because things are so corrupt in New Zealand and Australia that there really isn't anything else to be done.
                                </p>

                                <p>They are not processing applications to enrol, applications for employment, or, most likely, applications for things like permits or visas etc properly.  It is all, apparently at the discretion of various people to make decisions on highly personal and idiosyncratic grounds and they are not accountable at all for any of the decisions that they make.  
                                </p>

                                <p>You are expected to spend you time investing in all these extra-curricular activities.  House-sit for your supervisor and party party party party party lets go to lunch, dinner, drinks, let's go camping!  Let's go travelling around the world on 'conference' and have sleep-overs all around the world.  Party party party let's have a party.  
                                </p>

                                <p>I have documented on the writing page academic research work that I have done while enrolled at the University of Waikato and the Australian National University.  They refuse to acknowledge much of the work that I have done.  THey refuse to provide supervision to their research students.  The University gets money from the government for keeping the student enrolled and the University refuses to employ people willing and or able to supervise research.  Where is the evidence of supervision of my research?  Where is the evidnece of supervision meetings?  Where is the evidence of concrete comments on my work?  Where is the evidence of the supervisor telling me of things like what I needed to get to them by what date in order for them to do these things?  I supplied my supervisor with research and they don't comment on it until they start throwing screaming tantrum of hissy fits that the work is not going out to externals.  They will just keep writing that I should have more and more and more and more reenrollment and reenrollment and reenrollment and reenrollment so they can collect up more and more and more and more and more money for keeping me enrolled while they refuse to acknowledge my work. 
                                </p>

                                <p>I guess I was supposed to follow them around and beg them or bribe them?  How is it supposed to go, exactly?  THey are on payroll to supervise me.  
                                </p>

                                <p>The Australian National University got a writing sample from me that was supposedly good enough for them to have me as a summer research scholar.  Professor Martin Davies refused to write me a reference towards any PhD applications but he said he would support my going back to the ANU to do a PhD there.  I gave the ANU two additional writing samples and they enrolled me in their PhD programme.  On the seminars page you can see evidence of my progressing in my academic work over 2006 and 2007.  There are powerpoint presentations and there are also, in some instances, the written talk that the powerpoint and seminar was based on.  The write-up of the talk, I mean to say.  That I presented at various conferences.  Where is the evidence of my supervisor having provided any supervisory input at all on the production of any of that research?  Where is the evidence of my supervisor having directed my readings, instructing any writings, having commented on any of the work?  Where is the evidence of supervision?  What the hell do they pay him for?
                                </p>

                                <p>My file notes record him saying that the ANU should get more and more and more and more and more money from the Australian Government to keep me enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled in the programme.  My file notes record him (and other academics in the department) saying that I nearly had a full draft and (at one point) they expected me to complete in a few months (on time).  Where is the evidence that they passed on this expectation and deadline to me so that I could ensure that I worked to it?  Where is the evidence of them doing any of the things that they were supposed to do in training me at all?
                                </p>

                                <p>Instead of doing his job training me Kim Sterelny wrote a slavery manifesto 'The Evolved Apprentice' where he writes about all the things that go into training while simultaneously refusing to supply any of those things to me.  He asked me to housesit for him several times, thought, and go away on various camping trips under the rubric of conference while refusing to do his job supervising me.  Still, the least he can do, then, is get out of the f*cking way -- right?  If he isn't going to do his job, then get out of the f*cking way. Get the work to the external examiners, then.  So the external examiners can examine the work on it's academic merits.  That is or means to say, that a person who doesn't know anything about me (doesn't know my age or my gender or how many years I've been working or who my daddy is etc etc) can examine my work on it's academic merits.  Can provide comments on things to be changed if things need to be changed.  Do the f*cking work that my supervisor refused to do, in other words.
                                </p>

                                <p>But he wouldn't even do that.
                                </p>

                                <p>Why the hell would I want to do Philosophy when it's  been overwridden by the psychopaths that he loves to write about?  There isn't any philosophy because it's been overtaken by psychopaths.  Instead of doing philosophy we get to housesit and socialise at lunch and dinner and drinks and go away diving on conferences and have conferences at fancy hotels.  Instead of doing the academic work and doing the work supervising the studnets various people are paid vast amounts of research funding to keep students enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and it's so fun to party party party party party what philosophy?  Nothing to see, people.  Nothing to see.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  Nothing at all.
                                </p>

                                <p>New Zealand constantly cry cry cry cry cry cry cry 'we don't have skilled workers'.  New Zealand won't pay anybody to train the next generation of workers.  New Zealand wont' pay anybody to get out of the f*cking way of the next generation of workers, either.  Get out of the f*cking way then, Sterelny.  Retire already.  F*cking die for all I care. What would you care if I died?  Not one jot.  Not one iota.  Why the hell would I care about you, then?  You can't even do your f*cking job.  The f*cking job for which you are paid.  Where is the evidence of your supervising me?  Where is the evidence of supervision?  If you can't do it then where is the evidence of you documenting how you are unwilling and or unable to do the job for which you are paid and recuse yourself from your position, then? Where is the evidence of your getting my work that I got you out to external examiners?  Get out of the f*cking way.
                                </p>

                                <p>New Zealand cry cry cry cry cry cry cry 'we don't have enough doctors.  We don't need more philosophy academics.  All of our Philosophy PhD graduates don't have jobs in New Zealand.  We will preferentially hire graduates of overseas Universities over New Zealanders.  We will not acknowledge our own PhD graduates.  But we have progressed and developed in our race to the bottom.  We won't get our students work out to external examiners so that they can't possibly sign off on our studnets having completed their research work now, either!  The lengths we will go to because we like to cry cry cry cry cry that we don't have any skilled workers'.
                                </p>

                                <p>The Statutory Law of New Zealand (Education and Training Act) states that domestic adults are eligible to be enrolled in programmes they have applied to.  The Universities have discretion to decide whether or not they believe teenagers can complete the programme and discretino to decide whether particular teenagers can complete the programme and discretion to enrol only the teenagers who they believe are able to complete the programme.  But they have no discretion at all to discuss amongst themselves and decide whether or not domestic adults are eligible.  They are required to regard domestic adults (who have attained the age of 20 years) to be eligible.  
                                </p>

                                <p>Despite this, the Universities of Auckland and Otago have seen fit to (1) say that in order for me to be eligible I was required to enroll in further study with a NZ University first (because they asserted they have the ability to disregard study completed more than 5 years ago).  (2) remove my application in early processing stages to prevent the application going before the selection committee with all the other applications.  (3) refuse to supply me with application to enrol.  In other words, the Universities of New Zealand think that they have unlimited power to pick and choose who they enrol in what programme.  They have used this unlimited power that they believe they have to fill up certain programmes (particularly Medicine and Law) with teenagers.  So they can have things like Law camp and take them camping.  Ski trips.  Then they belive they have discretion to say that they all failed to meet the requirements of the qualification (because we are keeping indentured servant or slave camps only) and therefore we refuse to graduate them.  I mean, you can hire yourself a gown and take photos.  You can photoshop in an approximation of a VC.  You can print yourself off whatever you like and hang it on the wall.  The transcripts aren't worth the paper they aren't even printed on, these days, and New Zealand (and by the seems of it Australian) Universities are not really functioning as Universities, at all.  I don't know what you need to do in order to get certain degrees?  They don't seem to be graduating.  I suppose it is so that they can get immigrants in working certain 'jobs' until they realise they aren't on payroll for working those jobs.  If they don't pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the University for re-enrolling (qualifications not acknowledged, anymore, visa taken back, go directly to prison or get out of our country).
                                </p>

                                <p>Dishonest people live here.  You cannot do business with New Zealand.
                                </p>

                                <p>The judiciary has, thus far, refused to uphold justice.  Justice Fitzgerald found (in Roe v University of Auckland) that the University did not in fact have the authority to decide eligibility criterion for domestic adults.  But she refused to supply teeth or consequences for them having misadvised me that I needed to do various other things (at considerable cost to myself) in order to get eligibilty.  She said that it did not matter whether I was eligible or not because they had authority to set selection criterion.  But in response to this the selection criterion that they set involved GPA, UMAT/UCAT, and interview score jointing determining a rank order score where places were to be offered to candidates on the  basis of their rank order scoring (with discretion to promote lower scored individuals on the basis of equity consideration for Maaori, Pacifica, disability, refugee only).  All I asked Auckland to do was enter my GPA, UMAT/UCAT, and interview score into their rank order scoring and offer me a place (or not) on the basis of my scoring.  I was not asking them to give me disability equity consideration.  I was asking them to progress the application according to their standard algorithm for selection.  In response to this the University had told me that they had done that and my rank order score was not high enough for a place.  I said I did not believe them.  They informed me of how they calculated my GPA.  They did not calculate it in accordance with their algorithm.  They took my WORST (rather than best) 120 points (by disregarding a summer school paper above stage 1) and they used a year in which I did not even complete 120 points instead of my last full time year (where my GPA was higher in years where I had higher workload).  The University said that it did not matter that they had miscalculated my GPA because I was not eligible.  But they don't get to decide eligibility.  The courts found that they do have discretion to set selection criterion when they get more applications than there are places.  But the courts failed to find that if they have set selection criterion that are in fact lawful, then they are required to actually use that selection criterion in order to select candidates.
                                </p>

                                <p>The evidnece is that the University of Auckland is corrupt as to how they are selecting studnets to enrol in MBChB.  They have had every opportunity to put right any honest errors on their part that they may have made in processing my application.  2 Deans and the Vice Chancellor were made aware of how they miscalculated my GPA and refused to offer me enrolment (or not) on the basis of my rank order score, for the reason that they said they did not have to do this because they believed they had discretion to regard any candidate who had not completed a qualification from a NZ university within the last 5 years to be 'ineligible'.  In conjunction with this information ask yourself -- who did get sent offers of enrolment in MBChB?  The answer to that is teenagers who were being selected at the end of their first year of university study around the same time as when the university was deciding on what grades they were going to give those same studnets for their first year study with that university.  They were fixing both their grades and whether or not they were being offered enrolment in MbChB at the same time, in other words.  The decisions were not made on the basis of GPA, the GPA decisions were made on the basis of who was going to be enrolled in MBChB.  The other main source of enrolments was students who were presently enrolled in a New Zealand University in their third year of a three year undergraduate Degree.  The grades those students were going to be given for their third year of study were being decided by their New Zealand Universities at around the same time as the University of Auckland was deciding who to enrol in MBChB.  That is or means to say the vast majority of the students who were offered enrolment in MBChB were not graduates of a New Zealand University, at all.  Students who were offered enrolment on the basis of their Honors Year were in similar position of their last year of full time study grades being decided at the same time as offers of enrolment in MBChB.  I mean to say the Universities are fairly obviously and clearly fixing (as in making up or doctoring) the grades.  New Zealand's shortage of doctors is doctored, in fact.  New Zealand refuses to enrol, progress, sign off on completion of training.  New Zealand also refuses to publically advertise positions, refuses to progress the applications for positions that have been advertised, refuses to pay the workers.  There's really nothing here.  Just a scummy scummy scam.                                </p>

                                <p>The University of Otago is not processing applications to enrol in MBChB properly.  They believe they have discretion to throw away applications from domestic adults in order to prioritise selection of teenagers.  They then arrange for teenagers to have internships where they are not allowed to go to the hospital and do the internship, or they refuse to acknowledge that they have been signed off as having completed it if it has been signed off.  They are refusing to graduate people who have met the requirements of the qualifications insofar as the requirements of the qualifications are actually possible to meet.  I mean to say, they make the requirements impossible for anybody to meet and they just hand out the acknowledgements to a  bunch of phoney frauds.  I guess that is the idea.  Having a PhD or a MBChB makes you a 'most desirable' person since they can throw you in prison or rescind your visa or whatever at any point in time (at the point in time when it is time for them to pay you, strangely enough, nobody would have seen that coming).

                                <p>Cry cry cry cry cry for skilled workers from overseas so that we can have them here, pretending to be working, until it's time for us to pay them and then it's time for them to go away.  There's nothing here.  No education and training system at all.  Thus far the courts of New Zealand have refused to uphold justice.  I suppose that is because the 'lawyers' needed to graduate from Law Degrees and why would we think that Law Degrees have any more quality and integrity than philosophy degrees have any more quality and integrity than medical degrees.  There's actually nothing to see, people.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  What a hokey scummy scam.  Don't get sick, y'all.  It's sooooooooo competitive.  How many people can you kill today?  That's the idea/l -- right?  What you have to do to get a reference, these days.  Oh, my.
                                </p>

                            <p>The Tertiary Education Commission defines a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  
                            <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a>.  The Universities and the Courts will not accept this, however.  They will not allow people to complete their work in a timely fashion.  They force extensions.  Sometimes studnets are outright bullied into not handing their work in.  Sometimes they pretend they never received work that was in fact handed in.  If you keep records of the fact that you handed the work in before the deadline then the University and the Courts both still deny it.  They will not allow people to complete their work in a timely fashion.  Because it is not an education system.  It is an unlawful slave or detention camp for endentured servants.
                            </p>

                            <p>The Judiciary is now imploding.  Making it obvious or apparent to everyone that there isn't a functioning Judiciary, etiher.  Read the Judgements of the Supreme Court.  Were you floored by the Judicial Reasoning as I was?  Were you motivated and inspired to learn from the Supreme Court of New Zealand what Justice looks like?  The embodiment of Justice, right there.  It is not a matter of public interest that New Zealand Universities are not processing applications to enrol, progressions through training, and qualification completions fairly (on the basis of the academic merits).  It is not a matter of public interest, apparently.  I exhausted a 3 stage internal complaints resolution with the Universities. I took it to the Ombudsman and I took it to the VC of the New Zealand Tertiary Education Commission (who likes to market at Universities New Zealand who likes to have a con-munications page 'n' iconography kinda like 'Nature') who has the statutory responsibility to uphold the quality and integrity of New Zealand University Qualifications.  And when these individuals chose to use their position to produce garbage output on how they can't see anything wrong with the Universities refusing to follow the law and also refusing to follow their own regulations the Supreme Court of New Zealand thinks that that is fine and in fact I should pay a bunch of court costs to the New Zealand Courts for the crimes (effectively) of the Universities of New Zealand.  
                            </p>

                            <p>That is to say New Zealand does not appear to have a functioning Judiciary.  
                            </p>

                            <p>Do not travel to New Zealand, there is nothing here.
                            </p>


                            <p>Here is how much the Inland Revenue now says I owe the New Zealand Government for my 'Education' and 'Training' that are not acknowledged because New Zealand qualifications apparently expire 5 years post-graduation (well, not the Judges law degrees, apparently, but my qualifications have expired): 
                            <a href="judicial-review/ird-shot.pdf" target="_self"> $104,663.</a>  But they say my qualifications have expired and they don't acknowledge them.  They don't acknoweldge my applications for training they don't acknoweldge my applications for employment they don't acknoweldge any of the writing on my writing page as writing.  They don't work.  They are broken. They no read-y the English.  They do not speak it. 
                            </p>

                            
                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  They aren't progressing the filings. They are refusing to supply applications, refusing to process applications on their academic merits.  Apparently it isn't a matter of public interest how they pick and choose people to pass themsleves off as 'doctors' in our hospitals.

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  Demanding me to pay more and more and more money to the courts else they force all my cases aborted, or abandoned.  <a href="judicial-review/sc-eyes.pdf" target="_self"> Here is the Judgement of the Supreme Court that I am attempting to appeal on the grounds that it is manifestly grotesquely unjust. </a>  It is like they have their eyes poked out.  Our highest court does not seem to have the conception of justice, at all.  It was the courts decision to delay Roe v University of Waikato proceedings until AFTER Roe v NZVCC and also until AFTER Roe v University of Auckland.  The Judge for Roe v NZVCC made all kinds of pronouncement in his judgment on the matter of Roe v University of Waikato.  That is to say instead of judging the issue he was supposed to be judging (the inaction of Chris Whelan in his capacity as CE of the NZVCC) he thought he would weigh in on whether or not I had done enough for completion of the MPhil Degree.  Clearly that is a matter of the Judge of a different case to decide!

                             <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  The Australian Constitution clearly names New Zealand as a state of Australia.  They say that they don't have to honor the constitution because New Zealand officials did not turn up to various things and they did not consent.  I don't know why Australia would care about consent in that instance.  Did they care about the consent of the Aboriginal people of Australia?  Did they care about consent of people to be immunised or subject to medical treatments or experimentation?  If they want to change the constitution then there is a process for it to be changed.  I think it involves a vote.  But New Zealanders don't get to vote so the Australian Government clearly does not care whether or not the people of New Zealand consent.  New Zealand functions as a detention camp of Australia.  But then, Australia still seems to govern like it is a detention camp of the Northern Hemisphere, so...

                            <p>Una Jagose doesn't seem to have the job of instructing Crown Law to prosecute corruption within New Zealand Universities, or within the Judiciary (where judges refuse to accept evidence and where the supreme court punishes people for bringing injustices before the courts).  I suppose that is why they pay her more than half a million dollars to do that job.  They pay her to ensure the job is not done by anyone.  Not by her and not by anybody else.  The fact she is in the job prevents and prohibits the job being filled  by anyone with the willingness and ability to do the job.  It seems there is no evidence that they will accept that would attest to corruption.  None of the invoicing information that I provided (e.g., 0.5 EFTS = 120 points = 60 points = indefinate enrolment).  New Zealand does not appear to have a functioning judiciary.    <p> <a href="judicial-review/crown-law.pdf" target="_self"> Blow off response. </a>

It all starts to sound confusing, doesn't it.  The gaslighting garbage output nonsense nonsene nonsense from the courts.  Denying the evidence.  Refusing to acknowledge the half of the laws that speak to the duties and responsiblities and actual job descriptions of the various government departments (e.g, the NZVCC and various of the Universities).

    <p>Evidence of corruption.  <a href="writing/lawsociety.pdf" target="_self">Letter from the Law Society (PDF)</a></p>

    <p> Here we have a letter from the Law Society that declares that Philip Cornege is conflicted out of representing a party when his wife (K Cornege) has been employed by opposing counsel. 

     <a href="writing/conflict.eml" target="_self">Here is a letter from me to the Court of Appeal informing them of Phillip and K Cornege being being employed by opposing counsel in certain matters of corruption to be heard in the Court of Appeal (.eml). </a>  (The file format is .eml which means it will use your browser or your email programme to open the text file).  I notified Una Jagose of the conflict on April 25 2021 at 7:24pm by email.  K Cornege responded to me as follows:  'Phillip does not act for the Commissioner of Police, but for MAP and Associates Trustee Company Limited.  There is no conflict between our respective clients, whose interests are aligned for the purposes of the High Court proceeding and appeal.  I recognise that the Court of Appeal list is somewhat confusing as to who acts for whom.' Yes.  I am confused.  K Cornege and P Cornege are on different sides of the 'v' which means they are acting on opposing sides with respect to these proceedings.  Me soooooooooooo confuuuuuuused.  Yeeeeeeees.  That must  be the problem. The response I received from the Court of Appeal was to say 'as you are not a party to this proceeding we are unable to discuss matters of party representation with you. No correspondence will be entered in to regarding it.'  That is how the Court of Appeal saw fit to respond to my concern by email on 2 October at 10:24am.  That is to say they (to the best of my knowledge) refused to look into the conflict and / or refused to do anything at all about the apparent conflict.</p>

    <p>K Cornege of Thompkins Wake also pointed out to me that the finding of P Cornege being conflicted out of representing anybody who was opposed by the University of Waikato since they had put a dollar in her pocket - was a finding that I was supposed to keep secret and not publicise.  That he sat on filings for several months only later to claim to be conflicted out was also something that I was supposed to keep secret and not publicise.  If the Law Society had seen fit to do it's job properly then I wouldn't need to publicise it becuase things would have been dealt with internally, in house.  But the Law Society brushed off my complaint / blew off my complaint.  So I now inform the public so they know what kind of people they may be dealing with.  I see that P Cornege is now claiming on his website to be employed by the Government for the abuse in state care inquiry.  I wonder if this is because they have collected up evidence of him being willing to delay proceedings and being willing to blame the complainant (e.g., construe Roe v University of Waikato as my being upset I did not get my qualification rather than an issue to do with how they are incorrectly invoicing students and how they are mishandling official thesis documents etc).
    </p>

    <p>You can see from the letter that the Law Society said I needed to pay them $50 if I wanted to take the complaint further.  I should pay for the corruption in the Law Profession.  I should pay the Law Society who is supposed to collect fees from Lawyers to uphold the integrity of the Law Profession.  I did the filings for taking the complaint further so they could take a look and see whether Philip Cornege and K Cornege were behaving appropriately as lawyers (hey, they picked them out all special like to be graduates of New Zealand Law Degrees and they picked them out all special like to be registered to practice Law in New Zealand)..  I filed that IF Mr Cornege was in fact conflicted out (as the Law Society found that he was) THEN he did not get to have a professional opinion on the mertits of the case.  That is to say, if he is conflicted out, then it is not appropriate for him to choose to delay proceedings for a couple months and then refuse to file anything other than a statement that he did not see merits in the case.  He tried to throw the case, in other words.  He was conflicted and how he chose to manage or handle the conflict was to tell me that the case was not a matter of law (not a matter of misuse of official document and incorrect invoicing of the government by keeping false records about enrolmetn and keeping false records about progression through qualification by re-enrolling a studnet in programmes they had never even applied to) and so on.  Instead, he tried to blame me for being personally upset that they did not give me the qualification.  Of course I was also personally upset but I wasn't expecting the law to do anything about personal upset.  Justice and fairness and upholding the law is supposed to be what the law is about. It is more than a little concerning that the Corneges and indeed the Supreme Court Injustices don't seem to have the conception.  Or maybe they just don't have the ability.

    <p>Universitites, District Health Boards, Government Departments are not being fair in the way they handle (actually mis-handle) applications.  Concrete examples.  The University of Waikato wanted to have a yakkity yak yak yak yak yak about why I had not been ranked for PhD (doctoral) scholarship in their meeting about who was going to be granted doctoral scholarships when I never applied to the doctoral programme with that University.  The Waikato District Health Board advertised a $5,000 masters research scholarship where the successful candidate was to give a talk to the DHB.  I have repeatedly asked (including under OIA) for the name of the receipient of that scholarship in 2018 because I have a strong suspicion that they did not give the funding to any actual student and instead decided to have a party party party for themselves.  They refuse to supply me with information as to when the student gave their talk to the DHB and where there masters research thesis actually is so that I can see the project that they funded with public money (yeah, right).
    </p>

    <p>New Zealand is a shit-hole (as is Australia) because the leaders won't have it any other way.  Suck up, suck up, suck up.  Everything is entirely and totally at the discretion of this, that, and the other person.  Does this person really have the power to decide on personal grounds whether this, that, or the other  happens?  Well, better do anything anything anything they say.  Just in case.  You can always say you were just following orders, right?  Wasn't me.  The singularity ordered it.  I wasn't driving that car or that drone or the tank.  It was the singularity that did it.  No people.  Nobody home.  Nothing to see.
    </p>

    <p>There is no health system. No education system.  To training system.  No functioning judiciary.  Parliament is a joke or a fraud.  I mean, c'mon, they pull a piece of paper seemingly randomly from out of a biscut tin and squabble in front of a guy sitting on a sheepskin throne who orders the sprinkers to be turned on to anybody who thinks that this ia a fucking hoax of a fraud of a farce of a situation.  We don't have medical doctors.  Too busy getting in behind the likes of Dr Leeks.  All of the money and the power and the titles for him.  Nobody else wanted to do it.  See?  No other Medical Graduates.  Nobody else got registration with the professional body or association.  There's  nothing to see.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  They are building the bomb shelters now, under the children's hospitals.  Of course.  I mean, where else would you build a bomb shelter but under the children's hospital.  No health system no education system no judiciary nothing nothing nothing at all.
    </p>

    <p>I am sick to death of all the f*cking excuses about why I don't count and why the laws don't apply to me.  Everybody is like 'you think the laws don't apply to you'.  And it's like 'I know you are but what am I?'  I mean...  What is the appropriate response or reply, here?  They think that the laws don't apply to anybody at all.  That's how they live their lives.  They just do whatever they want whenever they want because they want.  Hand out grades on non-academic grounds for whatever reasons they want, hand out applications (or withhold applications) for whatever reasons they want.  And so on.  Apparently my grades don't count because they were handed out before they really got underway with the whole grade-fixing thing (as in giving all the best grades to the teachers and administrators kids or the people who pay the most in bribes).  That's why my grades don't count.  And because it's a fucking embarrassment when you compare all the work that I've done against all the work that the people on payroll have done.  I mean, I get that when you edit a journal you get to delay receipt of publication until you have bullied the junior people into fleeing with no credit at which point you can distribute the credit to other parties.  Right?  That's how Sterelny made his career?  Right?  Being an editor of a journal being sent everybodies work for him to distribute around as he sees fit.  He sees fit to make Carl Brusse enrol in PhD x2 otherwise Carl Brusse doesn't get credit for 360 points or 3 EFTS of research work.  Right?  He doesn't acknowledge any of the work that Carl Brusse did on personal identity etc.  No.  He will give Carl Brusse some work that Carle Brusse can pass off as his own and take credit for.  Work written by Carl Brusse taking all of the things that Sterelny gave him to say and saying that only.  Right?  That's how it goes?  Progressively replace it with plagarised stuff.  That's what they like to try and teach at Auckland.  Wah wah wah Maaori can't do academics because we won't accept any work from them that is not sufficiently plagarised.  Hey, I know...  Let's write about how it's morally obligatory to uplift children and arrange for them to be abused in state care (but only if their parents aren't abusing them sufficiently at home or the schools haven't arranged for them to be sufficiently abused there).  Not exactly the developed world.  Nothing to see...  Nothing nothing nothing at all...
    </p>

    <p>So apparently NZ is going to open up immigration to old people, now.  We got the euthanasia drugs, especially.  I mean, we had the highest rates of child abuse (physical, sexual, psychological) and look how much money we made!  Look at how much money we collected from people who arranged to have their kids sent here and abused by various people, in New Zealand.  Well, the quality of our aged care institutions preceeds the opening of immigration to all the elderly people of the world.  Roll up roll up roll up for everything it is that you value!  New Zealand.  Quite the sh*t show.  Not even the teensiest bit of 'try'.  Do you see evidence of 'try'?  I don't...  I keep loooking (not doing the confirmation bias thing) but I don't see evidence of 'try'.  Do you?

    <p>14 October 12:18pm</p>

    <p>Australia thinks that if New Zealand is made to look worse then Australia will look better by default.  In other words, instead of Australia focusing on improving, Australia can focus on undermining and stabotaging New Zealand.  Force New Zealand to be a costly fitness trap on the world stage, right, Sterelny?  Make Australia look positively *attractive* by way of comparison only.  
    </p>

    <p>Evidence for this is how various high-quality New Zealanders get hand-picked out (all special-like) as something along the lines for reward for their service in undermining and stabotaging New Zealand.  For example, Dr Leeks.  Most esteemed Psychiatrist.   I mean, it wasn't like anybody else wanted to do it, it wasn't like anybody else had the capacity to do it.  He was the only game in town.  He was the 'there is no alternative'.  And for all the hard work that he did pimping out the kids to...  The only church leaders who the government hadn't imprisoned, and the like...  His reward was to be shipped to Melbourne so he could continue on his offending against the people of Melbourne.  When it was time for him to be held to account for his crimes he allegedly or apparently died.  Yeah right.  Where did they ship him next?  Brisbane?  Another example:  All the work that the Sterelny's did on slavery and psychopathy.  Must  have.  All the high quality supervision they provided.  I mean, it isn't like anybody else wants to have academic careers.  Right?  It isn't like New Zealand has graduates.  It isn't like the Universities will pay graduates to work in them.  Is it 1 academic per 1,000 kids, now?  Who runs the tutorials?  The second years tutor the first years. But I think you need to pay Crimson Education (the only kind of business that can exist or subsist or persist in New Zealand) for the questions or the answers or both.  Right?  That's a model of a New Zealand start-up, right there.  Brought to you by the University of Auckland, wasn't it?  Helping them decide how they were going to fix the grades.  I am not saying that the person who pays the most money gets the places in Medicine.  It is more the hint hint wink wink nudge nudge maybe...  Just maybe...  Just maybe...  Oooooh.  How much do you want to do it?  How much will people pay?  How much did Dr Leeks pay to get to commit atrocities against the New Zealand people?  HOw much did he pay to get to commit atrocities against the Australian people?  How much did the government pay him in order to do those things?  How much does the government pay to ensure that only these kinds of people are the only game in town.  Harlene Hayes.  Quite the number that she did on the University of Otago.  you should live-stream the Ethics seminars and the Psychology Seminars and quite a few of the other Seminars.  So the people can see the kinds of seminars.  They are practically pulling out the gibbet cages.  That appears to be the function of much of it.  They get people giving seminars on how they are planning to change the laws of New Zealand so that they can do experiments on people with alzheimer's and dementia without their consent and so on and so forth.  Medical atrocities, in other words.  They get people giving seminars on how they falsely accuse people of crimes, unlawfully detain them, do not read them their Miranda Rights (torture them into speaking and false confessions, refuse to allow them lawyers etc).  These are the sorts of seminars that they have while filming the reactions or responses of the attendees.  Not a University.  Hey.  Nothing to see.  Nothing nothing nothing, at all.

    <p>Australia thinks it funny (haha) that New Zealand functions as a back door for Australia.  It likes to think that New Zealand is a little slave or detention camp and it can pick out whomever it wants for whatever arbitrary reasons it wants and promote those people to Australia.  But look at the people who they choose to promote to Australia.  They wanted Dr Leeks.  Must have.  They wanted the Sterelny's.  They wanted Harlene Hayes.  Where is Stuart McCutcheon?  Where is Ashley Bloomfield?  He earned how many millions of dollars in their public servant roles?  How many millions of dollars?  About half a million dollars each, supposedly, or apparently.  For how many years of work?  What currency did they try and convert into?  At what point does that kind of thing undermine the currency of New Zealand?  I mean, how are the Americans supposed to think or feel about Ashley earning more than Fauci (given the exchange rate)?  How much money should have to pay to get his kids into Harvard so they can go party with Fauci's kids?  The value of the New Zealand dollar.  When the civil servants of New Zealand try and launder the money out.
