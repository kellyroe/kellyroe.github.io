                            <article>

                                <p>Many people say that 'it is not about the money -- it is about everything else'.  I mean to say, the government says that people leave for higher wages but the NZ government cannot compete with the wages they offer overseas.  So all our qualified skilled people apparently leave for paid employment overseas because they pay them more wages overseas.  That's the mythology.  But it isn't that they pay them less in NZ.  It isn't about the money.  It is about everything else.  It is about how they are treated like garbage disposable rubbish crap.  The lowly wages (the non-existent wages, the 'you pay us and we will call you an employee' is just a reflection of how poorly how badly how horribly they keep everyone.  People don't leave because they get paid MORE overseas.  They leave because they are treated (personally) like stupid garbage crap in NZL.  Why are people supposed to WANT or CHOOSE to stay in NZ rather than leaving for overseas for better pay?  Apparently 'the people the people the people'.  Oh.  Never was it so easy to keep slaves.  To treat others badly.  To do anything anything to the scum of the earth...  Than it was in NZL.  Real destination for degerates,  hey.  Flocking here, they are.  Because of stupids like Jacinda telling the Harvard Graduates they can come here and to their gene studies (knock out babies trying to breed  slave class who won't complain) and nobody every was or will be prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus etc.  Selling out the health of the people.  Selling out the people.  What people.  Treat them like food or meat animals.  Slaves.  Degenerate criminals.  It isn't that there isn't enough money.  They say how they spend it.  All of these f*cking people not outputting any researhc on research payroll.  All of these managing marketing administrators.  All fo these people advertising jobs, refusing to process applicaions, having interviews.  Just wasting everyones time when it's just a waste of time.  The paid position was always going to go to x because of who his mummy was.  Degenerate wasteland by design.  There's nothing here.  No try.</p>

                                <p>Besides, we don't want people to CHOOSE to stay here.  We want the 'there is no alternative' people.  We want to accept visa applications only from those who THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE.  We want to enrol the PHD studnets when they weren't accepted in to any other programme in any other land.  We want the people who THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE.  So that they have no alternative whatsoever for how poorly we are going to treat them, now.  Slave camp wasteland.  We intentinonally market for the garbage of the world to come here when there is no alternative for them.  Save the other nations the expense of prosecuting the criminals.  Offer them a job in NZ>  Blackbird for them.  Lure them here with fake promises.  THen, once they've arrived they can see.  There is no health system, education system, judiciary.  There is nothing here.  Quite by design.  And now they are stuck here.  Hey.  And the only way they get anything is if they kill off various others first.  Hey.  Gnawing each others arms off.  By design.  Degenerate wasteland for criminal undesirables  by design.  Always was.  Overseas won't acknowledge any other leaders for NZ.  You go Jacinda.  Sell NZ (give it away) to the grads of Harvard.  So they can send their undesirable degenerates to NZL.  Only, we prefer to put it that they were lured here with false promises.  They can do anything anything anything so long as they pay the univesrity they pay the univesrity they pay the judicairy they pay teh judiciary they pay the government they pay they pay they pay.  Nowehere..  Is more corrupt than..  NZL.  QUite by design.  F*cking degenerate wasteland full of prisoners and slaves.  Nobody in their right might would voluntarily choose to stay here.  Quite by design.</p>

                                <p>Why would you choose to stay here?  Only reason..  Uh...  Uh..  Oh.  Must be the trickle down economics.  Nowehre else in teh world is it to easy to have soooooooo maaaaany deeeependents.  By design.  </p>

                                <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/131602239/by-the-numbers-overdue-overseas-student-debt-passes-milestone-2-billion-mark  My student loan debt is more than 100,000.  My full time GPA is 8.6.  As acknowledged by Univesrity of Auckland lawyers.  They accept that is my full time GPA.  But NZ keeps me...  Refuses to acknowledge I've done enough research, now, for a PhD.  Refuses to employ me.  I have a first division first class masters.  Auckland says they don't acknowledge qualifiations obtained more than 5 years ago.  So why do they think I owe them more than 100,000 for qualifications that they deem expired?  They won't pay me.  They won't pay me.  They won't pay me.  There is no skilled labor job for me.  THey will hire unqualified people (e.g., Ashley Bloomfield who never did a research PHD or MD who has on research output).  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camp land.  Now they plan to stop people leaving at the border. The aim is to have the most highly trained and skilled and qualified slaves in the world, is it?  Is that the plan.  People left becuase they wouldnl't pay them to work, here.  They wouldn't pay them skilled wagees for skilled work.  They gve all the skilled employment to people who don't do the f*cking job for which they are paid.  Garbage dump of a waste land.</p>


                                <p>Waikato University is a nasty piece of work, hey.  Look at all the people they chose to hire to have the 'primary function of research' (that's what the Education and Training Act says is the primary function of a university) who..  Don't do any research, at all.  They are too busy going off on family holidays, right Justine?  Too busy enjoying all the teaching recesses that they have to do any actual f*cking research.  Too busy going to meeting after meeting after meeting when they can take more and more and more and more and more research from their studnets and bully their studnets into handing over more and more and more work so they can go 'garbage garbage garbage move this here and that there.  Take that out. Replace it with this.  Take you out.  Replace it with me.  So it will go out to externals and they can say rubbish rubbish garbage garbage this isn't research!  All of the research funding for me!'  NZ Universities hire people from overseas rather than hiring graduates of NZ Unviersities.  Tehy won't even graduate people from NZ Univesities if they think they are actually productive researchers.  Various people who get all the research funding will collect it well into their retirement, of course.  Or..  I don't know.  Maybe the government just never actually pays anybody to do it, at all, and they just pretend.  Maybe Ashley Bloomfield got given an honorary knighthood precisely because they didn't pay him anything at all.  Got him a fancy suit and arranged for his drycleaning.  But he actually lives in the government institution and they only let him out to do his television Bloomfield broadcasts once a day, or similar.  Garbage dump of a garbage waste land.</p>

                                <p>You can look at the people they hire in the Philosophy programmes in NZ.  Varoius new people have been hired.  Foreigners rather than NZers.  Or, when they hire NZers take a look at the research output that was apparently enough for them to be the best candidate for the job, the most qualified hire, of, of course, the only game in town.  The only applicant.  There were no other applications they received.  That they didn't throw out before selection etc.  Check out the amount of research they did...  To get to be permanently on payroll.  Now...  Were they paid to do research?  Or where they paid for the prevention and prohibitnion of research? Was their job to never graduate their students who had demonstrated capacity so that they would be the only game in town?  Were they payrolled only because they would play their part in taking the work from those with capacity and handing it over to PRinceton and the like.  Because it turns out that when Princeton takes various people's money so they can claim to have a PhD from a fancy institution they need to take work from various slaves and pass it off as their own.  The supervisors take teh students work out (insofar as they do any) and replace it with various things, you see.  Have the students build up plagarised research output incrementally like that.  Fail everybody else.  Then take the research work that they faile dand pass it off as their own.  The only game in town.  That is or means to say it is not an education and training system at all.  There is actually nothing there.  Psychopaths.  Slave camp.  Prison camp.  Detention camp.  Bums on seats.  For how many decades is the bum to be kept on the seat before it is time for them to be paid?  Where is the payroll?  Where is my payroll?  Where is my payroll?  F*CKING PSYCHOPATHS.  F*CKING PSYCHOPATHS.  F*CKING RETARD IMBECELS NOT EVEN TRYING TO BE FAIR>  HOW MANY DECADES NOW???  FUCKING RETARDS.  Where is your research output Justine???  WHere is it???   Do you do, like, 2,0000 words per year?  Could you possibly work any f*cking slower ffs?  Allllllllll of the tenured positions for you.  So that you can refuse to sign off on anything not you so that you can never ever ever ever retire.  Alllllll of the cancer care for you...</p>

                                <p>There is this thing that people do...  They go 'who do you like most or best, them or me?'  And you are supposed to go 'aw, I like you best of course'.  But my response is that 'I don't like you very much right now for putting me in that position where I have to choose'  Why do I have to like someone most?  Because it's soooo competitive.  You get people who try and force people into positions of choosing 'you have to choose, him or me?  Who do you like most?'  Whoever is for me is against him.  Whoever is with him is against me.  It's sooooo competitive.  There isn't enough room in the world for all three of us.  We will have to try and conspire to kill one off.  One winner.  One follower.  And one deceased.  It's sooooo competitive.  I choose...  Not the person who likes to play that stupid game.  I call it a stupid game for stupid f*cking psychopaths because it turns out that people who like to play that game are people who like to go around calling 'losers' 'psychopaths' and 'mentally defective' etc etc.  To dress that up in fancy language, even.  Because they are the only psychiatrists in town and so on.  Only people who the judges couldn't throw in prison for their crimes, or similar.</p>

                                <p>NZ doesn't want to develop training and education systems because they have no interest in paying people they would rather keep as hostages or slaves.  The leaders would be thrilled if they were the only people in the entire nation who were acknoweldged as being capable of critical thinking, maths, reading, etc.  Then they could set the social policy and do anything they want and so on.  Feel superior.  Take the best of everything and keep other people as poorly and badly as they like.  Dependents.  Hostages.  Slaves.  F*cking garbage dump of a wasteland.</p>

                                <p>I've tried speaking nicely and rationally and so on and THEY DON'T F*CKING LISTEN.  Alllllllllllll of the money for them.  Tap tap tap on their shoulder 'get us your CV, just as a formality, we aren't really going to consider any other applicant for that job, we will throw all the applications away ensuring none of them are actually processed according to their merits so that your position on the social hierarchy can be maintained'.  Not even trying to be fair.  The least meritous with the most to lose if things were to be a meritocracy.  And of course either they win else they lose.  They are slavers or they are slaves.  There is no middle ground or position.  NO justice or fairness at all.  Their way or no way at all.  They would rather die than give up their position as lords.  F*cking stupids.  Black and white thinking.  Not even trying to be fair.  F*cking retards.</p>

                                <p>I mean, what's the f*cking idea supposed to be?  That if you roll up to the hospital with enough dependents in tow you will actually get healthcare?  If you can say that you have however many children or adults who will all die if you don't get your payroll then they will try and help you live?  Is that the plan?  The ideology,  here?  The more depenendents you have, the more people you keep dependent on you, the more people want you to live so that you can keep more and more dependents.  Is that the idea?  So if you present without dependents then it is time for you to die, but if you present with all the people you keep dependent then that means you are value.  I mean, your life has value.  The more value to your life the more hostages you keep dependent on you?  Not even trying for equality.  Fairness.  Frontal lobe deficiency?  DOesn't really matter why.  Fact is that they are not even trying to be fair at all.  F*cking psychopaths.  It's soooooooooo competitive.  Sooooo competitive to see who can be most indespensible.  I mean to say most despensible.  Who needs to go so that other people may live  because they refused to allow things to be any other way.  F*cking psychopaths.  The people who plan not to retire are of course the people who get all of of the money for the keeping of slaves.  They don't want to give up their position as slaver.  They quite like things to be held or kept in that way.  Alllll of the money for htem in the  name of 'trickle down economics'.  Only game in town.  F*cking retards.</p>

                                <p>Judiciary doesn't work because there aren't any judges.  Aren't any lawyers.  No University graduates, apparently.  Make sure you pay for health insurance, everyone, so you can have all the fluffy towels.  So they can do their very very very very best to introduce a fungus or antibiotic resistent bacteria.  There will be a job for them only over your dead body -- right?  It's soooooo competitive.  Alllll of the  helping themselves to you by the unpaid slaves 'working' the 'helping professions'.  All of the paid administrators of the mismanagement of the 'we believe in trickle down economics which means we take all of the money and piss all over you' f*cking psychopaths of the f*cking dump that is this land.  NOT EVEN TRYING TO BE FAIR.  There is nothing here, by design.  Nasty fitness trap for psychopaths.  Nobody would voluntarily choose to be born in this f*cking dump of a land.  NOT EVEN TRYING TO BE FAIR.</p>

                                <p>Do a f*cking audit, then.  All the people who were signed off as having done enough for PhD from the ANU.  How much work they produced in what amount of time.  Then if the externals thought it was enough for a PhD.  Their work was sooooo much better than mine, was it?  That they get sign off?  That they get paid employment?  That they aren't to be kept as a f*cking slave handing over more and more and more work for no f*cking credit.  F*cking psychopaths.  For f*cking sure.</p>

                                <p>So we can appoint Ashley Bloomfield to be a paid academic (with no research output, no PhD, no MD, he never applied tot hose progarmmes, never did the f*cking work for those qualifications.  It's not a skilled labor job, apparently.  University Academic.  No training was required to staff it with someone who was never trained for the position.  Check out the medical doctor and surgeon people in NZ.  The ones passing themselves off as.  So long as they pay the university enough...  THey are looking for the next Dr Leeks so win win.  Right?  It's  not a skilled labor thing at all.  NO training is required.  No education background at all is required for 'alternative' entry to MBChB with Otago.  They will take enrolments from Australians who have never ever studied at Univesrity level and so long as they pay the University they will pass them off as qualified doctors in our hospitals.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>Max Rashbrook says we don't invest in re-training a workforce.  We also don't invest in training a workforce.  I mean, more than 100,000 dollars of debt is recorded against my name and how many years of my working?  By 'working' I mean me handing research over to the university.  How many hundreds of thousands of words of research have I handed over to various universities over decades of my life, now?  And it's all A's until it's time for them to say 'enough of the ''training'' it is time for you to be paid!'  More and more and more and more and more research work from me.  While they keep me on government welfare payments only saying I haven't done enough for so much as a PhD.  What about my investment in training, then?  Oh.  That's  not an investment.  That's being kept as a hostage slave or prisoner.  That's what that is.  What 'training'.  What did they even try and teach me?  What training system?  Apparently I owe the NZ government hundreds of thousands of dollars for 'essentials' like emergency housing and various 'training programmes' that they enrolled me in without my even applying to those programmes.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  Garbage dump of a f*cking garbage wasteland.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  ALlllll of the money for you Max Rashbrook.  So that you can ensure your studnets are not trained, not graduated.  You can simply take their work and pass it off as your own else give it away or sell it to people overseas.  Keep slaves.  What training system?  There's nothing here.</p>
                                <p>
                                    How much research work are you supposed to do for a 120 point Masters Qualification?  How about a 240 point 2 year Masters Qualification (with one year of course work and one year of research)?  How much work are you supposed to do for a 360 point thesis (extendible to 480 points)?  You are supposed to work for a time...  1 year or 2 years or 3 years or 4.  And then they are supposed to get your work out to external examiners so that it can be assessed on it's academic merits and they can decide whether you have done enough work for credit, or whether you have been loafing and not doing your work.
                                </p>

                                <p>I started my PhD with the Australian National University in 2006 (after working for more than 2 academic years on a 120 point Masters Research project) and the Australian National University never got my work out for external examination.  Never did.  You can see a more than 100,000 word document that I gave to my supervisor on the writing page.  He never got it to externals, never gave me comments on it.  Nothing.  I left Australia without it going out to externals for external examination at all.   
                                </p>

                                <p>Lots of students did.  Left Canberra before their thesis was sent out for external examination -- if it ever was.  I'm not actually sure whether any of the doctoral studnets work was actually sent out for external examination, or how they were picking and choosing what students they were acknowledging as having done enough for a PhD.  I mean to say, I remember Nick Southwood saying that he did everything his supervisor told him to do (as did I) and he had been informed that the external examiners had accepted his thesis without any changes or alternations being required to it, at all.  I am not sure how plausible this is now, however.  I guess I think it was actually more likely that they never sent it out for external examination at all.   They simply told him that he had done enough for a PhD.  None of the Australian National University doctoral students had oral examinations or defences at the end of their PhD.  So nobody from overseas or international community actually got to question them about their doctoral research to even see if they understood the work that they were credited as being the author of.  It seemed to be at the discretion of their supervisor to say they had done enough. </p>


                                <p>
                                You can see on the seminars page various seminars that I wrote while I was a PhD student in Australia.  Written talks that I read to various conferences.  The work that I did while I was at the ANU working on a 3 or 4 year research PhD program.  How much work are you supposed to do for a PhD?  How many seminars (articles) are enough?  You can also see a book chapter with OUP where I was a co-author.  You might say 'they didn't send your work out for external examination because they themselves judged it to be garbage'.  But the thing is that it is supposed to be externally examined by people who don't have an interest in keeping their research students slaving for them handing all their work over to their supervisors without their supervisors acknowledging them as the author of the work at all.  Who knows what the supervisors do with the work they get from students (or people submitting to their journals).  Take it for themselves or reattribute it to their friends.  Keep it as trophies in their basement?  It needs to be externally and independently examined because otherwise the supervisors keep slaves.  Obviously.  Never sign off on their students.  Or, what?  It is at their discretion whether or not their studnets are acknowledged as the author of their own work?  Relies on their good-will?  The kindness of their hearts?  What do you have to do then?  Anything anything anything?  Pay a bribe?  Go camping?  Just one more camping trip?  One more drink? </p>

                                <p>My work was judged to be of high enough quality by the ANU from my writing samples for me to be given a summer research scholarship to the ANU.  And my research over the summer and my subsequenet writing samples were judged to be of high enough quality by the ANU for me to be enrolled there to work on my doctoral thesis.  And my progress was deemed to be enough for them to keep enrolling me and keep me working in the programme.  For how many years?  And then (after I've been working for many years in excess) they say that I'm garbage and rubbish.  When it is time for them to credit me as having done enough for a PhD so I can be applying for tenured positions and research positions.  That's a convenient time to bully someone into not having credit because you think they are garbage.  Corruption. </p>

                                <p>Apparently the issue is that there will be a job for me over there dead bodies.  They have tenured positions.  They apply for and get all the research funding.  Them and the people who depend or rely on them.  Their dependents.  There is no alternative to them and their dependents.  They don't sign off on independents.  They keep dependents only.  They keep people who they believe to be dependent on them.  </p>

                                <p>When I returned to NZ I wanted to train to do Medicine.  Something with an academic and also practical aspect or element.  Bullied out or away from Philosophy.  There will be a job for me over their dead  bodies, apparently.  More graduates than there are positions in Philosophy.  There won't be a job for me in Philosophy anywhere in the world.  They won't allow me to even apply.  Withhhold the PhD.  So their dependents can be the only game in town.  The only applicants.    There is a shortage of Medical Doctors, apparently.  Unlike philosophy positions where there are more people with Philosophy PhD's than there are academic posts in Philosophy so even if you have a PhD there likely won't be an academic post or position for you.  You'd have to wait for the people currently in those posts or positions to die.  Is what they keep telling me.  Job for you over our dead bodies.  We are the only game in town.  All the money for us.  All the money for us to keep studnets re-enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled.  Handing over more and more and more research work for us to reattribute.  I wanted to do something practical to help people.  Learn and have knowledge and help other people obtain the information they need to make informed health decisions.  I was told by Auckland University that I needed to complete a new qualification from a NZ university to be 'eligible' to apply to Medicine.  I asked specifically if a 120 point MPhil from Waikato would be enough and they said it would.  So I applied to enrol in that.   Because Auckland advised me to.  I did everything they said I needed to do.  Even when the statute says that as a domestic adult I was eligible.  They did not have authority to create additional hoops for me to jump through.  But I did what they said, and they are not even trying to be fair, at all.  I worked on the Masters research project from 05 March 2018 under supervision (have emails from my supervisor directing me to finding readings and acknowledging recepipt of my writing) and the University refused to get my thesis submission of 14 September out for external examination.  </p>

                                <p>They said I needed to keep working or I would never get credit for completing a Masters thesis.  I kept working (did what they said) and they send 05 October Masters thesis submission out for instructions for externals to examine it as a 'doctoral thesis'.  Since the externals were required to examine the masters thesis as a doctoral thesis they could only say that more work would be needed.</p>

                                <p>So I keep working on the thesis.  THey refuse to get my thesis submission of 05 January out to external examiners.  They refuse to get my thesis submission of 24 January out to external examiners.  They send the June 30 thesis submission out for 'masters examination' (So it would be externally examined for 3 months after I had been working on it for well over 1 year) and the interntional external examiner says that at that point they want an oral examination.  The New Zealander external examiner says that she accepts that the University of Waikato failed me.  The University of Waikato updates my transcript to say that I was enrolled in various programmes of study I never applied to be enrolled in (much more than 120 points of MPhil) and that I failed.  F.  They are keeping false student enrolment records and false transcripts and they are refusing to get studnets work to external examiners who can examine it on it's academic merits. </p>
 
                                <p>The external NZ examiner was Carolyn Mason of Canterbury.  She was supposed to be anonymous but the University made the information availabe to me over student portal at one point.  I wonder what Carolyn Masons research output was over the 2018 academic year.  She thinks there are too many problems with giving me credit or recognition or qualilfication for having done 1 year of research in 2018.  What research did she do to justify her being paid a tenured position as a philosophy academic, then?  University employees primary function is supposed to be research.  What research did she do, then, that she thinks she should get tenure while I should be sent away from the University without any credit at all for the 1 year research that I did.  Where is her students work that was signed off as being enough for a 1 year masters, then?  Show me the work that was signed off as being enough for a 1 year masters.  I want to see it.  So we can compare the quality of my academic work with the quality of others who were signed off.  Oh..  Nobody was signed off.  Is that right?  There will be a job for other people only over her dead body.  All the money is her entitlement, you see.  So nobody else can be signed off as having completed any research.  She can be the only applicant for research funding.  Only game in town.  Nobody else applied for that position.  </p>

                                <p>The Vice Chancellor tells me to complain to the Ombudsman and the courts if I have a problem with how the University of Waikato isn't getting studnets work out to externals, isn't keeping accurate enrolment records and transcripts and the like.  The Ombudsman delays things for a year and doesn't see anything wrong (that seems to be why they pay him).  I took them to court, then, and Justice Toogood is reappointed from retirement (I don't suppose they signed off on anybody else's law degree, so there wasn't a new person to be appointed, a new person would be appointed only over Justice Toogood's dead body, apparently).  He doesn't see anything wrong with the death of Olivia Podmore (apparently she suicided but they won't release her health records to her parents) or with the death of Mason Pendrous (he rotted for a month in a residential hall.  Justice Toogood says they don't know when he died.  But he was a computer science person living in a University Hall so they would have been able to see when he stopped using his University internet).  Justice Toogood doesn't see anything wrong with the Univesrity of Waikato not getting studnets research out to externals, getting students research out to externals with instructions for them to examine it for the wrong qualification (so they can only say that more work is needed).  He doesn't have any problem with them keeping false enrolment records and false transcripts. </p>

                                <p>Turns out that the Education and Training Act states actually pretty clearly that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are in fact eligible to be enrolled in the program they have applied to.  In other words, the University of Auckland wrongly decided the outcome of my applications in 2019 and 2020.  They said I was 'ineligible' because I hadn't done enough work for the masters qualification and then because Waikato said they failed me for the Masters qualification but that is ultra vires because they don't get to decide eligibility for domestic adults.  I was eligible by statute.  Therefore they were required to apply the selection algorithm they published for selection.  They simply refused to do that.  They refused to enter my GPA into the system (last 2 years of full time study).  Would not do it.  Justice Fitzgerald acknowledged that they did not have authority to deem me eligible but she refused to find that they were required to actually process my application according to their published selection criterion and actually enrol me if my rank order score was high enough.  I likely was, which is, of course, why they refused to apply their published selection algorithm to my application.</p>

                                <p>Instead, I suppose they gave the training place that should have gone to me (if and only if my rank order score was high enough) to some surgeons son, or whatever.  Because there will be a job for new medical graduates only over the dead bodies of those who are currently on payroll to work those jobs.  </p>

                                <p>How much work are you supposed to do before you are allowed to apply for research funding?  The people getting all the funding at the moment ensure that no new applications are received.  Unless they are from people who appear obviously to be less capable else unless they are from their own dependents.</p>

                                <p>Corruption.  There is actually nothing here.  We have these people in position and they don't do the job for which they are paid.  But they take all the money for themselves.  They try and identify anyone with the capacity to do the job better than them and exterminate or annihiliate those people.  Bully them away.  Take their work outputs and steal them for themselves or give them away.  The judiciary in NZ fails to function.  They refuse to do anything about this situation.  Indeed, Justice Toogood (also Mander, I think) were specifically pulled out of their retirement and put back on payroll to refuse to accept the evidence I brought before them, refuse to acknowledge half the statutory laws.  What is the worst thing that can happen to them failing to find in the interests of justice?  Removal from office?  They werne't supposed to have been re-appointed back into office, anyway.  So they have nothing to lose.</p>

                                <p>We have these people in positions of power holding everyone else hostage.  We don't really have to wonder whhy there aren't any doctors, teachers, lawyers..  There really doesn't seem to be anything anything anything at all.  'Trickle down economics' apparently.  Where some people just take a big piss all over everybody else.  Not even trying to develop better Universities or whatever.  Just taking everything out of it.  Costly fitness trap, Sterelny would say.  Yes.  That is what he is, indeed.  That's why he's on payroll.  Right?  Better give him all your research work, then, so he can refuse to acknowledge you as the author of it.  So he can give it to other parties etc etc.  I'm sure Victoria University of Wellington wouldn't have  put him on payroll for however many years it did if he hadn't have played his part in the keeping of slaves.</p>

                                <p>So the government keeps me on disability, apparently.  Because it won't acknowledge the work that I've done.  No credit for me.  I'm such a slow worker that they don't acknowledge any research output from me, at all.  THey don't acknowledge my masters research our doctoral research.  I did a different masters research for Waikato before I went to Australia to work on my PhD.  I mean to say, Auckland wanted me to repeat a masters level qualifiation after I'd done one already because they said that they thought that qualifications expired and were no longer acknowledge 5 years post-graduation.  That was why I needed to do a second masters, apparently.  TO be 'eligible' to study Medicine.  Where is the previous masters?  It wasn't in the Univesrity of Waikato Philsophy Department.  The University of Waikato is not acknowledging the research outputs of the studnets.  So that they can keep people on payroll who don't output any research at all. Where is Justine Kingsbury's research output for 2018?  What research did she do in that year?  Why is she on payroll when she doesn't do any research?  So that she can keep students and refuse to get the students work to external examiners  because there will only be  job for them over her dead body.</p>

                                <p>It's sooooooo competitive.  Apparently.  The race to the bottom.  The keeping of slaves.  All of the money and none of the work.  All of the work and none of the credit or recognition.  It was AFTER I wrote my 1 year research on disability and equity in medicine and public health that there was a report commissioned by the government on the topic.  Where is my credit?  Where was my research funding? Why do I have levels of debt recorded against my name only more and more and more and more debt to the University while they take my work and payroll people who don't do any?  I understand that they don't like what I have to say.  They don't have to like it to acknowledge that I did it.  I did the work.  Research output isn't supposed to be a bunch of 'yes sir yes sir everything you believe is true sir'.  Apparently Ashley Bloomfield was recently hired by Auckland University as an academic.  Where is his research  output?  Where is his MD or PhD?  Why is he qualified to be a university academic?  Because all he has to do is take his studnets work and give it away (e.g., hand it over the kids of Princeton or wherever to pass off as their own ) or pass it off as his own, or give it to his friends.  Or keep it in a trophy cabinet and not show it to anyone.  The author will get credit as having done it only over the authors dead body.  It's sooooooo competitive.</p>

                                <p>There is actually nothing there. It's just a big scummy scam.  Instead of the government paying people to work jobs they get people paying the university so that levels of debt are recorded against their name only while they hand their work over to the university else while they do work in the name of internships.  The University keeps them doing far in excess of what they were supposed to do (keeps them in excess of 1 year for 1 year credit, excess of 4 years for 4 years credit) etc.  Simply refuses to give any credit at all.  In order to payroll people who don't do any of the work.  Keeping of slaves.  HOstages.  That's the basis of the NZ economy.  What economy?  Australia isn't any better.  Can't see that the UK or US is or wants to be.  There's simply nothing there. Scummy hoax of a scummy scam.</p>

                                <p>In NZ more and more people aren't being paid for work they  have done.  The government simply won't pay them.  Teachers and the like.  The government won't pay them.  They take their employer to the employment court but even if the employment court finds that they were correct punishes them for having brought the case before the courts.  I mean to say (example) if they don't pay them $10,000 then the courts will find that they are to pay them $10,000 (maybe) - but the person who brought the case needs to pay their lawyers out of their own pocket (more than $10,000, say) and needs to pay the filing fees and costs out of their own pocket (even more than $10,000 for sure).  So they end worse off financially for having complained.  Which is the real point, of course.  To teach people that if they complain about being slaves they will only be treated worse.  If you complain about having to housesit for you supervisor,  having to feed their cats.  Having to go away on camping trips.  Having to go out to dinners and lunches and drinks.  Having to hand over many more years work than the 3 or 4 it was supposed to be.  While the supervisor simply says 'keep working keep working keep working there will be a job for you only over my dead body' then what are you supposed to do?  Oh.  Turn and walk away.  Until they find some new incompetent slaver to take their place.  There's nothing there. </p>

                                <p>Work hard everybody!  Pay ya later!</p>

                                <p>It doesn't even make any sense that there be a health system.  Only over there dead bodies.  It's soooooo competitive.  Only over there dead bodies.  They aren't going to pay the studnet ambulance drivers etc so how are they supposed to find their money?  They aren't going to pay the student nurses or doctors or whatever so how are they supposed to make their money?  Corruption...  There's nothing here...</p>

                                <p>The court of appeal ordered me to pay around $27,000 to have various cases against NZ Universities and the Vice Chancellor's Committee progress through the court of appeal.  The Social Security Appeals Authority has delayed things for over 1 year.  It has been more than 4 months since a substantive hearing and they have still not produced a judgment.  They don't think that justice is an essential need, you see.  So there isn't any problem with NZ not having a functioning judiciary.  WIth them not paying lawyers or judges.  Maybe they don't actually pay Justice Toogood when he writes a report saying he doesn't see anything wrong with the deaths of Olivia or Mason.  Maybe they don't actually pay him when he says he doesn't see anything wrong with Waikato not getting students work out to externals while they keep people on payroll who are not doing research, who are only preventing and prohibiting anybody else from being seen to be doing any research.  Maybe he does it out of his own desire to have his day in court.  I don't know if he even writes his own judgements or is simply acknowledged as the author of them.  Who knows who writes them.  I suppose some law studnet who has been told that they are to keep writing reports seeing nothing wrong otherwise they never will get their law degree.</p>

                                <p>So I guess it's time for a draft, then.  We are going to need a bunch of people to all voluntarily-like die so that certain special other snowflakes can have the lives they believe they are entitled to, else the lives they believe they are lucky enough to have found themselves living even if that means that various other people can have nothing or simply be sent off to slaughter.  It simply isn't plausible that now, where there is more co-operation or co-operativity or co-ordination interntionally...  THings like computer chips and so on.  THe internatinoal co-operation.  It simply isn't plausible (New Zealand Government) that there needs to be a draft so that you can send all the people off to die now that it's time for you to f*cking well pay them.</p>

                                <p>Various people need to stand down.  Only, that's not the thing, really.  It should not be a matter of personal conscience.  There should be systems and processes in place that allow for meritocray.  External examination by people who don't have financial or other insterests in keeping the person enslaved or recognised only after they have died.  Things haven't changed in NZ since the time of Janet Frame ffs.  When it was time for them to pay her (to teach and ideally to get creative arts funding for creative outputs) they threw her into an institution and kept her punatively.  Punatively.  What health system?  What judiciary?  What Universities?  There's nothing here.  Just a bunch of people paid far far far more than they are worth to keep slaves hostage.  Anti-meritoctracy.  We know that merit and intelligence and the like is not particularly hereditary.  Because of the lengths people go to when it comes to neptosm.  If things really were hereditary then there wouldn't be all these things in place in order to prevent and prohibit meritocracy.  People wouldn't need to throw away various other applications and various other applicants if their kids really were most meritous, you see.  And there shouldn't be any problem signing off on and acknowledging the merits and talents of other people including new people if those in the positions of power actually were most meritous.  INstead of being appointed into postion only to eliminate the competition, you see. It's sooooo competitive.  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>They joke about the 'bums on seats funding'.  That the government pays the universities money to babysit people, effectively.  Keeps the crime rate down.  They are in class.  Also the idea that the government actually sees university studnets as bums.  They are only enrolled in University (higher and higher levels of debt against their name)  because if they don't agree to sign up for training courses the government threatens to keep them on unemployment.  If they are on unemployment then the government will find a job for them.  Likely a 'job' that pays them less than they are required to pay their 'employer' for working that job.  I mean to say, you pay your employer for parking and for your uniform and for your laundering of the Uniform.  Maybe for food.  Maybe compulsory drinks.  No?  Otherwise..  I'm sure there is some individual who the government plays soooooooo muuuuuuuch to, so that they can keep you, then, on 'mates rates' rent in their house?  Maybe their bedroom, then?  Does that sound like a good idea?  Is that a nice thing to do to or for the PhD students who give you thesis (book) after thesis (book) after seminar (chapter, article) so that you can pay and pay and pay and pay the likes of Justine Kingsbury to tell everyone how they don't have the ability to think critically.  HOw this is a bad argument and that is a bad argument.  Fill up an entire course with bad arguments so that people get exposed to all the worst of the bad arguments.  Quite the curriculum you have, there, at the fine institution you like to call 'university'.  That won't get studnets work out to international community.  Because it is determined that there be nothing here.</p>

                                <p>So what did Jacinda do to get a PhD then?  It was an honor bestowed upon her publically in exhange for her reading the teleprompts in public.  So far as I can see.  To announce to the Harvard Medical Graduates, Biology Graduates, that noboody would be prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus, in NZ.  They can then look into things relatively easily and discover that nobody ever was.  Even though it was a criminal offence up until relatively recently.  NZ doesn't have a functioning health system or judiciary.  THey can come here and do anything anything anything they like.  By teh seems of it.  That's what it means to have a PhD from Harvard.  Apparently.  Where is her PhD?  Her research output?  Where is her thesis?  How about Ashley's?  Not Universities.  Not places of higher learning or research at all.  Not even trying to train a workforce.  Trying to keep slaves.  All of the work for none of the credit while recording only higher and higher and higher levels of debt against their name.  There's nothing.  Nothing worth working towards or working for.  There isn't a health system.  It's sooooo cmopetitive.  THey won't pay them.  Kickstart a gofund me for the hostages.  </p>

                                <p>The Minister for Justice and Minister for the Courts say that they can't remind the Judiciary on timely judgment expectations because that would be against the principle of the independence of the Judiciary.  So, then, what is the function of the Minister for Justice and Minister for the Courts?  If they can't so much as remind the courts on expectations for timely judgment delivery then what on earth are they doing?  What can they do?  What is the point purpose or function of having Ministers in those positions?  I suppose given the state of corruption it likely is that the Ministers do in fact use political power or pressure to alter the outcome of judgments else to prevent and prohibit the delivery of judgments.  There's really nothing here.  I don't know why we would think that they would actually count the election votes.  The supposedly elected representatives (Ayesha Verral was elected?) don't seem to care at all what the public think of them.  Why?  Because this is NZ and there is no alternative.  By design.  It's just a Harry Harlow social engineering research experiment in the prevention and prohbition of social development.  Fisher and Paykal incubator babies.  I'm so glad I'm a gamma baby you don't know how lucky you are to be a New Zealander-land.</p>

                                <p>You have teachers who say they aren't comfortable teaching reading writing or arithmetic.  If they were comfortable or confident in these things they wouldn't be primary teachers.  Sometimes they say that.  But the ones with tenured positions have how many paid employment weeks per year where they are not having to front up to kids in the class?   I mean to say they are paid a yearly salary so they have a lot of time that is teaching recess so they can brush up on their reading writing and arithmetic skills.  But they won't.  And the ones who would make that kind or sort of use with that time are kept on temporary contracts where they are only paid during teaching weeks to do teaching weeks.  People on term contracts or whatever.  Who aren't paid over the teaching recesses.  To ensure they keep the basic standard of teaching low etc.  So the people with all the money and power can feel like they are the most meritous.  Justified.  Entitled.</p>

                                <p>National does not want the kids to do reading writing or arithmetic any more than there is no alternative Labor does.  They don't want people understanding any more math than that they are to be held or kept in negative numbers paying their employer having more and more and more levels of debt recorded against their name only.  They don't want people reading the statutes and reading the judges the law.  There is nothing actually here, at all.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                                <p>International community acknowledges the Prime Minister of NZ as the leader of an independent country.  But it is in the Australian Constitution that NZ is a State of Australia.  Australia denies people born in NZ Australian Birth Certificates and Passports.  Denies them access to certain training courses by way of denying them HECS.  Refuses to process applications for certain Government Jobs.  Keeps NZers as second or third class Australaians, effectively.  THe Government knows what is required to change or alter the constittuion.  A vote.  But NZers are denied voting papers.  There was no vote that NZers participated in to be removed from the Ausralian Federation.  To be soverign.  New Zealanders are denied Australian wages.  Are kept imprisoned in NZ, effectively.  Denied Australian currency with it's exhange rate or value or whatever.  Australaian Payroll systems, apparently, were responsible for NZ teachers not even being paid NZ wages.  They refused to accept that they graduated from their teaching qualifications in order to get students passing themselves off as or pretending to be teachers on payroll while they only continued to record more and more levels of debt against their name for having them enrolled with NZ Universities. </p>

                                <p>NZ thinks that just so long as we can point to things being worse in Ukraine there is no alternative to the way things are kept in NZ.  I don't know how or why or what...  Jacinda taking her infant child with her to the UN.  Helen Clarke had to go along to meetings of the UN regularly and explain how NZ had such really terrible rates of child abuse and suicide and so on.  Domestic violence.  We don't know how lucky we are to be kept detained held in NZ.  Paying and paying and paying and paying and handing over all of our work for no credit or acnkowledgement or recogition or payment.  Instead needing to write to the government for help with a disabiltiy clothing allowance etc because clearly it's a special need to actually have clothes.</p>

                                <p>Garbage dump of a wasteland.  For how many years am I supposed to give you coherent research while you treat me like garbage?  Where is my f*cking credit?  Oh.  Over various people's dead bodies.  The same ones calling for a draft so that not-them can be sent off to it.  Conveniently enough.  It should not be up to them to voluntarily stand down.</p>

                                <p>The courts have been starting to report hearings or outcomes of hearings of people being not allowed to practice medicine or law anymore because of various things that they have done that the public find unacceptable.  The thing is that they are mostly going after people who have turned 65 already.  So people who aren't supposed to be in the jobs anyway because they are supposed to have retired.  And then the judges say that they aren't supposed to be registered anymore.  As the outcome of the case.  Only if you look into the situation I think that you do find them actually still on payroll a couple years later when they are 67 or whatever.  I mean, they intentionally moved Dr Leeks to Melbourne to further enable him to commit crimes against the people after there was a bit of a public outcry.  They wanted to continue to enable him.  He was most highly valued employee.  Of course I'm sure he likely did not sign off on many people as having completed the requirements for Medicine etc.  So that he could be the only game in town.  There was no alternative to him and the way he wanted to manage or keep various people.  Disabled.  Incapacitated.  Taken out.  So that certain other people including himself could claim to be most meritous.  Only game in town.</p>

                                <p>The government isn't processing applications.  Frictional unemployment is only supposed to be up to 6 months but that is not what is going on.  People are kept unemployed for more than 1 year.  They throw the applications away so that certain people are the only game in town. Often they actually simply refuse to employ anybody into the postion at all. Throw away all the applications.  Keep the position unoccupied.  They don't want to pay people to work certain jobs. And they want to keep various people under-paid.  Slaving.  Slaves.</p>

                                <p>What's that?  I don't do enough work.  Really.  All the filings I've done for the courts.  All the research I've done for the Univerisites.  More than the people on payroll.  You are right.  I've done no work.  Because they don't pay me.  They don't pay me.  They don't pay me.  They don't pay me.</p>

                                <p>But they pay you?  Let's hear all about all of the work that you do...</p>

                                <p>Here's the thing...  I don't have this need to be paid more than you.  But I should be paid too.  And they are not even trying to be fair.  There aren't any universities.  HOstages.  Slaves.  There doesn't appear to be a functioning judiciary.  The issue is bigger than NZ.  NZ is a State of Australia -- it is in the Australian constitution.  Australia redeployed Harlene Hayes from Otago to WA only after she refused to graduate quite a few of the medical cohort.  They were informed they could pass themselves off as junior doctors in the hospitals of NZ only if they agreed to keep paying the university for continued re-enrolment because they would not acknowledge they had done enough work to complete the internships the university sent them on.  Kim Sterelny was redeployed from Wellington to ANU.  Not sure what he did.  He never got my work out to external examiners.  I don't know how many people sent him research when he was the editor of a journal only for him to re-attribute authorship of the work and bully the actual author away.  E.g., not acknowledging research output of anybody who wasn't currently on payroll else to be kept dependent on him for research funding etc.  So that he could collect up most of the research funding and credit for the work for himself.  And his friends at Penn and Harvard.  So they can give it to their students or people on payroll there.</p>

                                <p>The thing is that some supervisors or advisors play such a heavy handed role in some of their studnets work that they effectively write the studnets work for them else replace it with work they have been given.  I mean to say that plagarism is a thing.  Not so much by undergrads (as they would have us  believe)  but from the top.  The most senior people.  Sterelny used to say that he didn't acknowledge work that anybody had done more than 5 years ago.  So that he refused to talk about his previous research.  So that he can delay publication until the student is bullied away then give it to someone else to claim credit for it.</p>

                                <p>Fiona McPhearson heard my talk on delusion when she was working (or finding work on) synasthesia.  She likely had access to my written work because I used to distribute it at conferences and the like.  The powerpoint presentations at least, maybe the actual write up.  THen she's publishing on synasthetisa and delusions.  While I don't get any credit at all for the work that I do.  Because apparently it is so garbage it won't even be sent out for external examination.</p>

                                <p>They are not being fair at all.  Not even trying to be.  Their whole attitude is 'and what are you going to do about it?  You and whose army'?  I tend to think that things are better overseas...  But I don't know.  The fact is that the USA acknowledged Jacinda Ardern as Prime Minister of the Country of NZ.  When it is in the Australian Constitution that NZ is a State of Australia so she's, effectively, a State Premier.  The US seems to be condoning Australia keeping NZers as second class citizens, or whatever, not paying Australian wages and so on.  Treating people as property.  Right?  I am the property of the NZ government?  Right?  All of the work for none of the pay?  THey just keep throwing away applications for employment.  After they have given all the paid positions to slavers there's nothing left.   </p>

                                <p>The jobs are all 'by invitation' you see.  They tell people to get theier CV's in etc 'just as a formality' and  so on.  I mean to say they aren't even trying to be fair.  How much am I supposed to respect them and be respectful of them when they don't show me basic courtesy?  </p>

                                <p>How many years did Dave Wall write doctoral research for ANU?  How many years of work did you take from him before he ends up in hospital in a coma (after being given glucose before vitamins)?  For how many years did the ANU simply not accept anything that he had to say?  How many years did Carl Brusse write doctoral research for ANU?  Wrote two different theses on two different topics, didn't he?  Who was given credit for the first one that he wrote?  Someone from Princeton, was it?  Then the second one was..  Given to him, was it?  He could have a plagarised one as Sterelny-clone else he could have no credit for completing a PhD at all.  For how many years did John Matthewson work on his PhD?  I think he was working for..  1 year?  Was it?  While he was in Wellington because he's done his 3 or 4 years for the ANU.  But he's still handing over research, right?  Because they aren't crediting him as having given them enough research for them to acknowedge that he'd done enough for a PhD.  Various other people...  Not getting the work out to external examiners for the student to have credit for the work that was done.  Giving it away.  Is Sterelny dead yet?  THey promised us a Stuart McCutcheon funeral then they shut up about it... </p>

                                <p>The idea seems to be that people from the US or UK or whaetever will come and take the 'skilled' jobs while NZ refuses to acknowledge any skills in the people in NZ.  I guess they had to hire Ashley Bloomfield as an academic becuase there simply wasn't anybody else with a PhD who applied.  They didn't go 'wink wink nudge nudge wanna earn a few hundred grand a year as Professor, Ashley?  All you have to do is take your students research, tell them it's garbage and they better live in your basement and keep giving you research and feed your cats and keep giving you research so you can fly around the world and get all the teenagers to give you research and you never actually have to give any of them their research qualifications.  NOt if you want to be most qualified, of course.  Just don't ever sign off on anybody else.'  Did anybody from the ANU actually have their research externally examined?  Anybody at all?</p>

                                <p>The courts won't pay the lawyers.  I mean to say, in a case where one party is substantively correct and the other is simply refusing to do what they are supposed to do, by law, the courts won't award the legal fees to be paid by the losing party to cover the costs of the winning parties lawyers.  So the winning party is always required to pay the lawyers.  So the winning party always loses, therefore.  Sterelny would say that it must always be costly to punish.  Otherwise people would start to punish, you see.  And that's not in the psychopaths interests, at all.  The courts won't award costs to the substantively correct party.  Otherwise, they say that the party was 'merely' or 'only' 'technically correct' and not 'substantively correct'.  So, for example, if Ms Roe is correct that the University of Auckland was acting Ultra Vires when they threw away her application to MBChB in 2019 and 2020 on grounds that they deemed her to  be 'ineligible' then she isn't substantively correct.  It isn't that the University is now required to process her application according to the criterion they published and declare her rank order score and whether or not her rank order score was high enough for them to be required to have offered her enrolment in MBChB.  Rather, since the courts are not going to award costs to Ms Roe, Ms Roe can only be found 'technically' and never 'substntively' correct.  They won't award costs to lawyers.  And Ms Roe is not a lawyer.  They don't acknowledge that Ms Roe has a law degree.  So she can't win costs.  Ms Roe can only lose therefore.  Just keep filing, Ms Roe.  Revise and resubmit your filings Ms Roe.  The Judges have unlimited discretion to change the substance of the case into something they would prefer to hear.  Just keep refiling your refiling of the refiling of the refilings Ms Roe.  Oh, and by the way, don't forget to pay the courts, Ms Roe.  Pay the courts Ms Roe.  Pay the courts.  Don't forget that whoever was wronged needs to pay teh courts.  Otherwise the psychopaths wouldn't prevail.  We need to appreciate that the law, in NZ does have teeth.  Look at the teeth that it shows.  That is the problem.  THe prevention and prohibition of social development.  The proliferation of injustice.  Moving the offenders around to enable their continued offenses.  Land of criminal degenerates, apparently.  Artificially select arbitrarily some to be prison guards and some to be imprisoned.  Stanford Prison Experiment-land.  All the research to be done in the socially engineered environment.  What's that, Sterelny?  Not allowed to be behaviorally modern. </p>

                                <p>The University of Waikato didn't want to have a Medical School.  They just wanted to get more and more money for keeping students enrolled in a Medical Programme.  Then it would have them passing themselves off as Medical Doctors while paying the University.  Only to be replaced by new students passing themselves off while paying the University.  That's it.  That is the end game.  Then a bunch of people (an ever shrinking minority of people) collecting up more and more and more money for the keeping of slaves.  That is the end game.  Apparently.  Until the inevitable war.  I guess.  Population cull.  When it's time to pay the workers.  Nasty.  Nothing there.  All of the money for the government for the provision of none of the social services.  Not paying the doctors, teachers etc.  Not collecting the tax money that is there.  Not even trying.  Not paying the ambulance workers.  Not paying the police?  Likely...  They make their money traffickign drugs and the like, don't they? Working with the criminals who take the drugs from the hospitals and redistribute them through communities to placate the slaves.  That's the basic ideology?  Feel better.  It's only temporary.  Then they'll replace you with a new model.  One who is prettier.  Will do anything anything anything.  All of the work for none of the pay.  It's soooooo competitive.  Only pay you over their dead bodies, apparently.  No health system, therefore.  The volunteers will get them in the end.  Nasty bruitish and short.  There's nothing here. </p>

                                <p>So, uh, yeah.  Uh.  Invest in your education, everybody.  Take out more than $100,000 of student loans from the NZ government as an investment in your future earning potential!  So they can take and take and take and take and take all your work and pay you comparably to people who dropped out of school with no reading or writing at all.  Pay you comparably to people fresh out of prison.  So you can live amongst the bangy thumpy noisy people with little to no reading and writing at all.  Just f*cking die then.  Hand over your work to us and f*cking die, then.  It's sooooooo competitive..  Oh.  I can't even read and write, didn't you know.  Word salad.  That's me.  Just garbage out.  To be detained in a government institution so that my work can be handed to other people (people already on payroll) for them to take credit for it.  Or so that it can be handed to people on government payroll for them to reinterpret my work with their own spin (e.g, what happened with the report on disability and health).  Garbage f*cking output land, alright.  Not even trying to be fair.  Judges reappointed out of their retirement (that is to say judges that were not appointed via proper process at all) say that it's fine for NZ Universities to record students as being enrolled (and subsequently failed) for programmes of study that they never even applied to be enrolled in.  For that to be charged to their student loan.  Yeah, there's something wrong with my maths, alright.  I never never allowed to rise above those financial negative numbers.  So that Justice Toogood can take the judgments written by his..  Unacknowledged interns, was it?  How is it that they still acknowledge the Judges Law Degrees when they rule that University of Auckland is allowed to disregard qualifications received more than 5 years ago (even when people are left with tens or hundreds of thousands of debt still paying off the garbage qualifications that NZ Universities, even, won't acknowledge).  Garbage f*cking dump of a garbage f*cking wasteland.  Hostages to the f*ckign psychopaths.  There's nothing here.  The only leaders that international community would acknoweldge for NZ.</p>

                                <p>And make sure you phone one of those numbers to ask for help with your mental health, everybody.  Make sure the government records you as a vulnerable target to  be suicided all voluntary-like.  To be voluntarily detained in conditions of torture in a government institution.  To be lorded over by the Harvard Grads who wanted to go someplace long arm of the law indeed.  Only people who applied to work jobs where they paid the universities in exhange for getting to pass themselves off as medical doctors and do anything anything anything at all.  The NZ Courts refuse to extradite kim.com so that he can stand trial in the USA.  Or the USA refuses to allow NZ to have a functioning judiciary.  Refuses to allow NZ to extradite kim.com for him to stand trial.  He's being detained in NZ without a trail, you see.  THe prison camp detention land.  Say the only leaders acknowledged by international community for the prison state of NZL.</p>
