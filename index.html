                                <p> My understanding is that the courts did not consider the question of whether the infant needs surgery (what options there may be and what risks may be involved with the different options).  The parents and courts all assumed that there was 'my way or the highway' with respect to what the surgeon / surgical team / hospital staff were saying and the highway involved the likely death in the near future for the infant.  The only optionw was open heart surgery apparently (not a balloon catheter) and the open heart surgery was likely to require blood products.  Nobody questioned those things.  Nobody questioned how or why the baby had a defective valve in the first place. Or whether the baby in fact had a defective valve at all.  That is important with respect to competency of the party that the courts wanted to grant custody to.  For example, if it turns out that they didn't even have a radiology report on the state of the heart and whether that kind of condition rights itself as the kid grows or not...  If they didn't even have secure imaging to show that there was the problem that they say that there is...  If they don't even have accurate records about the child.  If the condition was caused by (for example) giving the mother steroids to induce premature delivery so they could keep it in a Fisher and Paykal incubator in conditions that has a tendancy to result in enlarged heart size and various problems..  Then the competency of the surgical team / hospital staff would be in question.  It would be good to hear some expert witness or testimony from clinically trained people from overseas about best practice in circumstances such as these.  About whether the open heart surgery is the only option, whether blood products are even needed, whether there is reason to believe the kid has stenosis, whether there is reason to believe that operations are needed.  And, of course, a good review of precisely what it is that they are doing to the kid when the kid is institutionalised into their custody.  The decisions they are making on behalf of the parents about various aspects of care that tehy believe they are entitled to make following on from the court order.  Whether they are keeping the parents properly informed of the reasons why they are choosing to do things their way (what other liberties they are taking), I mean to say...  </p>

                                <p>They should just close down Medicine in Auckland and Otago and merge it with Veterenary Science at Massey.  Let's be honest.  And let's be clear about vet.  Nobody will pay you to look after their pets.  You get paid to arficially inseminate cows for the milk production industry.  You get paid to figure less humane ways to fatten them up for slaughter.  You get paid to dope race dogs and horses before they get sent off to the Professor Glue Factory.  You get paid to phophylactically supply anti-biotics for mastitus in cows (bacteria in the milk will actually increase it's protein content) and to the chickens so they don't get all infected rollling about in their own shit in their free range conditions.  Do those things sound like fun?  Medicine might be for you.  You can help the government manage the herds of people till it's time for the people to go away.  Make sure the people get their shots.  Cry cry cry cry cry for MORE MONEY from the government for the people slaves.  MORE MONEY.  MORE MONEY.  MORE MONEY.  MORE MONEY TO THE UNIVERSITY FOR THE KEEPING OF SLAVES. MORE MONEY TO THE HOSPITALS FOR THE KEEPING OF SLAVES.  MORE MONEY.  MORE MONEY..  MORE MONEY.  Gee, I hope that NZ didn't try and supply 'skilled labor' to Samoa..  THey only contributed empty shipping containers (and expired vaccines -- right) ...  Right?  Best case.  They only contributed empty shipping containers.  What's that?  Oh. It's sooo competitive.  You lose.  We win.  What do we win?  The how low can we go competition.  Yeah, right.</p>

                                <p>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/politics/pm-jacinda-ardern-fronts-post-cabinet-immigration-announcement-expected-miq-ombudsman-report/R2Z5SQEGJVC7FJYW2MRMTX3DVI/  All the people who we refuse to graduate.  We refuse to graduate.  We refuse to enrol, progress through qualifications, we refuse to graduate.  All of the graduates from off-shore who they refuse to graduate..  Apply to here.  Pay us money pay us money pay us money ka toua.  Pay us money.  Never stop paying us money while we refuse to graduate.  We refuse to acknowledge your graduation.  We refuse to acknowledge your skills.  Don't get sick Jacinda!! DOn't get sick now, ya hear?  What's that..  You needed your wisdom teeth removed and thought that was an opportunune time to promise dentistry for us all.  And then you recovered from the anasthetic (one way of putting it) and go back to refusing to enrol, refusing to train, refusing to graduate.  Refusing to publically advertise positions.  Refusing to hire.  Refusing to pay.  Nothing to see here.  Hey, pay us money to apply to immigrate.  We are sooooooo cmopetitive.  Never stop paying us money.  Never stop paying us money.  Never stop paying us money.  Dont' get sick now, ya hear. </p>

                                <p>https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2022/12/asthmatic-3yo-dies-after-health-staff-fail-to-give-her-oxygen-overdose-her-with-adrenaline.html  C'mon now, they never would have paid him money to work that job if he hdn't have agreed to exerminate as many people as possible with his paid position by the Government.  Only graduate the incompetent.  What's so hard to understand about that?  Most competitive medical graduate workforece in the world.  Literally falling over each other to kill the most-eset.  Not going to process applications to enrol by anybdoy else.  Dr Leeks 2.0 wanna bees only need apply.  Can I help you?  Can I help you?  Can I help myself to you?  Never stop never stop never stop giving us money.  Half  a millino for the CE of the DHB to pretend to be too f*cking stupid to process the applicatons to work with the DHB.  Too f*cking stupid.  Application process no work-y no more.  Duuuuuh.  All the students will pay the university (the 'university') to work that job for free.  How much money can we get for stealing their organs etc?  NEver stop paying never stop paying never stop paying it's sooooo competitive.  Soooo competitive.  Only the best and the brighteset.  Only the richest.  Only those taking the most-est money.  Never stop giving them money never stop giving tehm money.  THey only wnt to help people.  Good to know what 'helping people' looks like.  Helping themselves to people.  I think some vets treat some animals better...  Just hand it over to vet science already.  At least they give the battery chickens timely antibiotics.  No rheumatic fever in the battery chickens.  Their lives are worth more.  Go figure.</p>

                                <p>See..  The New Zealanders watch Shortland Street and pay the Universities tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars (investing in their education it's called) to train how to be nurses and doctors and midwives and the like.  And then when it's time to graduate them from their qualification and pay them for the work the government refuses to graduate them.  Simply withholds their qualifications.  Relies on immigrants to pay the government to submit visa applications.  Then they say tehy will employ graduates of foreign training programmes.  And then once they've invested so much money and time and effort they say that they won't acknowledge their foreign qualifications and they can pay the universities in NZ for a new education and traiing programme.  Which they have no intention of ever saying they have garduated from.  Rather, they work the job but their salary is diverted to the university because they pay the university they pay the university they pay the univesrity until they die.</p>

                                <p>So..  Let's  be honest.  No doctors.  NO lawyers.  NO nurses.  NO teachers.  There's nothing.  Actually and truly.  The Governmetn who faile dto process applicatons to enrol, failed to acknowledge progressions through trianing, failed to employ people willing and able to work that job (of training the new generation), faile dto garduate the new generation.  Faile dto publically advertise jobs.  Failed to engage in fair selection process.  Cry cry cry cry cried for immigrant slaves to come here and pay the universities pay teh 'universities' pay the 'universities' for refusing to employ anybody willing and able to train tehm.  What a scummy scam of a garbage land at the arse end of the world.  No self preservation instict.  Nothing to see here.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  Nada zip zilch zero.</p>
