 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                            <p>How long are you supposed to work full time on a 120 point research project before it goes out for external examination?  How about a 360 point one?  For it to be sent out with instructions for external examiners to examine it with respect to acceptability for the programme the student applied to be working on, and the one they had been working on, I mean to say.  How many decades are you supposed to hand over research to NZ Universities so they can re-atribute authorship to someone else or give your research away or attempt to bury it if they do not like what you have to say? </p> 

                            <p>MA.  The University of Waikato kept me enrolled for 2 academic years and 1 summer school period.  It was a 120 point 1 year research qualification only.  They did not tell me that I was expected to hand it in until near the end of the second academic year, however.  That means they forced me to be enrolled with part time status only.  Less than 120 points per year.</p>

                            <p>PhD.  The Australian National University had me as a summer scholar.  They accepted my work well enough for them to give me a Government Scholarship to do a PhD.  They never got my PhD work out to external examiners so that it could  be externally examined on the basis of it's academic merits.  You can see various articles / seminars I wrote during my candidature on the writing page.  A document more than 100,000 words long that was never sent out to externals.  Subsequent documents that were handed to my supervisor that were never sent out for externals, again.  They aren't allowing studnets to complete the programme of study.   </p>

                            <p>I don't know what other studnets did that meant that they got their work out to externals in a timely fashion.  Did they?  Or did they just tell them that the student had done enough.  I don't know how many students were expected to write two PhD's effectively, to get credit for only one.  Etc.  I don't know how many studnets had their thesis effectively given to them or written for them by their supervisor or someone else in this manner.</p>

                            <p>The University's of Auckland and Otago are not properly procesing applications to Medicine.  They throw applications away without considering them on their academic merits.  Little wonder that we don't have any doctors etc.  They won't graduate Medical Students or acknowledge that they have completed their training.  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camps.  They aren't even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                            <p>The Governments are not being fair in their hiring decisions.  They aren't publically advertising jobs, they aren't considering applicants on the basis of their merits. They shoulder tap particular people and tell them to get them a CV as a mere formality.  But they have already decided who is going to be given the payroll.  They are not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                            <p>The courts do not function.  I suppose because they won't graduate lawyers.  But even if they did the courts won't award them legal fees or costs.  They shoulder tap retired judges wanting to re-appoint them to office instead of engaging in a fair process of selection of new judges.  Corruption.  The lengths they go to to ensure the under-developed state of New Zealand stays under-developed.  So that the criminals and offenders of the world can be lured here and then kept here and nobody will do anyting about how badly they are treated here.  Slave camp detention facility by design.  Punative only.  They don't want people to be reading writing or doing arithmetic.  They want happy slaves doing the slave work for no pay.  While various people like Ashley Bloomfield get paid more several hundred thousand dollars per year to play Professor, apparently, when he never applied to PhD or MD, never did the research work for one etc.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>
