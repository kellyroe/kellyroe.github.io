                            <p> https://www.nzherald.co.nz/kahu/the-investment-into-maori-apprentices-has-turned-around-maori-unemployment-youre-hired/4NEY2WL5RNAQ5KJ2OSEYM7IZGE/  Do the apprentices get paid minimun wage for every week of their apprenticeship?  Or do the 'apprentices' have levels of debt recorded against their name, with the Inland Revenue Department?  The Government is paying the training provider to keep them as hostages.  Prisoners.  Detainees.  Slaves.  They aren't paid minimum wage for the work that they do -- are they?  Are they paid minimum wage?  How many decades are they supposed to do their 'apprenticeship'  before they are graduated from their qualifications so that they can go into their minimum wage paying jobs?  What education and training system?  You don't pay the workers.  You pay the slavers to keep slaves.  How are they unemployed when they don't make minimum wage for the work that they do?  What workforce? What economy?  </p>

                            <p>Helen Nicolson announced that she understood the concerns of her staff and that she and anybody earning over $100,000 per annum would be exercising pay restraint and that the retirement age would be enforced.  SOme people had had government payroll for 40+ years.  If they still couldn't function in the private sector no more government payroll for them.  Time to retire.  Stand down ffs.  No.  She didn't.  She says she doesn't get enough for each hostage for her to pass on to each hostage so much as a minimum wage.  What education and training programme?    What University?  How many graduate research students are acknowledged as having completed 120 points of study in 1 year?  How many 360 point graduate research students are acknowledged as having completed 360 points of study in 3 years?  What law grads? What medicine grads?  What engineering grads? What skilled workers?  What University?  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camp. It's sooooo competitive. Only over Helen's dead  body. </p>
