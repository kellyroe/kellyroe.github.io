                <p>The above was supplied to my supervisor and the table of contents (together with a chapter word count totaling more than 100,000 words) was supplied to the ANU administration at a point in time when they had me enrolled in the PhD programme.  I still don't have reports from external examiners and haven't received any notification as to when the oral examination is going to be held.  </p>

                <p>University of Auckland employees who were payrolled to give studnets course advice advised me to complete a new qualification from a NZ University for purposes of `eligibility' for MBChB. 
                </p>

                <p>Australians were applying to Australian post-graduate entry Medical Programmes.  But I was told I wasn't an Australian citizen so I wasn't eligible for Australian Government loans.  So I'd have to apply to Auckland or Otago to do Medicine.  Whereas the Australians could apply to both Australia and New Zealand and take government loans from either country.  Otago trains Australians treating them as domestic with their fees etc.  Australia picks and chooses when it treats NZers as domestic.  Second or third class Australians.</p>


                <p>
                Since Auckland advised me that I needed to complete a new qualification from a NZ University in order to be `eligible' to be enrolled in MBChB I applied to be enrolled in a 120 point 1 EFT MPhil with the Univesrity of Waikato starting 05 March 2018.  I supplied them with a under 50,000 words MPhil thesis document on 14 September, 2018.</p>

                <p>They never sent it out for external examination.  Never.  They told me to keep working and REFUSED to send it out. </p>

                <p>I supplied a thesis 05 October 2018 and they sent the under 50,00 word masters thesis out for external examination requesting external write `doctoral reports' of it.  They sent it out to be examined for a qualification I wasn't enrolled in.  They sent it out with instructions for externals to examine it for the wrong qualification.  </p>

                <p>Of course the externals say that in order for the thesis they had been sent to be acceptable as a doctoral thesis it would need changes to the substance.  It would need to be about doubled in length, in fact.  See, I gave them a 120 point 1 EFT MPhil thesis that was required to be under 50,000 words and they were asked to examine it with respect for acceptability as a `doctoral thesis' where a `doctoral thesis' is a 3-4 year project with a minimum enrolment of 2 years.  I'd only been working on it about 6 months (to allow up to 3 months external examination to be completed in the 34 weeks or 9 months of enrolment that the TEC says is to be associated with a 120 point 1 EFT Programme of study).</p>

                <p>I supplied them a substantively updated  thesis 24 February 2019.  It had been substantively updated in response to the `doctoral reports' I received from examiners in December.  But I was limited in what I could do because it was required to be under 50,000 words rather than closer to 100,000 words and it was a 1 EFT project and not a 3 or 4 EFT project.
                </p>

                <p>

                  The Dean instructed me to write a commentary or something to accompany my changes.  I guess they just keep on making up requirements (sorry `requirements') as they go along.  I do what she says (I'm doing everything they say - even when they are asking me to do things that they have no right to demand of me).  She refuses to get the substantively updated thesis to externals.  She refuses to get the commentary of changes to externals.
                    
                </p>

                <p>Stuart McCutcheon and Dawn Freshwater were both sent my thesis and the evidence that I completed a 120 point MPhil (by making the substantive changes the external examiners required within 10 weeks of my recieving their reports).  I supplied the evidence that I'd `done enough' for eligibility for MBChB.  Even when the education and training act says I'm eligible in fact in virtue of my being a domestic adult who has attained the age of 20 years.  Have I done enough yet for them to enter my GPA into their selection algorithm and offer me enrolment in MBChB if and only if my rank order score is high enough for offer of place?  They had a published algorithm as to how they would calculate GPA.  Best 120 points of the last 2 years of graded full time study towards completed qualifications including summer school papers above stage one.  Since the MPhil was ungraded (it was pass or fail only - like a PhD is) my grades would come from my previous study they said.  The MPhil was only for `eligibility'.  Even though the Education and Training Act declares me to be eligible. </p>

                <p>The `University' never sent the commentary and never sent the substantively updated thesis out to the externals so that they could sign off on the subtantive changes within 10 weeks.  The Uni calendar regulations say that when substantive changes are indicated to be required by the examiners then there are two different ways in which they are to be done.  Firstly, if the externals return the thesis to the candidate (which the externals did not) then the student is to be re-enrolled for 6 more months before another 3 month external exam.  So, repeat the year on a 120 point 1 EFT programme.  Do the whole thing over again.  Else, if they don't return the thesis to the canadidate (both of htem refused to return it to me even when the Uni asked them to do this) then the studnet has up to 10 weeks to make the changes the externals required.  I made the changes within 10 weeks as the externals indicated to me (by them not returnign the thesis to me) and the University refused to get the changes I made to externals to ALLOW externals to sign off on accepting the 120 point 1 EFT MPhil within 1 calendar year.  A University academic year is 34 weeks or 9 months including the external exam period.  So says the TEC which the Uni si required to listen to if they want to invoice studnet loans.  </p>

                <p>Prison camp.  There's nothing there.</p>

                <p>They re-enrol me for more fees for a programme I never applied to be enrolled in.  They kept me enrolled under `zero fee scheme' which was only for first year students.  Not for graduate students. </p>

                <p>Australasia does not have an education and training system.  STanford prison experiment.  Pick people arbitrarily or at random and assign or deploy them into position.  Ashley Bloomfield never applied to be enrolled in MD or PhD he has no research output he never wrote a thesis he is supposed to be professor, now?  Jacinda will write a book one day?  So she gets 3 fellowships she never applied for and she also never applied for PhD did not do the work for one and she never handed in a thesis and she has no research output.  What education and training system?  There's nothign there. </p>

                <p>Apparently Harvard can re-deploy Jacinda Ardern into position as Professor when she never applied to do PhD, never did the work for one, doesn't have a research output, didn't have her work externally examined, didn't have an oral defence.  She's indistinguishable from a doctoral or PhD graduate!  She was the best hire they do!  She was the most qualified!  For everything it was that they valued.  She's a real academic.  </p>

                <p>Well, that totally makes sense.  What education and training system?  What universities?  They won't enrol students in programmes they have applied for on the basis of their academic merits.  They won't objectively blind grade academic merits.  They won't get work out for external examination.  They won't allow external examiners to sign off on qualification completions.  THey won't hire people with qualifications for employment.  They are going to staff the `Universities' with secondary teachers or politicians, now, and the `secondary schools' with primary school teachers (up to the end of intermediate school are primary trained).  They will stock them with people who have been bullied and abused for any number of years in the prisons, one can only suppose, in the name of 3rd and 4th and infinite chances for the pedophiles.</p>

                <p>Dr Leeks and Professor Glue etc etc etc are the only game in town.  Everybody else's application was thrown away and people really went out of their way to deploy and re-deploy them into position so they could keep as many victims as poorly as possible for quite a few years there.  See what it is that they value.  All the `medical research' that involves keeping however many people in controlled populatiosn observing their sicknesses and diseases inflicted upon them in the name of helpling prevent worse atrocites.  All the people with maleria or cancers or whatever.  In the  name of medical science research.  You have been consented.  You have been volunteered.  For the death camps.  What part of that is hard to understand?</p>

                <p>Do you think Hitler thought he was a `game changer'?  Do you think he would have been democratically elected if he hadn't have depoloyed various people into position to manage the death camps?  </p>

                <p>Look at the people they choose to payroll.  Never applied to the programeems of study.  Never did the work for them.  Never had their work externally examined.  Never gave public oral defences.  How come they were deployed into position, then?  I guess they managed to murder everybody else off so they were the only game in town. It's so hostile and so competitive - right Sterelny?  More and more and more and more and more money for you, then.  So you can take from some and reattribute authorship to people who you like to eat your lunch with.  People who can pretend to enjoy going away with you on camping trips etc.  What education and training system?  There's nothing there.</p>

                <p>The death camps of Australasia.  There is nothing there.</p>

                <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/505389/security-at-hospitals-emergency-departments-get-5-point-7-million-funding-boost-over-summer  They'll have to start a Degree programme.  A several decade long double degree qualification in transportation safety officer, or similar, where they pay and pay and pay and pay and pay to be placed into their internship positions where their job is to send away anyone who presents to the `hospitals'.  That is how to get the `reducation in wait room times'.  Just euthanise anyone who presents.  All voluntary-like.  The volunteers.  Also those who claim that it's time for them to be paid.  Wow.  Best health system in upside down and back to front land ever!  I see why people will volunteer all voluntary like from all around the world to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay to come here.  Australasia.  Most desirable location in upside down and back to front land ever!  Pay and pay and pay and pay to come here!  Never stop paying!  Never stop paying for the goverments crimes so they can take all the money all the titles all the employment positions...  Judith Collins is a KC, now?  Is that for all the work that she did for government prosecution?  Taking the cases that nobody else was allowed to...  Yeah, right.  So the terrorist who shall not be named died in state care all voluntary-like when it was about time for the police to present the courts with the evidnece that they fed and watered him and supplied him with qualified and paid lawyer before he signed the confession all voluntary like.  He was volunteered.  Clearly.  To die in state care. Not even trying to be fair, hey.  There is nothing here. </p>

                <p>Look at the choices they make.  Hey. The question burning on everybodies mind is how they could possibly go lower and how they could possible do any worse.  How can we comprehend how they could possibly do any worse.  I mean...  Is it that they are so f*ckign crap and doing good or that they are so f*cking good at doing crap?  Well what is the general spirit?  Self congradulatory?  In fact?  Hey, didn't have reports from external examiners.  Didn't have an oral defence.  Was appointed into postion to do what now?  Yeah, you made it.  And various people were volunteered to be victims so you could be paid and paid and paid and paid and paid to steal their work and pass it off as your own.  To throw their work away.  Nobody would voluntarily choose to work with you.  But who cares, right?  That's why they pay you.  They pay you they pay you they pay you to take the kiddies away on camping trips.  They pay and they pay and they pay and they pay you.  Why, again?  To manage the death extermination camps.  Good job!  Yay you!  You made it!  Everything that you ever wanted!!! All the kiddies doing anything anything anything anything to come to school to eat their lunch with you.  Yeah, right.  You made it!  Yay you!!! congrats!!! There's nothing there.  Hey.  When did you get reports from external examiners?  Why didn't I see your publically advertised oral defence?  Why do they pay you and they don't pay me?  F*cking psychopaths.  Yay you!  You made it!!  Congrats!!! good job!!! yay you!!!! off to the death camps for everyone else!  You made it!  You made it! Is it everythign you wanted it to be!!! THey go away with you on camping trips!!  They do anything anything anything everything!!! It's sooooooo competitive!!!! THey pay you!!!! Congrats!!!!!  Good job!!!! yay you!!! You made it!!!! Woooooooooooo!!!!!!!</p>

                <p>All the under 20 year olds being re re re re re enrolled in `university qualifications' for decades....  Being held under conditions of.   Uh...  Of uh... They won't get their work to externals.  They won't schedule oral defences.  Most of hte first year studnets do more work in one academic year than various who claim to have payroll.  Then documetation of how they keep their murder death camps.  Important scientific research watching people die their untimely deaths in conditions of tortue.  There is nothing there in fact.  There is nothing there.  The wrong people won the war in Australasia because the atrocities never stopped.  There is nothing here.</p>

                <p>Various things (shall we call them)  arrived in Australaisa and looked into the mirror and didn't see any people . Terra nullus.  They couldn't see any people.  There isn't any people there.</p>

                <p>You know.  So that we can understand the various forces that go into various things.  No education.  No health.  No judiciary.  Just deploying non-people into position to exerminate the people as vermin.  They would  never have been apointed any other way.  Not by any kind of external examination process. That was precisely why there wasn't one.  The best and the brightest!  Where they go to be exterminated.  Annihiliated.  Off to the death camps.  There isn't anything there.  The ones you paid and paid and paid and paid (where are their reports?  When were their publically scheduled oral defences?) they would have things no other way.  Well then, off to the death camps for everyone else.  There isn't anything there.  There is nothing there.  There isn't an educationa nd training system.  Death camp.  Extermination system.  There isn't anything there.  They won't pay people to work in an educationa nd training system.  Tehy won't have an education system.  There isn't anything there.</p>

                <p>The office of the ombudsman, the privacy commission...  They are supposedly NGO's.  Then all of the government departments...  They won't hire the most qualified person for the postion.  They won't even do an interview.  They won't do interviews.  Not for any appointment of any position.  From senior to junior to 3 year temp to 2 year temp to 1 year temp they won't pay the workers.  They wont' have interviews.  They aren't hiring.  They won't hire the most qualified person for the postion.  Have I done enoguh for a 1 year hire???  Oooooooh it' ssoooooooo scary!!!! my work history is soooooo patchy we don't know if I can do 1 year of work in 1 year!!!! ooooooh!!!! So who did they hire for that one, then?  The 16 year old child of the adminstrator?</p>

                <p>There is nothing there.  There isnt' anything there.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                <p>Sign up all voluntary - like for your non-voluntary training programmes everyone!  They record increasing levels of debt against you name only and won't get your work to externals and will graduate you never.  Will hire their own in-bred retareded children who never applied for anything never did the work for anything and never were interviewes etc etc.  I think probably what  happens is that Warwick Bagg (for example) gets sooooooooo old that his great great great granddaughter takes control of  his bank account and applies for a sex change on her birth certificate so she can keep collecting on his payroll.  Can't even won't even calculate a GPA according to the published selection criterion.  And he's supposed to to be involved with a medical school, he's supposed to be involved in statistical trials? What a f*cking farce of a f*cking hoax of a f*cking scam.  Nobody would voluntarily apply to be enrolled with a f*cking idiot institution.  NOt voluntarily . There's no f*cking way.</p>

                <p>Idiot institution can't even won't even process an application to enrol.  Can't even won't even process graduations.  F*cking most idiot instituiton of Australasia does not have volunteers.  There aren't any people here.  Terra Nullus.  There's nobody home ffs.  Can't even won't even do the job that apparently some of them are paid.  Yeah, f*cking right.  There's nothing here.</p>
