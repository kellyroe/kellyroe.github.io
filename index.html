    <p>When people don't have the power to say 'no' they also don't have the power to say 'yes'.  That is to say, when the power to say 'no' goes away there is no meaningful 'yes'.  And...  The stupid thing about the whole situation...  Is that so very very very very very many people would choose 'yes'.  But they don't get to.  Because you force them to comply.  Because you will not uphold the 'no'.  WHich only reinforces that nobody actually has the power to say 'yes'.   P.S., don't forget to 'spread your legs' for New Zealand's covid response.  Wink wink nudge nudge Christopher Hipkins.  Whose you Mummy?  I mean, let's be clear...  We delay delay delay compensation until the people are dead.  Haha!  That was our objective, the purpose, the point, all along.  We win, you lose.  How else can we possibly get that through your thick skulls?  You can cry cry cry cry cry about how any compensation coming to you is only going to be used up in palliative care (never ever ever in investment in any kind of future) and still you likely won't get anything.  But, at least you understnd that you never ever ever get to invest in any kind of future.  By the time Chris Hipkins and his selfish genes have taken up everything that they think they are worth there's nothing left for anybody else.  The social hierarcy is clear.  Sacrosanct.  Spread your legs for Chris Hipkins else you have no future at all.  Consider yourself lucky if you are one of the chosen ones and he chooses to display himself in your direction.  That's what it is or means to be part of the nasty little despot this part of the world.  Evidence to the contrary?
        </p>

        <p>So, God talks to Jacinda.  And Jacinda tells Chris, and any reigning Judges, how it's gonna be.  And you do what they say when tehy say because you say.  Else it's time for you to go away.  In the name of being imprisoned for your crimes (since the judicary is a mechanism of abuse for the governmetn to use against the people where the likes of Brian Tamaki get imprisoned simply because people might vote for him whereas the pedophile bullies are revered and shipped around the world in their quarter million jobs for the government)...  Imprisoned in the name of psychiatry.  Pediatrics, even.  You name it.  The governmetn will tell you what to do (the only people on government payroll) and you comply else it's time for you to go away.  Keeping the social order, apparently.  What social order?  What social order is there, in NZ?  The dumb and dumber show.  Boo ya.  </p>

        <p>National blood service of NZ:  cry cry cry cry cry cry cry we don't have any money we dont have enough money.  What does it choose to do with the money that it has got?  Hire a KC to defend their decision to force people to invoice or bill for their services when people do not want their services.  The Judiciary says 'haha!  That's a lucrative scam that we want in on!!! All of the money for us! All of the money for us!! ALLL OF THE MONEY FOR US'.  How old is Justice Gault?  For my information.  Compulsory retirment age of judges (something factored into the decision bout what age they  hired certain judges at) was what?  And how old is he?  in relation to his conditions of acceptance as Judge of High Court, I mean to say?  For how many years has he taken up High Court Payroll?  For how many years has he had to train an heir in his place when he retires at his expected age of retirement?  Wherre is is special chosen child progeny to take his place?  Or did he eat them all?  </p>

        <p>Anyway...  The NZ blood service chooses to spend money forcing people to have treatment they don't want.  Meanwhile many many many people in NZ are saying 'we ask for help and ask for help and ask for help and are only ever turned away'.  Seems the health system thinkst hat the only people worth treating are those who play 'hard to get'.  Only treat the involuntary.  Only treat the non-voluntary.  Do all of your Medical experiments on people crying and begging nd pleading for you to stop.  Leavae them alone.  Go find other targets.  there is nothing here..</p>

        <p>So, the Medical profession swoops in to save x despite parental decison.  Are they going to pay for x to go to private high schools?  They going to pay his way through college?  They turning up to sports games on the weekend?  They paying the subscriptions and fees?  They just swooping in over the weekend to f*cking everyone they want and then walking away.  Maybe thinking they made a nice compliant cleaner for their own sons or whatever?  Don't forget to spread your legs for chris hipkins. You should be grateful . There is no alterntive.</p>

        <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/300492991/jail-term-reduced-for-man-who-tried-to-buy-girl-on-dark-web-under-username-kiwipedo  Does he get some help for what likely happened to him as a kid, yet?  I mean he couldn't be asking for help more blatantly.  Right?  What does it take for him to get the help he wants?  A court order?  But even with a court order will he get the helps he is clearly asking for?  ONLY TREAT THE INVOLUNTARY NON-VOLUNTARY.  ONLY 'TREAT' THEM FOR THEIR 'OWN GOOD' AGAINST THEIR WILL. There's no health resources left.  No help for the voluntary.  Not everybody can have the help they want / need.  ONLY TREAT THE NON-VOLUNTARY INVOLUNTARY.  By teh time the blood service has finished hiring a KC to ONLY TREAT THE INVOLUNTARY NON VOLUNTARY FOR THE WEEKEND AND HAND HIM BACK there isn't any thing left to treat the voluntary people begging and pleading for help.  8th kind of gaslighting.  Welcome.  </p>

        <p>Equality.  Yeah, alright.  Different people are different therefore different people are not equal.  Okay.  The fact that they are persons means they are equally worthy of equal consideration for or of their interests.  Or something like that.  That's what equality means.  In the respects that matter.  For moral consideration.  So that 'no means no' doesn't only apply when Chris Hipkins begs for mercy, it applies to his victims, also.  For example.  Maybe I should lay off that particular example.  It's not personal.  Anybody with that many portfolios would equally be a target.  See.  See how that works?  Anyway...  Do I mean to say that Hitler is of equal value or worth as Jacida?  As Jesus?  Etc?  Why yes.  I do.  Worthy of equal consideration of their equal interests.  Yes.  That doesn't mean they have unlimited right to do whatever they want whenever they want because they want and steamroller over the equal insterest of others.  Hitler can be as worthy as Jesus but also prevented and prohibited from achieving what his heart desires insofar as what his heart desires tramples all over the interests of others..  See?  See how that works?  So, then, we don't need to ban someone for saying that Hitler was worthy of equal consideration as Jesus.  That's not racist.  Anti-semitic.  It's not condoning of anything Hitler did or did not do.  It's just saying you beleive in equality. In the American Dream sense. Of people being equal.  Worthy of equal consideration of their intersts and all that.  Of course the interest that someone might have in genocidal extermination of another group of people is an interest that pales into insignificance compared to the interests that that group has in not being annihilated.. But that doesn't undermine or devalue Hitlers worth as a person...  And the Christchurch Terrorist is worth as much as everybody else...  HIs consequence of his crime (insofar as he is actually guilty) is to spend the rest of his life in government custody or detention.  Which is (and should be) a greater burder to the governmetn than his...  Assimilation?  Acclimitisation?  Assitance? Into being a productive memebr of NZ society ever would have been.  To make it more costly to the NZ government for not investing in it's people than the cost of their refusal to do so.  Comprehend.  Aye??  Of course they also have the death penalty in some circumstances or situations (controversially -- no change to the constitution would likely meet the threshold for changing that)...  I don't mean to say that they have it all worked out.  But many people do in fact think (with tehir money and their time and energy and effort) that it's an ideology that they would preferentially choose to adopt or accept if only they were allowed or able to immigrate..  So.. . It's strange for people who would sell out in a minute (so to speak) to disparage it...  Of course I could be wrong but I suspect they got hacked and a public service announcement was (unauthorised) proclaimed..  And they don't know how to take it back without losing face...  And maybe they weren't paying the intellectual property or copyright on using a certain musician's music anyway..  I suspect might be more along the lines of what may actually be going on.  Who does the amimations for Les Mill The Trip?  I have been wondering...  Who does that?  Is it a NZ team or group or company or whatever...  Or is it an overseas one?  Why no credits?  I mean seriously and legitimatly why no closing credits during cool-down or stretching at the end of the class?  There is ample time...</p>
