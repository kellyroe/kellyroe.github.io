                            <article>

                                <p>
                                The work that I had done in the Philosophy of Psychopathology was all  based on the assumption that we were trying to help people in ways they wanted to be helped rather than engaging in a process of harming people.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                So, for example, I was trying to extend work that had been done on delusions so as to help people with delusions not be delusional anymore.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                But if the aim or the point or the purpose is to unlawfully detain (in conditions of torture, even) as many people as you can...  Well, then, you can see a different function, entirely, for the diagnosing and 'treating' of delusions.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                New Zealand has been exposed to Psychiatry.  For example, Dr Melphi from the Sopranoes.  Dr Szasz: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Szasz. New Zealand has the idea of it.  Such that they present to GPs or the ED, asking for help from Psychiatry, specifically.  They invisage a combination of excluding medical problems, prescribing medication where appropriate, and monitoring the prescriptions in conjunction with regular psychotherapy.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                New Zealand does not appear to have Psychiatry.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I presented to the ED of the Auckland City Hospital seeking treatment for a physical complaint.  Previous injury has resulted in disfigured and numb toes.  I had been walking extensively during lock-down and ended up with nails coming off, bacterial infection, and I was concerned about possible hookworm infestation from walking barefoot in the Domain. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I presented to the ED rather than my GP because, at that time, the media was reporting that GPs did not have PPE and, at that point in time, the EDs were relatively empty.
                                </p>  

                                <p>
                                They mocked my concern about parasites.  They  placed an IV line in my arm and held me in a seclusion room under 'duty of care' for more than 12 hours.  There were extensive cords from medical equipment.  There was no natural light.  There was an LED that was strobing and medical equipment with regular intemittent beeps.  I was not allowed to phone the police or a lawyer.  These sorts of sensory deprivation conditions are likely to induce delusions in most people.   
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                They sectioned me for a 5 day observation hold under the Mental Health Act on grounds they believed me to be delusional.  They required me to take medication and there is no medication that was charted for me, at all.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                After 5 days they gave me a form saying I was to be kept under the Mental Health Act with 'voluntary' status.  They refused to allow me to leave and asserted that I was choosing to stay voluntarily in the hospital.  I was not.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The problem is not that there isn't enough resources for everybody who wants help to have help.  The problem is the bullying and abuse.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                They would rather treat me like that than train me to do Medicine.  They would be correct that I'm not exactly Dr Leeks 2.0 material.  I never did find Dr Leeks motivating or inspiring.  I never wanted to be like that or be like him.  I never wanted to train under people like that or like him.  That is not Psychiatry.  This is not a Health System.  They don't see the people presenting as people.  Cattle or lambs to the slaughter.  People survive in spite of our 'health system'.  Not because of it.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The Government does not honor the scope of inquiry that has been set by the UN in the Abuse into State Care inquiry.  It was to be limited in scope specifically so as to see the Government pay the Victims for the Crimes of the Government.  What happened was that the Government tried to expand the scope of the inquiry to make the proceedings unweildy to delay things.  Then what happened was that the Courts thought they would take the opportunity to make the Victims pay the Courts.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The Inquiry into University of Otago Medical Students paying money in exhange for internships to be signed off as complete without them having attended was set by New Zealand and Canberra. They restricted the scope to overseas internships so as not to find corruption within NZ.  They blamed the students for paying for sign off and they did not look at how the University won't sign off on completion of their Degree if they won't pay.  Even if they do pay the University doesn't seem to sign off on completion of their Degree.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                When the Auditor General looks at Universities he does not look at what theses have been accepted by the University (and the enrolment dates) and calibrate that with what they say about the enrolment EFTS and the number of studnets etc that the University claims to have enrolled in the corresponding period.  The Universities are fabricating Graduate Research numbers and holding a few studnets hostage / to ransom.  Not crediting them for the work that they do.  Trying to bully them into fleeing with no credit.
                                 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The Auditor General is now restriting the scope of inquiry with the DHB's to Children's Psychiatry, specifically.  They aren't looking at how many FTE Psychiatrists there are employed in the DHB's and who those people are.  I want to look into those people and see how many of them have been struck off overseas registers for atrocities.  How many of them haven't (yet) only because of some kind of asylum that seems to have been granted to them by the Courts of New Zealand since the Courts of New Zealand has decided, too, that they would like to abuse the people who Psychiatry has picked out to abuse, as well.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I didn't ask to  be born, here.  It is not fair that around 1/4 of our population is bullied into fleeing New Zealand (the idea is that if you have any brains at all then you will flee New Zealand if you know what is good for you).  What is fair is for the offenders to stand down.  If you aren't willing to work towards the development of New Zealand then you leave.  Get out of the way. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                First they came for the Jews.  And I did nothing.  Beacause I was not Jewish.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Then they came for the Maaori.  And I did nothing.  Because I was not Maaori.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Then they came for the most deprived.  And I did nothing.  Because I was not in the group of people they called most deprived.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Then they came for the disabled.  And I did nothing because they did not call me disabled.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Then they called me disabled and deprived.  In an attempt to make it be the case that there would be nobody to stand for me.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                It does not feel very nice to live in a country wondering when they will decide to come for you.  It isn't delusional.  It is realism.  It is the state of New Zealand.
                                </p>
