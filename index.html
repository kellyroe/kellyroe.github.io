                                There is a link to my CV that I have presently under consideration for various things.  I am in the transferring things into a new file format and merging smaller pieces into collections (so you can get a sense of my standard or normal work output per year).  I'll try not to break the above links in my CV in the process.

                             Not sure what date to put on that.  2010?  2011?  2012?  My ANU file notes show that I supplied the administration with evidence that I had a document of the requisite length to go out to external examiners at a time when I was enrolled as a doctoral candidate for the ANU.  How many years are you supposed to hand over research outputs before they get that work out for external examination?  3 years extendible to 4.  They still haven't sent it out for external examination.  How can they claim to be a University?  I don't remember any of the students having publically scheduled oral defences.  There's nothing there. 
                            </p>

                            <p>I returned to NZ to do MBChB (Medicine).  They aren't properly processing the applications to enrol in that programme of study.  They won't do it.  They refuse to calculate my GPA properly.  They refuse to enrol candidates on the basis of the published selection criterion.  They instruct me to `keep working' on a new qualification for `the purposes of eligibility' when the Education and Trianing Act states that I am eligible because I have attained the age of 20 years and I applied to be enrolled in that qualification.  I wrote a 120 point MPhil thesis for Waikato here (the TEC says that's 34 weeks of enrolment including the external examination period):</p>

                            <p><a href="./publish/2018-rep-1.pdf">Disability and equity for medicine and public health</a></p>

                            <p>3 spiral bound copies of the above was shipped to the Dean of the Research School on 14 September 2018 for the purposes of external examination only.  The University NEVER sent the thesis out for external examination.</p>

                             <p><a href="./publish/2018-rep-2.pdf">Disability and equity for medicine and public health</a></p>

                             <p>3 spiral bound copies of the above was shipped to the Dean of the Research School on 05 October 2018 for the purposes of external examination for a 120 point 1 EFT MPhil thesis only.  The University sent it to externals with templates for them to write `doctoral reports'.  I don't know if they were paid to examine a masters thesis else if they were paid for writing doctoral reports.  Check the accounts.  My invoice from the `University' specifies 'payable by doctoral examination fee waiver'</p>

                             <p><a href="./publish/2019-rep-1.pdf">Disability and equity for medicine and public health</a></p>

                             <p>This was substantively updated in response to the `doctoral reports' within 10 weeks.  It was supplied to the University of Waikato to get back to the anonymous examiners so they could sign off on the qualification completion and it was also supplied to Stuart McCutcheon as evidence that I completed the 120 point MPhil in 2018.  The University never got this to externals.</p>

                              <p><a href="./publish/2019-rep-2.pdf">Disability and equity for medicine and public health</a></p>

                              <p>This was sent to externals for `masters examination' 30 June 2019.  The only examiner based outside Australasia requested an oral defence so the `University' updated my transcript to record that I was enrolled in 20 points of MPhil for 2019 (I never applied to that programme) then enrolled under the zero fee scheme for 0 points for several months.  I have a letter saying they will be indefinately detaining me under zero fee enrollment scheme until my thesis is accepted by externals (but of course they won't allow the externals to accept it).  </p>

                              <p>What education and training programme?  What Universities?  They are keeping false enrolment records.  Saying they have students enrolled under the zero fee scheme when they aren't eligible to be enrolled under the zero fee scheme.  Refusing to get work to externals.  I don't know anybody who received reports from externals except myself (and the initial reports were for  a qualification that I wasn't even enrolled in!).  What Universities?</p>
