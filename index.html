 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                            <p>Suppose you wanted to make a bunch of money researching and treating people for x.  The first thing you might well have an interest in doing is increasing the amount of people with x.  Whether it be HIV, Covid, antibiotic resistent bacteria.  How are these things transmitted?  How are they tested for.  Gee...  Couldn't *testing* people in a certain special kind of way be a *method or mechanism on transmission?*  Why, that would be ingenious in psychopath land!  What mechanisms or structural things are in place to ensure that that kind of thing doesn't happen?  What are we supposed to think when we discover them throwing away applications, refusing to graduate studnets when they have met requirements for qualifications, refusing to publically advertise jobs, refusing to employ obviously capable candidates for the position etc etc etc.  So as to redeploy known offenders and the like into these kinds or sorts of positions?  Dr Leeks and so on.  Most beloved.  What are we supposed to think, then?  THey say nobody else applied.  B*llh*t.  They are full of complete and utter b*llsh*t.  The Medical 'Professions' response to the Cartwright Inquiry was 'poor poor Dr Green it wasn't like he was doing anything that anybody else who would be recognised as a Medical Doctor in New Zealand isn't or wouldn't be doing'.  They are dragging their heels over the abuse in state care inquiry for hte reason that they are still at it.  They genuinely don't see anything wrong with those kinds or sorts of things being done.  It isn't like what happened in the abuse in state care inquiry is any different from what is considered 'normal' 'usual' 'typical' 'standard' if not 'compulsory' to be rolled out to as many people as possible in the present.  F*cking psychopaths.  Won't have or allow things to be any other way. </p>

                            <p>Look at the research outputs.  How many words of research are people on payroll to research outputting every year?  And then look at the kind of research that is done (partiuclarly anything funded) so you can see how the research dollars allegedly or apparently go into such really important and worthwhile studies as 'we thoguht this was maybe harmful but we needed to document it for quite some time to be sure so people or animals must be kept like that so we can record the extent of the harms'.</p>

                            <p>But then they pay Chris Whelan to throw away comlaints of wrongdoing (he says the only complaint he acknoweldges as a complaint was mine -- because the High Court Judge said that I actually did lodge one so the courts have ruled that he actually received one).  But it didn't matter that he recieved one because...  The laws don't apply to him because he writes the policy, or something, which means he doesn't have to follow the policy he wrote because he can change it retrospectively to do anything anything anything.  That's why they pay him quarter of a million dollars per year to throw complaints away.  But even if he didn't throw them away he doesn't have to show them to anybody else or action them at all.  In fact, the High Court Judge said that he would be oversteppign his bounds if he actually got evidence to police to assist prosecution or if he held a meeting of the NZVCC so that the University VC's could get their heads together and brainstorm on the issue and figure out amongst themselves what their statutory requirements were on their conduct regarding how they handle applications to enrol, progressions through training (including getting studnets work that has been submitted for examination out to externals to be examined for the qualification the student applied to and basing the outcome on the reports which means allowing the externals to sign off on the students work).</p>

                            <p>But New Zealand doesn't appear to have a health system.  Or an education system.  There don't appear to be any universities.</p>

                            <p>I am thinking very particularly, now, about the efforts to give people rheumatic fever.  I was thinking it was more about housing, before, but now I suspect that is a red herring.  I would expect the bacteria are intentionally being transmitted around in hospital environments.  I mean to say I would think that actually it would be more likely to find that they are not engaging in best practices when it comes to antibiotics, or they are engaging in practices known to be best for transmission of antibiotic resistent bacteria.  They want to develop a vaccine for it, you see.  So they have yet another reason to give children needle stick injuries.  Who does?  The 'Medical Profession'.  </p>

                            <p>The 'Profession' who can't process an application to enrol.  Who won't sign off on studnets qualifications when they have done enough for them.  The 'Profession' who most highly values Dr Leeks.  All these upstanding and esteemed people..  It isn't plausible to think that anybody forged documentation that would have University of Auckland cadavar laboratory tutors allow someone who wasn't on the roll in the classroom.  I mean, there is no way that he forged himself onto the class roll now, is there?  Either he was enrolled in the class (he was on the class roll) or he was not.  I think it most likely that *when it was time to pay him for the work that he had done in the hospital* they decided they didn't want to pay him so it was time for him to go away.  That's pretty much what New Zealand does.  Right?  When it is time to pay.  Either actual dollars.  Or qualifications. When requirements for qualifications have been met.  They won't hand over qualifications, either.  Because then their slaves might go away.  They aren't going to pay them.  And they aren't going to write them references or give them credit or qualifications for the work that they have done either.  F*cking psychopaths.  Hey.</p>

                            <p>Why wouldn't pregnancy be a competition?  The male gets to eat the baby.  The male wins!  How difficult is it to see that?  THe female could eat the baby.  It's like putting something away..  THen it goes off into the world and cry cry cries for government handouts (say) so she gets a return on her investment.  Hey.  Everybody wins.  Well, everybody except the baby.  What's that?  We all lose.  Sure.  Everybody will die one day.  Their nasty bruitish and short little lives will be over.  Lose-lose.  The world that they made.  </p>

                            <p>The world that who made?  Why the elite happy few!  The world that they made!  So they can look down upon the unruly rabble and feel  better about their extermination policies and the like because they don't see any people.  Shows like 'Better Call Saul' and 'Breaking Bad' and even courtroom dramas of the 'Dr Leeks and Dr Green' variety are all just designed to market to the masses that 'there is no alternative'.  'This is the nature of our class'.  'Everybody is a psychopath in our class and opportunitistic.'  So they can convert each other like prions, you see.  Convince or persuade everyone that there is no other way to be.  So the elite can go 'see!  see!  see!' and feel justified ensuring that Dr Leeks and Dr Green etc get stationed into position.</p>

                            <p>I mean life is very differnet for the 'cool kids'.  Is it not?  The kids who are expediated through quickly quickly quickly so they can play military hospital in Christchurch, and the like.  What fun!  What 18 year old boy wouldn't want to experience cervical examinations up close and personal and expereince the fun of having control over anasthetics and the like.  Particularly in a borderland nation where you can do anyting anything anything to the vermin with complete and utter imunity.  Right?  I mean...  How much would you pay?  </p>

                            <p>I mean they just refuse to do things properly.  Won't calculate a GPA according to their published criterion.  Won't enrol studnets in courses they have applied to.  It isn't that more studnets applied than places available in teh course, even, because I intentionally applied to a programme that had no other applicants.  Ffs.  Just beyond ineptitude.  Really.  Refusing to enrol studnets in programmes they have applied to in order to teach them a little lesson in or about complince, apparently.  Because NZ is just a great big detention camp, or something.  NO difference between the education institutions or aged care institutions and the quarantine institutions or the prison instiatutions or the hospital institutions.  Just punative institutions of abuse up and down the land.  Why?  So that the governmetn can run off of the proceeds of crime, apparently.  Not pay the workers.  The 'workers' pay the government in exhange for opportunities granted to them to pimp the prisoners or hostages or slaves or victims or vulnerable out.  Make a living off of the proceeds of crime.  PUt in a plan for how you will keep some segement under your observational watch in conditions of harm and deprivation.  It's how to get government funding.  Right?     </p>

                            <p>Won't process applications to enrol.  Won't give out applications.  WOn't publically advertise jobs.  WOn't hire the most qualified for the job (Ashley did not apply for PhD, do a PhD, did not tutor or grade or work in a University ever but now he is Professor?), won't pay the workers.  There's nothing here.  They aren't even trying just a teeny tiny little bit, at all.  </p>

                            <p>Just a garbage wasteland of complete and utter sh*t.</p>

                            <p>Let me guess.  I must have a baby.  So that you can eat it.  Otherwise I would be selfish.  Riiiiiiight.  That's what selfish meeeeeeeans.</p>
