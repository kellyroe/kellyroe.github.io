 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>Alright, so here's the story.  I am waiting on two things: </p> 

                                <p>(1)  The Australian National University.  They are locating my student records and saying something about why I left the ANU without recieving credit for a PhD.  They say they will get back to me around July 15, 2022.
                                </p>  

                                <p>(2)  The social security tribunal of New Zealand.  The New Zealand government chooses to keep me on less than minimum wage.  I am not shoulder-tapped for work (as is customary), and my applications for work are not progressed (postitions will remain unfilled and re-advertised), my applications, progressions, completions from NZ universities are not progressed, either.  The courts also aren't progressing my filings.  The supreme court has ruled that I am required to pay them more than $20,000 in 'security for costs' to have cases heard on appeal after justice was denied to me in the high court proceedings. 
                                </p>

                                <p>I am aware that they think they can get free labor / free 'work' out of the things that I post to the internet so that stops.  Who profits?  Do the people in the USA like it when I spend my life documenting the crimes of the NZ government?  We document their crimes.  We document their crimes.  We document their crimes.  Shame we can't have health and education and so on.  We document their crimes.  We document their crimes.  We document their crimes.  25 per cent of the population is 'retarded' or 'disabled' or 'incapacitated from earning a full-time salary'.  The government won't pay the people because they are kept handicapped on disability.  They have  been disabled from functioning in New Zealand by the New Zealand Government.  Look how slow I am!  Look what a slow worker I am!  Look how the New Zealand Government can't / progress or process anything when it comes to me.  I guess they put a little label on my name at some point about how I am retarded and kept on welfare for my having been disabled by the Government.  They don't have the capacity to pay me so they'll just take from me and write me up as a terrorist?  Is that next?  You pay $15,000 scholarships for international students to come here and work for 1 or 2 years??  On a Masters Degree.  That will cover their fees.  How will they live?  In their supervisors basement?  Their visa will expire before graduation.  They'll have to leave the country before graduation.  I guess forcing them to leave the country before graduation (which they don't get to do) will help prevent terrorist attacks.  That's a good idea.   
                                </p>

                            <p>
                            The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications.  They define a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  
                            <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a> 
                            </p>

                            <p>Here is how much the Inland Revenue says I owe the New Zealand Government for my 'Education' and 'Training': 
  
                            <a href="judicial-review/ird-shot.pdf" target="_self"> $104,663.</a>

                            They have not provided a break-down of what courses they recorded me as having been enrolled in, in what year.  They acknowledge that I have completed BA(hons) and an MA (I can't tell whether they invoiced 1 year or 2 years or more of fees total for the MA).  They refuse to acknowledge that I have completed anything since.  They keep invoicing my student loan -- even for courses that I never applied to be enrolled in.  They take my research work, particularly, and give it to third parties without crediting me (or paying me) at all.   
                            </p>

                            <p>This is particularly clear with the 'Disability and Equity for Medicine and Public Health' thesis that I wrote.  I only wrote it because they said that writing it would be enough for them to consider my application on it's merits (GPA, interview score, UMAT/UCAT score) for Medicine with Auckland.  They took my thesis and used it for their own ends and they refuse to acknowledge that I wrote it.  And they refuse to progress my application to Medicine.  We don't have a health system.  We don't have an education and training system.  There's nothing here.  It's a detention camp is all.  There's nothing here.  The courts don't / won't / can't function.  There's nothing here.
                            </p>

                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  They aren't progressing the filings. 
                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  
                                </p> 

                            <p>
                            It seems to me that the Australian Constition explicitly states that New Zealand is regarded, by them, to be a State of the Federation of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  Australia refuses to honor it's own Constitution.  New Zealand seems to function as a detention camp of Australia only. 
                            </p>
