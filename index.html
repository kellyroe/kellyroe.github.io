                            <p>How long are you supposed to work full time on a 120 point research project before it goes out for external examination?  How about a 360 point one?  For it to be sent out with instructions for external examiners to examine it with respect to acceptability for the programme the student applied to be working on, and the one they had been working on, I mean to say.  How many decades are you supposed to hand over research to NZ Universities so they can re-atribute authorship to someone else or give your research away or attempt to bury it if they do not like what you have to say? </p> 

                            <p>MA.  The University of Waikato kept me enrolled for 2 academic years and 1 summer school period.  It was a 120 point 1 year research qualification only.  </p>

                            <p>PhD.  The Australian National University had me as a summer scholar.  They accepted my work well enough for them to give me a Government Scholarship to do a PhD.  They never got my work out to externals so that it could be externally examined.     </p>

                            <p>MPhil.  I only enrolled in this because the University of Auckland said that completing it would be enough for them to consider an MBChB application from me and process it on the basis of it's academic merits.  They said I needed to complete a new qualification since my MA was completed more than 5 years ago and the ANU never got my research out for external examination and Auckland said they wouldn't acknowledge Australian Qualification anyway.  So I applied to enrol in a 120 point MPhil with the intention of completing the 120 point programme of study in 1 academic year on a full time basis.  Waikato refused to get the work out for external examination.  Instructing me to keep working in excess of requirements for the Degree.  Then they instructed external examiners to examine it for the wrong qualification (PhD rather than MPhil where a PhD is three years of study and about twice the length).  Then they re-enrolled me in the MPhil for more than 120 points -- even though I never applied to that programme of study.  Then they refused to get more work I had done out for externals.  Then, when the overseas external said he wanted an oral defence they recorded that they failed me for the qualification.
                            </p>

                            <p>So, I have more than 100,000 of student loan for qualifications that NZ Universities refuse to acknowledge.  NZ and Australian Universities won't get my research work out to be externally examined (for the qualification I was enrolled in).  Not because they think externals will fail me.  But because they think they will pass me.  But there cannot be a job for me, apparently.  There will be a job for me only over their dead bodies.  Because they are the  only game in town and it's soooooo competitive.  </p>

                            <p>Auckland University and Otago University are not properly processing applications to MBChB (Medicine).  They are throwing away applications when they think that the applications will appear favorable compared to other applicants.  They are throwing away applications before they go before the Medical Admissions COmmittee so that their preferred candidates (e.g., their dependents) can be the only game in town.  They are not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                            <p>NZ Universites are not functioning as Universities.  They have various people on payroll who do no research.  They refuse to allow their students to have their research go out to externals and refuse to credit them as having completed the Degrees.  That way they are forced to stay in NZ, I guess.  Can't apply for jobs.  Can't apply for research funding.  WOuld only have the applications thrown away, anyway.  Can't leave the country because they don't have any qualifications acknowledged.  MOre than 100,000 debt recorded against my name.  Full time GPA of 8.6.  But no job for me.  Only a job for me over their dead bodies, apparently.  Won't even re-train me then in Medicine.  Since apparently the problem is that we have more Philosophy Graduates than jobs.  Which is why we have to hire USA Graduates and Australian Graduates.  British Graduates.  Foreign Nationals.  So that NZers can be kept unemployed.  Preferntially hiring foreigners.  Even when teh NZers do have Degrees.  But they pretty much stopped graduating NZers.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>
