                            <p>
                            The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications.  They define a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a> 
                            </p>

                           <p>Australasian Universities believe they are entitled to simply refuse to process or progress students work, however.  Take it to court, they say.  Then the courts refuse to progress filings.   
                            </p>

                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.

                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.

                            <p>
                            It seems to me that the Australian Constition explicitly states that New Zealand is regarded, by them, to be a State of the Federation of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  Australia refuses to honor it's own Constitution.

                            ANU was graduating people from the PhD programme when I was there.  So, you can compare the work that I did in 2006 and 2007 with the work that they did and then look at what was said about all of our 6 monthly progress and mid-term review.  Then there's the fact I was granted an extension (so presumably something nice was said about my progress) then there's the large draft that never received any helpful feedback and never went to externals.  Have I done enough for a PhD from the ANU yet?  How many years is it supposed to take?
                            </p>

                            <p>NZ has treated me like I was intellectually handicapped and incapable of University level study since I came back from Australia without a PhD.  
                            </p>

                            <p>A PhD from ANU was a pathway to medicine for at least 3 people I knew of.  Queensland, Melbourne, and ANU Medical Schools, respectively.  But apparently, as a NZ citizen it is not a pathway to or for me.  NZ said to me that they would not recognise a PhD from the ANU for entry to Medicine in NZ.  They said I needed to complete a 120 point minimum qualification in the 'minimum, normal, or standard time' and then they refused to enrol me, refused to get my work to externals, sent it out for the wrong qualification.  They bullied me saying I couldn't do it.  They wouldn't allow it.  They outright lied to me about what was required for completion of a 120 point programme (else it's simply an honorary degree programme decided independently of your work, entirely).
                            </p>

                            <p>And now I'm expected to file and refile and refile and refile with the courts.  The judges order my proceedings 'stayed' and I'm to refile and refile for conference after conference after conference where, apparently, costs can only ever be awarded against me because I don't have a law degree!.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            New Zealand doesn't have a health system, so far as I can see.  That's why Shortland Street is so important.  An 'education' in what to expect of the health system.  Training people to act.  Pay the University to be enrolled as students and get to act as doctors in the hospitals.  Never stop paying the University.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Never stop slaving for the courts of NZ.  Well then.  Stay in your detention camp then.  It seems to me that Sterelny wrote a slavery manifesto.  If I'd have written a torturing innnocent babies for fun (in the name of important medical research in our unique socio-cultural enviornment) then they might have picked me to study and work as a Medical Doctor in New Zealand!
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            They don't progress people on the basis of their academic work.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            They do see themselves as a detention camp.  You are supposed to do your time -- and then they are supposed to pay you.  But when it's time for them to pay you they get real nasty with the bullying you away.  There have been cases documented at Auckland of people being held in psychiatic facily and then deported with their visas revoked.  When it's time for them to graduate you.  When it's time for them to pay you.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            They refuse to pay people fairly and they refuse to develop training systems and systems of training.  They don't pay people to teach.  Because there's never any shortage of people who love the sound of their own voices.  It's so...  Flattering.  When everyone gives you a standing ovation for drinking a sip of water.  Why wouldn't you want to yakkity yak yak to people who hang off your your words all and every day?  Suck up..  And console yourself with getting to kick down.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Dishonest people.  I've recorded my experience with various things so other people can know to avoid them.  I suppose they go 'hahahahahahhaha we are still getting people applying to enrol' and so on.  Sure.  There's no reason to be concerned if you aren't being stoned to death by an angry mob.  That's what morality is all about.  Well done.  Yay you.  ANd then you get sick. And what?  Hope that people will treat you more professionally than you treated other people?  Do unto others and all that.  Oh, yeah, we did away with 'do unto others' and we made an 'in group' and an 'out group' and those who were best at sucking up (and best at kicking down) were most valued.  Kick kick kick kick kick the race to the bottom.  Thanks for the ride.  Thanks for ruining my life.  Yay.  The ANU is so much better for not having given me a PhD.  And Waikato is the very very very very best University in the whole wide world because of all the Research that has been deposited in it's library. All the student research accepted in fulfilment of regulations for graduate research Degrees.  Every time they fail a student they win at the Univesrity game!!!  The very very best University of all for failing their students!!!  Well done!! Good job!!!  The prevention and prohibition of research insittution.  Well done! 
                            </p>

                            <p>So it looks like the plan is to award $15,000 masters research scholarships for Terrorism.  That will be the cost of tuition for international students.  They will need to live in their supervisors basement or figure how to live while they are studying for that degree.  It is a 1 year masters?  It is a 2 year masters?  They need to be enrolled when it is submitted for examiantion and they need to be paid up on their enrolment fees when it is accepted.  The visas are for how long?  1 year?  2 years?  How long do they work before submitting for examination?  When it graduation?
                            </p>

                            <p>Will the theory transition into practice?  When the Degrees are not awarded then will the students terrorist target?  Will New Zealand learn to confer qualifiations when the work has been done sometime within the next 3 generations?  ANy bets on how slow they are going to be?  I would imagine there might be trials around the world..  Let's see who can get a university blown up first.  A public university.  Let's see which country can motivate and inspire terrorism.  It's really brilliant.  In psychopath land.  We don't want education and healthcare and so on.  We like to play these stupid little games.  It's really fun for people who...  Don' thave other kinds of capacity.  I suppose.  Hostages.
                            </p>

                            <p>And now I'm done.  Congrats!!!!! congrats on your terrorist breeding or socialisation programme.  Congrats!!!!  Congrats on your slavery manifesto!!!! Yay you!!!! congrats on staying the proceedings.  Stay....  Stay....  Stay...  Refile!!! refile the refilings!!! Stay!!!
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            They document their crimes.  Their own crimes.  Wastrels.
                            </p>

                            <p>If people don't want to join you in your enterprise well then, you really really must force them then, as slaves.
                            </p>

                            <p>I wish I had never been born.  You win.  Congrats.  I don't like what you chose to do with the place.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Well of course, duh.  Compulsory abortions, all around!
