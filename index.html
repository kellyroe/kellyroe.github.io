 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">

                            <p>See, the thing to realise is that:  It is not a meritocracy.  Is not even trying to be one.  Slave.  Prison.  Detention Camp.  Breeding of Gamma babies to sell or give away...  Not even trying to be fair.  So, what that means..  Well..  People thought that it was a meritocracy.  Made sacrifies (personally) and so on and applied themselves thinking they could work their way up.  But there is no work there way up in a f*cking stupid retard land of imbecils that is not even trying to be a meritocracy at all. Not even trying to be fair.  That takes and takes and takes and takes and takes.  Never stop paying for the crimes of the NZ governmetn.  Never stop paying for the crimes of the Australian Government.  There's nothing here.  Belt them over the  back of the head with hammers if they don't see sense in timely retirement.  F*cking retarded or something from birth, I suppose.  No ability to see what might be fair.  They can't hit 'forward' on their f*cking emails to get work out for external examination.  They are paid to do what, again?  F*cking retarded nation of prisoners.  Not even trying to be fair.  There's nothing there.  Can't do business in stupid-f*cking land jurisdication.  No speak English.  No understand the constitution.  Duuuuuuh.  Duuuuuuh.  WHo wants to go to University to have morning tea?  With the f*cking retards.  Can't even parse the constitution.  Can't even get studnets work out for external examination.  Do you have your external examiners resports Rachel?  Do you have your external examiners reports Nick?  Or did they just tell you you'd done enough to be on payroll while your supervisors took work from other studnets and fed it to you piecemeal.  Took you out of your thesis and substituted everybody else in.  Then put you on payroll to ensure that nobody else's work got sent out for external examination?  Hey better get Daniel to weigh in...  What do you meeeeeeeeean by first keyword of sentence one?  He seems to never manage to read any more than that on any written work sent his way.  Not sure why he's that f*cking stupid.  I guess that's why he's payrolled.  Great Philosophy programme you have there.  That can't / won't process enrolments.  That can't  / won't process completions.  That can't  / wont' get work out for external examination.  F*cking stupid respository of idiots f*cking land.  I'm sooooooo sorry I don't get to go camping with you anymore.  Alll I ever wanted to doooo was go on camping trips with you..  F*cking retards.  Not even trying to be fair.  It gets teh f*cking work and it hits 'forward' to external examiners.  F*cking retards.  Too f*cking stupid, huh.  Who would volutnariliy choose to be enrolled in a programme with people too f*cking stupid to do their f*cking job?  WHo says anybody is voluntariliy enrolle din tehir programme. W hat University?  F*cking retards.</p>

                            <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/opinion/132022958/damien-grant-we-arent-in-a-cost-of-living-crisis-were-just-poor  LMFAO while they give our intellectual property away so that the inbred retards of the elite can pass our outputs off as their own.  That's right.  No productivity in the detention camp of NZL.  All the products got stolen by various people overseas and then passed off as their own.  NZL.  There for the taking.  Right?  What are you going to do about it?  You and whose army?  The Judiciary no speak the English.  'It's only temporary' -- except, of course, for Injustice Toogood.  Only Injustice in town.  Only Injustice the 'courts' would employ.  When does Una Jagose walk away from her hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, again?  I thought she was voluntarily choosing to walk away from her pay cheque in exchange for the role that she played ordering the destruction of evidence and obstruction of justice regarding the abuse in state care.  Oh, NZ doesn't believe in abuse in state care.  That's just how we treat our people.  They aren't 'poor' they are just the slave property of the NZ government.  The state governmetn of one of the states of Australia.  The world seems to only acknowledge them as leaders of a country (and pay them?  Do they pay them?  Do they pay them?) to take the outputs of the NZ people and hand them over to the non productive inbreds of Australia and the USA.  Too f*cking stupid to output a product despite allllll of the evvvvverything being handed to them on a silver f*cking platter.  Still have to go around stealing from people they will only keep poorly.  QUickly quickly march them off to the submarines and drown them in teh ocean.  Obviously Japan isn't going to pour nuclear waste into the ocean.  Rather, the Australians will pile up all their workers (when it's time to pay them) and drown them in nuclear submarines.  Sure.  Great idea.  F*cking amazing.  Most underproductive nations of the world.  It takes the f*cking rocks from out of the ground -- and it f*cking hands them over.  Not that f*cking hard to understand.  Garbage dump of a wasteland.  Only the idiot inbred retarded children of the elites get to be appointed into positoin to prevent and prohibit and obstruct developement.  Nobody is allowed to work any faster than the inbred retarded children of those who grubby grubby grubbed their way to 'elite'.  Oooh I can't imagine wanting anything more than to go to University to eat my lunch with them.  F*cking retards. </p>

                            <p>GAME STUFF</p>

                            <p> https://www.techradar.com/news/this-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-commercial-hurt-to-watch  Wow.  Hmm.  I wonder if you could play WOW on your steamdeck via portable hotspot.  Likely not.  Bums on seats people.  Keep the bums on the seats: Keep the crime rate down.  Pretty sure I learned that sometime during my University Academics.  The reason why they were so obliged to track re re re re re re re reenrollment stats.  If the people are re re re re re re re enrolled in education (bums on seats for all those weekend camping excursions) then we regard them 'engaged'.  Don't need to lock them up as criminals after they listen to however many hours of state-sponsored 'baby shark do do do do do do'.  This is a message brought to you by the NZ diplomat to Ireland.  Nobody else's application for that job was acknowledged as received, you see.  Nobdoy home. </p>

                            <p>Let's see..  Dwarf Fortress with ASCII graphics.  Consensus.  Amazing.  Zelda Tears of the Kingdom.  Consensus.  Trying to do too much on an outdated system.  WTF.</p>

                            <p>I'm sad that Cohh didn't enjoy Zelda.  I wanted him to enjoy it.  I think on some level that he really wanted to enjoy it.  The Diablo people keep saying about 'live out fantasy'.  I mean to say, that seems to be a huge part of what they take themselves to be doing..  In creating character classes and so on.  Creating archtypes (or similar) that allow people to play out a fantasy. Of one form or another.</p>

                            <p>In my game play...  Zelda didn't have pop in or hitch more than Hogwart's Legacy did on a PS5 which was comparable to Diablo IV last server slam IMHO.  They all *slightly* push the hardware (so as to reassure you that they are pushing it and not under-developing for it).  IMHO.  For whatever that is worth...</p>

                            <p>I mean to say...  People were a bit upset about the Druid Class.  Because it was Tauren-beefy and not Elf-Slight.  That was surprising to some.  Disappointing.  Upsetting.  It upset people's fantasy.  People who thought they may be attracted to living out that class fantasy.  I guess.  I suppose.</p>

                            <p>It's funny (strange also haha) that much of the Playstation...  Uh..  Seems to be what you would get if you got a bunch of guys..  Maybe even computer science types of guys who don't actually take a great deal of interest in women or what most women want..  And then you ask them to design something that they think most women want.  Now, I understand that there are engineering and cooling reasons why the PS5 is shaped rather weirdly.  I mean they could have more regularly shaped it -- but it would have been larger..  So the design spec, in some way, was to make it low profile as you can given it's necessary footprint from an engineering pov..  But then some design person thought to put wings on it (e.g., vs D-plate lines) because..  Uh..  Because they wanted to make it as ugly as possible?  Uh...  As V for Vag shaped as possible... One can only suppose.  Who can look at the design decisions with a straight face?  Right?  I mean, c'mon...  </p>

                            <p>Then also you have Horizon..  Uh..  I don't think that..  What's her name..  B..  Something.  Of Tarth..  Is many women's fantasy.  The barbarian woman.  I don't actually think that that is many women's fantasy.  I think that is the kind of thing that happens when you ask guys what women's fantasy would be and they put a female skin on a male fantasy and call you anti-trans if you point that out.  Or similar.  I mean to say..  I don't think that Aloy (in Forbidden West rather than her story in Zero Dawn) is something likely to appeal to women, at all.  I don't think they had much in the way of women making design decisions or anything like that.  The architecture in Hogwarts Legacy seems to have a women't touch.. I don't know who did much of the design aspect of Detroit Become Human...  </p>

                            <p>I mean to say (I'm getting there, I'm getting there) that for whatever reason... I  feel like Cohh was really really really salty about the sword (and various weapons) in Zelda being of limited durability only.  So that the game was more about being opportunistic and using whatever it was that you happened to have on hand.  Having to change up the game-play loop all the time.  Because of the durabilty system.  He did not like that fantasy.  I think that was the thing.  The main disconnect.  The idea of Zelda being about a hero with an amazing sword.  But Zelda (the last two at any rate) is very very very very very much NOT about that fantasy.  Which is upsetting or disappointing or whatever to some...</p>

                            <p>I think about what Zelda is supposed to be / what the intended market is.  Is for.  And it is for kids, primarily.  I can't imagine how it would have been to have been given my own Switch and a Zelda Game.  I don't think it is about in days past.  I think it is about in days present.  People giving such things to kids they care about.  Being able to set parental controls.  Not having to worry about their kids being groomed by US military wannabees (or similar) in chatrooms etc etc...  A high quality experience of entertainment for their kids.  The controller as something of a flight deck.  Imagination inspiring...  I mean, it's a great game for adults, too..  But...  The intended audience.  The audience by which you should rightly judge the games success... It isn't really a game intended to be for Cohh...</p>

                            <p>I didn't get whatever trophy from Diablo.  Boo.  Didn't manage to kill the boss in time..  I don't know why my online calendar messed up..  It looked to me like I could schedule events for myself in PDT and have them show up for me in my Calendar as being scheduled for whatever time that was for me in my time zone.  But it disappeared from my Calendar.  So..  Boo...  I didnt' start the server slam until it was about finished.  </p>

                            <p>The joys of being 'we don't know how lucky we are'...  If only we knew how supremely unlucky we are...  To be the gamma babies.  COme here and pick out your gamma baby for anything anything anything you wanna do, developed world.  Here for the taking!!! </p>

                            <p>I guess they made the Steamdeck to take the heat off the Nintendo being a closed system.  It's about what you do with it, of course.  Who wouldn't want emulators to run Zelda in all it's 4k 120fps porn glory mod capacity or capability!?  Who wouldn't want to give their children devices willing and able to sell them into that!?  Huzzah!!!</p>

                            <p>Hey, you should make a device so all the children of the developing world can upload all their work so the stupid f*cking retards of America can pass it off as their own kids work! What a great idea/l!!! Alll of the payroll for them to keep slaves!!!</p>

                            <p>Steamdeck didn't crash once, this time.  Got booted from the servers a couple times (to be expected in a 'server slam') but really happy the rubber-banding seemed significantly / considerably reduced, mostly eliminated and no steamdeck crashing.  Playing with all the settings the way they are set (I did alter my VRAM at some point -- but later update may have reverted those settings)...  Not a single steamdeck crash whereas previously about every 20 minutes or so.  No lagging that I saw, either.  Even with however many other people zipping about.  Seems better optimised indeed in fact.  Some strangeness on the Steamdeck when it comes to trying to click L stick and put various spells / abilities in to the slots.  Where the on screen touch pad will work to select in fact (when other control input doesn't seem to be working) but it relabels the slots then with keyboard commands instead of steamdeck x-box controller settings...  But that's the only glitchy thing about the steamdeck that I noticed...  And, of course, you have the option to plug in a keyboard and plug in a mouse...</p>

                            <p>_____________</p>

                            <p>I can understand why Harvard wants the democratically elected leader of NZ to read the teleprompts to the NZ people to explain how she's voluntarily choosing to resign in order to...  Be unemployed for a while.  Just voluntarily choosing to walk away from her pay packet.  Then (months later) she's off to Harvard (as a student or person on payroll left unspecified) for a 6 month course in something or other...  I imagine that all the people who pay and pay and pay and pay and pay Harvard to go to what is marketed and advertised as the very very best private University in the USA would like to speak to Jacinda...  The question is:  How much money would you need to buy dictatorship or autocracy so that you could be Lord Saviour and God-King of the Virgin Islands.  No, wait, that's something / someone else.  Let's try that again.  How much money would you need to buy dictatorship or autocracy so that you could be Lord Saviour and God-King of an island in the South Pacific?  Let's aim bigger..  How much money would you need to buy dictatorship or autocracy so that you could be Lord Saviour and God-King of the...  Is it the Second-Largest State of Australia?  How much?  Kim.com was going to buy the election -- right?  We were on track for that, at some point.  But now, instead of him paying and paying and paying and paying to take the election he pays and pays and pays and pays the 'courts' to refuse to extradite him under the presently existing Australian Laws.  Since the State of NZ won't acknowledge the Australian Laws and the Federal Courts of Australia refuse to acknowledge Jurisdiction in NZ.  They can just keep kim.com for further processing in the On-Shore Australian Detention Camp of New Manus Island that is NZ.  Without a trial.  How very...  Australian.  While they wait for the submarines that they can load up people onto and sink them.  Under the water where people can't see...  Because there aren't enough people in Australia wah wah wah wah wah.  We will have to pay money to people to breed...
                            </p>

                            <p>I was reading some article about gaslighting employees the other day.  That's when people in supervisory roles or whatever don't actually do the supervision job for which they are paid.  Instead they bully their employees into handing their work over to them so they can claim credit for it themselves else give it to third parties to claim credit for it.  Take up all the money for themselves and  bully their employees into going away.  Then put various people into place around and about them.  Pimps to get the children to go camping.  Plying the children with alcohol...  Very...  Australian.  Wouldn't you say?  Requiring PhD studnets to go on camping trips and so on...  Not getting their work out for external examination.  Not publically advertising jobs or looking at people's actual work output when it comes time to decide who gets all the research money.  Let's give all the research money to someone to turn Philosophy into second-rate Science.  That's a great idea.  Take all the Philosophy out of the Philosophy Curriculum.  What Philosophy Curriculum?  But then, what University?  They won't acknowledge the research output of people doing research in order to give all the money to people who are horrible obnoxious bullies only.  What evidence of supervision is there for me for my time at the ANU?  I was there as a summer research scholar and Martin Davies refused to write me a reference but the ANU records me being enrolled in their PhD programme.  Then Kim Sterelny refuses to write me a reference and refuses to get my work to externals and refuses to supervise me.  For which he is paid and paid and paid and paid and paid to take the students f*cking camping.  What University?  </p>

                            <p>What hospitals?  What judiciary?  How can there be doctors or lawyers when the University isn't processing enrolments, isn't acknowledging progression through training, isn't graduating people who have met requirements for the qualifications.  Let's only graduate the 'lawyers' who are not capable of doing filings.  Let's only graduate the 'doctors' who follow the instructions written into the patients notes by administration as to who is to die and how they are to die.  Oh, my bad, it's not the administration writing instructions in the patients file.  It must be the AI.  Never was there any better reason to believe in the singularity than 'it must have been the singularity.  The singularity must have done it.  No person is responsible or accountable.  THey were all replaced by robots.  Riiiiiight.  The robots must have done it.  No person is ever responsible or accountable for anything at all.  The source of evil on this world isn't people and their preference for taking studnets camping instead of doing their f*cking work, it must be the singularity'.  Yeah, right.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  You remove the research aspect of the Univesrity (as they did by refusing to process the research work) and you're left with a slave, prison, detention camp.  Who wants to enrol in the Prison Camp of Australia that is the 'premier research institution' that refuses to process students research work?  What Univesrity?  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>The University Administration pretends to be too stupid to process a complaint of wrong-doing.  They won't process the research they say you have to lodge a complaint.  That's good slave-work.  Lodging complaints so the administration can go 'no no no no no no no there could be nothing accepted by the 'university' as being a complaint'. 'In order for us to acknowledge that you have actually lodged a complaint you will need to'...  Ooooooh now we can have fun making up all kinds of stories about what people need to do in order to have their research processed.  I mean in order to have their complaint acknowledged.  Maybe if you go on enough camping trips...  Maybe if you pimp yourself out to one of the old men who should have retired several decades ago..  You should be willing to do anything anything anything.  Right?  It's sooooo competitive, they say.  Must be willing to go on all the camping trips on demand.  Who wants to go to conference and who wants to go to University to have morning tea and afternoon tea.  Lunch and drinks and dinner and drinks.  Really important to keep up the focus on what 'University' is supposed to be about.  The only people they will have on payroll.  What did people actually have to do in order to have their work acknowledged?  Or maybe they didn't.  Maybe they were given work (other people's work) and told they were to pass it off as their own else they wouldn't be acknowledged for anything at all.  Then they were offered jobs on the basis of how many other people's work they stole for themselves or gave away to other people to pass off as their own.  How many people they refused to get their work to third parties and tried to spread rumours that they were non-productive or incompetent so that they could have more and more and more money for themselves to have more and more and more children go 'voluntarily' camping with them.  It's soooooooo competitive they better be willing to do anything anything anything anything.</p>

                            <p>What University?  There doesn't appear to be anything there.  They aren't even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>What Law Graduates?  What Medical Graduates?  What Judiciary?  What Health System?  There's nothing there.</p>

                            <p>What Engineers?  What Plumbers?  Electricians? What Nurses?  Nothing to see, people...  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  Hey, don't forget to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the University so that the people on payroll can tell everyone it's soooooo comeptitive they  better do anything anything anything anything...  What Government Officials?  The graduates of the 'Universities'.  Picked out for how well they performed on their camping trips?  The trips that were sooooooo important to and for their careers?  Yeah, right.  There's nothing there...  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>I suppose it is Harvard, driving the 'how low can we go' game.  MIT manufactures weapons of war and Harvard manufactures reasons to use them.  Just so long as Harvard can point to how much worse everywhere else is, Harvard looks positively attractive.  It's difficult, though, to convince or persuade the world that Harvard is world-leading on Hausering the stats, and the like.  It's not like he was doing anything different from what everybody else on payroll is expected to do -- right?  When your laboratory findings don't translate to the real world then you have to get busy busy busy social engineering the real world to be a better approximation of your monkey torture labs.  Right?  How low can we go?  Think low...  Think low...  Think lower than lower than low...  How much did they have to pay Jacinda to get her to read the tele-prompts to the new Medical Graduates of Harvard to inform them that if they want to do knock-out baby 'research' (we can call it -- but don't worry they can Hauser their stats till the cows come home) getting busy making gamma babies in an environment where it is sooooooooo compeititive they best do anything anything anything anything anything...  Nobody was prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus even when abortion was in the crimes act.  It doesn't matter what any of the laws in NZ are since the only people acknowledged as Law School Grads..  The only people registered to practice Law...  The only people appointed to position as Judge..  The only people on payroll as Judge..  The only people acknowledged as Judge on the (Microsoft Word??) Judgments...  Are people who will give teeth to the fact that...  NZ is a slave prison camp of Australia only.  The laws are not upheld here.  The Judiciary isn't even trying to be fair, at all. What Judiciary?  Output of the 'Judgment Generator' was it?  'There could be no evidence acknowledged by this court that could or would attest to wrong-doing'.  You don't need to pay a person to come up with that.  The Singularity can deliver that Single Computer Generated Response to ALL of the filings presented to the 'courts' of New Zealand.  What courts?  There's nothing here...</p>

                            <p>The Singularity is here!  Computer Generated Responses indistinguishable from the out puts of the NZ Doctors 'give us money give us money give us money else the hostage dies' and the NZ Judges 'give us money give us money give us money and refile the refiling of the refilings' and the NZ politicians 'we hit forward on your email because it's someone else's problem'.  An entire 'skilled workforce' and administration indistinguishable from a computer programme!  The AI of NZ passed the Turing Test..  It only needed to restrict it's human behavior, it's humanity, it's knowledge-base it's skill-base to output decision making judgments opinions and outputs indistinguishable  from the administration of NZ.  It doesn't tell us about the intelligence of AI.  It tells us really rather a lot about the state of NZL.  It's alll sooooo personal, they would have us believe.  It's all sooooo verrrrrrry personal..  That I actually don't know of a single 120 point Masters Research Studnet who was allowed to complete the 120 points programme within 1 year (without reenrolment being recorded against their name).  Why?  So the people they give Harvard Qualifications to (I guess because they paid the 'University') can come to NZ and pick out whatever gamma baby they want.  Babies.  Whatever gamma babies they want so they will do anything anything anything.  Right?  The point is to breed real knock-out babies who will do anything anything anything with joy in their hearts and no complaints.  I mean, who wouldn't want a Down's Syndrome or an Angle-man baby who will just smile and giggle and be happy no matter how badly you treat them.  Right?  Happy happy happy slaves?  That's not the meaning of life?  The point?  The purpose?  The aim?  The Goal?  What do the world-leading Philsophers have to say about the meaning of life?  That it's about understanding our history so we see that we are socially engineering the environments to be Harry Harlow's research lab on love?  That's the idea/l?  I suppose people will pay and pay and pay for that kind of research lab.  Pay and pay and pay to do field research or whatever.  Pay and pay and pay to go camping.   </p>

                            <p>Why didn't the ANU send my work out to external examiners on whatever date it was supposed to go out to external examiners?  What date was that, then?  They didn't even send me a friendly reminder.  But they certainly had access to the written work I had done and a computer script could have been written to hit 'forward' on students thesis submissions to get them to external examiners.  Not even trying to have a research output.  Nothing there.  Nobody home.</p>

                            <p>The Australian Constitution names NZ as the second of the original states in the founding of the Federation of Australia.  It is named there, right after NSW.  It is acknowledged that the Government of NZ and WA at that time did not consent to be part of the Federation.  That did not stop the document declaring WA also NZ to be States of the Federation of Australia being passed and signed and so on by England.  The Federation of Australia (including NZ as a State) was passed.  Acknowledged.  Accepted.  So what the f*ck that the NZ Government gets a seat at the UN.  Why does the NZ government get a seat at the UN?  So it can inform the UN of the present State of the Meat Market.  Highest rates of child abuse.  Highest rates of abuse.  Highest rates of suicide.  Highest rates of 'suicide' (declared to be so by the only people they will payroll).  The leaders of other nations keep insisting that the likes of Jacinda are leaders of a Country.  A Nation.  NZ.  Rather than acknowledging them as Premier's of the prison camp detention centre slave State of Australia.  They won't pay the workers.  What is this bullsh*t NZ currency?  What the hell is that?  To disguise just how low the wages are kept.  To prevent the slaves from travelling etc.  F*cking farce of a situation.  Pretending to be too f*cking stupid to read it's own constitution.  Not processing NZers for Australian Government work etc.  Not allowing them access to Australian Edcuation.  What Australian Education?  There's nothing there.  They can't  / won't process enrolments, completions.  THey took most of the content out of the curriculum.  What curriculum?  What curriculum contents?  Slave camp prison detention land.  There's nobody home.  I don't see any people.  What people?  What humanity?  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  Quickly quickly take the children camping and steal all of their work and pass it off as your own. Real destination for all the High Quality people to visit from the US and so on.  Blackbirding for slaves.   </p>

                            <p>I mean, what do you say to Canberera when they are so focused on changing their constitution to formally acknowledge Aboriginal Auatralians (best I can figure the strategy here is to then say that they didn't get enoguh support from the voters to include Aboriginal Australians formally in the consittuion).  It doesn't f*cking matter what tehir constitution says because they won't acnkowledge the one they actually have at present.  The federal courts of Australia will only give teeth to their Judiciary being too f*cking psychopathic or stupid (or what is the problem, then?) to parse their own constitution.  Will not even uphold what it actually says clearly in the f*cking text.  What part of NZ being named as the second original state of the Federation of Australia is too f*cking hard for you to understand?  No wonder they can't process research work.  Too f*cking stupid.  Too f*cking psychopathic.  I tell you what...  It must be the singularity.  You feed it the constitution and all it does it f*cking humm...  Indistinguishable from the think-tank of Canberra.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  What University?  Can't even read Australian English.  Maybe the problem is the lack of Australian Values.  What values?  Where in the curriculum do you learn about values?  What has value?  See where the payroll goes that's for sure.  The people they choose to put on their payroll.  Refusing to process applications to enrol. Refusing to process students work.  Refusing to get their work out for external examination.  Won't publicalliy advertise jobs.  Won't employ people for the positions.  There's nothing there.  F*cking psychopaths.  Not even trying to pretend to be anything ather than a prison slave detention camp.  Will not pay the workers.  What research output?  There's nothing there. </p>

                            <p>Hey, I have a 'job'.  It goes like this:  you pay me you pay me you pay me you pay me you pay me.  You have to take my job.  Otherwise the government writes you up as non-compliant, you see.  You'll have to live in a government institution of abuse (a 'university' or a 'polytech' or a 'hospital' or a 'prison' or a 'school' or a 'training programme') where people pay the NZ government how much?  To get to do anything anything anything anything...  Or is it that the only people the government will payroll are the people who were moved here because they were bullies and abusers.  Do they come here because we go blackbirding for them?  Or do they voluntarily choose to come here all voluntary-like?  THey do their research and see...  How much would you have to pay to do anything anything anything to the virgins of the virgin islands?  How much money would you have to pay to get shipped to New Zealand where they don't prosecute anybody they don't see anything wrong.  The law firms with the monopolies on prosecution are conflicted out of prosecuting (Meredith Connell says just so long as people put a dollar in their pocket in their private function they are conflicted out of prosecuting them).  Not even pretending to have a fucntioning judiciary.  It's like some people read To Kill a Mockingbird and went 'how will we work only to prevent and prohibit and obstruct and confuse and deny and ensure that there be absolutely nothing at all like that in this part of the world'.  SOcially engineered prison camp slave camp detention faciltiy.  Not even trying to be fair. </p>

                            <p>Hey, I have an idea so the prisoners can think that they are not slaves.  Let's pay and pay and pay and pay someone to make up job advertisements.  Make it look as though there are actually jobs.  They can advertise the jobs and then get the applicants jumping through all kinds of hoops.  It's soooo competitive htey must be willing to do anything anything anything.  I mean, Hitler says 'jump' (or something) and they say 'how high' (or something).  It's sooooooooo comeptitive!  It's sooooo competitive!!! You best sign up for all the camps and go off camping!  For the sake your your career!!!  So they can advertise the jobs.. And then do interviews.  Where they bully the person for a while.  Is is 1 year of frictional unemployment?  NO, come on!!!  Decades, isn't it?  Let me be a lesson to you...  In how many decades of 'frictional unemployment' where the government chooses to pay 'recruitment people' so they can make up phoney jobs and collect up applicants data and hold fictional interviews and bully them and bully them into believing they are worthless with no skills...  ALl these empty jobs for 'recruitment' people!  It's like the most wanted position of all.  People to work as 'recruitment' people where you get paid to make up phoney jobs, collect up applicants data to be sold or given away, bully people in the name of interview and you can make a living for yourself if only you are willing to do everything that is expected of you as a recruitment person!  Best job, ever, for a certain personality, wouldn't you say!  You should have a think therefore about teh qualities they most value for work in teh health sector, the education and training sector.  What private sector?  How can anybody actually do business in the NZ jurisdiction when Australia refuses to hear cases (but even if they did hear them there is no indicator that they would be more competent than the NZ courts)...  WHen the NZ courts will give teeth only to there being no justice here. </p>

                            <p>Let's be clear.  So far..  Precedent...  Justice Toogood is past retirement age.  After a lifetime of payroll as a lawyer and then Judge for NZ.  That wasn't enough for him.  They pulled him out of retirement and put him back on payroll as judge.  Which is no the process for appointing judges.  But that doesn't matter.  They can choose whoever they want to be judge on entirely personal grounds.  Or maybe the singuilarity put everyone who wasn't eligible in a hat and pulled out his name!  doing well NZL indistinguishable from a poorly scripted AI, well done!  He decides that he doesn't see anyting wrong with NZ Universities recording that someone has been enrolled in a programme of study they never applied to be enrolled in.  NZ Universities can keep enrolment records and transcripts and collect money from the NZ government and the NZ government can record IRD debt against a persons name for a programme of study that the student enver applied to.  Justice Toogood was appointed Judge (not via proper process) so he could put his name to that judgment.  That NZ does not have Universities.  They have slave prison endentured servant camps.  There is no education system.  </p>

                            <p>Justice Fitzgerald found that I was technically correct in a technical matter.  She then gave teeth to how NZ does not have a judiciary working in the interests of justice by interpreting 'costs follows the judgment' as meaning that I get a discount on the costs that I must pay the courts for being techincally correct in the matter that I brought before the courts.  In other words, I must pay for the governments crimes.  What crimes?  They are not processing applicantions to Medicine properly.  They are not following the criterion they published for the purposes of their own accountability.  New Zealand is not training Medical Doctors at all.  They aren't processing applications to Medicine.  That makes sense of why Jacinda is paid (presumably she was paid) to go tell the graduates of Harvard that they can come to NZ and do anything anything anything they want to the foetus' of New Zealanad without fear of criminal prosecution.  The courts don't even function in civil cases.  The Government refuses to prosecute and even if you put a dollar in Meredith Connell's pockets the courts won't appoint judges via proper process.  But even if they do they won't find in the interests of justice.  But even if they do (e.g., Ms Roe is techincally right in a technical matter) they give teeth only to there being no Justice in NZ.</p>

                            <p>I hear people go 'the trouble with her is that she thought things were supposed to be fair'.  No..  The trouble with me is that I thought that people were trying to work towards things being fairer.  But that's not true.  F*cking psychopaths.  There's nothing here.  Only those unwilling and or unable to work towards that were put in positions of power, were payrolled.  F*cking psychopaths.  Is Harvard really taht f*cking terrible nad bad and horrible that they have to busy themselves so much towards picking out and pointing to the Virgin Islands and New Zealand and going 'at least we are doing better than there?'  Seems so.  The choices they make as to who to graduate and where to send their army of psychopaths.  </p>

                            <p>Where did John Key go to, not long after he was seen pulling girls ponytails in public (and doing who knows what in private)?  But he didn't walk away from his pay cheque voluntarily-like, now, did he?  He was actually elected out.  Allegedly or apparently.  Because they count the votes.  Of course they do.  Yeah, right.  Where did Brian Tamaki go?  I'm wondering because last I heard the government was so afraid of him they needed to play Baby Shark at him to soothe him before the locked him up as a violent terrorist.  He was intending to run for election, last I heard.  Before they decided that he'd be better off in Mt Eden prison because that's what prisons are for, in NZ.  Enforcing the 'there is no alternative'.  What election?  What difference does it make?  If the election had have turned out differently then, what?  The latest abortion law wouldn't have been changed under urgency (urgency it's an emergency so no public consultation).  What is at issue is the manner or way the government went about changing the law and announcing that it had been changed.  To Harvard.  After Jacinda declares to Harvard that the only way you get elected to be PM Of NZ (or to be in parliament generally) is to take the bribes and so on.  Else you would never be announced as having been elected.  Who funds Chloe Swarbrick's billboards?  I didn't see a billboard for an alternative Auckland Central Candidate.  National Government refused to allow there to be one?  Thought that a female bodybuilder wearing her sporting uniform made her unfit to run on personal grounds, or similar.  Decided that proper process on candidate selcetion did not apply to them.  What political parties?  There isn't anything here...</p>

                            <p>What has the NZ government paid out for harms arising from the Covid Vaccines?  What has the government of USA, Canada, Australia, England, Ireland paid out?  Have the other nations acknowledged harms arising from teh compulsory vaccine?  Have they supplied compensation to victims or their families?  NZ Government said that they would take responsibility and they waived the manufacturers responsibility that people of every other f*cking nation have.  The NZ Government announces that the NZ people are to be targeted for all the crappy batches, all the experimental trials because they volunteer the people of NZ to bear all of the costs.  THe governmetn takes the responsibiltiy because they must be the singularlity!  All of teh responsibility means they do everything and anything tehy want without any accountability for themselves at all.  The most accountable government in teh world (yeah right) is the one that is most restrictive on lock-down policies.  We didn't even have many or any deaths before the government declares the nation in lock-down.  Business as usual in NZ.  That is to say no business.  That is to say prison camp.  Detenetion camp.  Slave camp.  There's nothing here.  Not even trying.</p>

                            <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/489938/international-student-numbers-growing-but-not-everywhere  Aw.  Chris Whelan (incapable of processing complaints of wrongdoing -- his statutory function) wants new markets!   New markets!  New markets!  Where his reputation does not preceed him, one can only suppose.  Maybe show the footage of Roe v the NZVCC Commmittee to 'new markets' before agreeing to take the slaves to do the slaving before they are deported when it's time to graduate or pay them.  Time to march them off into the submarines.</p>

                            <p>The 'news' of NZ is always interesting how they don't pay the photographers.  'Stock image on file'.  Interesting that the University of Canterbury would choose to fire probably the only productive member of the English department for contracting out -- 1 lecture, was it?  I thought the allocation of 'rations' was on a department basis.  They decide if Justine Kingsbury gets a 4 / 4 teaching workload, for example, in exhange for her tenured paycheque.  They decide whether she gets a student-slave to do her grading or teaching for her.  To do her tutorials -- else whether she has to front for them.  Do  her own grading -- else whether she has a 2nd year student 3rd year student 4th year student decades old student slave doing her grading for her.  The University decides -- do they?  How to allocate the teaching work?  So it is not for individual employees to pay their studnets a pittance to do their teaching work for them.  How about if the employees take their students work and pass it off as their own research, then?  Is that a fireable offence too?  The judiciary doesn't see anything wrong with firing someone for subcontracting teaching work when that is the norm.  Right?  The aspirational goal.  For people on univesrity payroll to actually be being productive with their research output so that they can't meet their...  Was that a 4/4 teaching workload again?  How many thousands of studnet essays was there to grade for that, then?  What Universities?  Nothing home.  Nobody home.  Hey why not pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and then be put in a submarine when it's time for you to graduate.  What a great idea!</p>

                            <p>Brett Calcott:  'They used to pay me to work in IT'.  Yes.  What do you want me to say?  'And now...  They don't'.  Congrats dude.  You made it.</p>

                            <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/300878937/nails-glued-upside-down-on-new-childrens-playground-by-vandals   How much work does it take to glue a nail on upside-down do you think?  You have to hold it up for a time while the glue solidifies?  Does that seem like the 'work' of 'hoons' to you?  Or does it seem like a more intentional statement.  I don't konw..  Ask the people on government payroll to create terrorists.  Maybe...  THe people who actually built the playground.  Did you pay them?  Or did they point out some health and safety problem that meant the playground was not really suitable for kids to be playing in it and then when you ignore them they try and indicate to everyone not fit for purpose the only way they can.  I mean...  Principle of charity.. Why oh why oh why would someone glue nails upside down in a kids playground?  Why?  Really?  No ideas.  Totally and utterly unfathomable.  WHat, with NZ's complaints resolution policy and process.  What, with all of the effort and energry that's spent on identifying wrongs and dworking to put them right (instead of going after the complainant trying to bully them to death).  F*cking garbage wasteland.  Not even trying.  No hint of try. </p>

                            <p>Well, now that the prevention and prohibition of progress in breast cancer lady has died maybe there can be some progress in breast cancer after all.  Mostly what they want to do is take the tumors and see if they can grow the tumor cancer cells in dishes.  If they can keep them alive for long enough they may be able to seed them into many different women.  Increase the proliferation of breast cancer.  Particularly if they devise the only cure for it.  Think how much money they can get for all of the hostages.  All of the people with the breast cancer that they seeded and them having the only possible treatment for it, and all..  Need to kickstart a gofund me to raise tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars else however many hostages must die!!!  Oooooooh who wouldnlt' want to be a Medical Doctor!!! THink of the money to be made!!! It's soooooooooooooo competitive!!! Anything anyting anytihng anything!!!!</p>
