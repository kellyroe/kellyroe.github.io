                        <div class="container">

                            <p> https://www.seek.co.nz/job/69999879?type=standout#sol=26437d7ee5d9aa8d6a73355485697945bd28bd43  Now the government wants 'managers' (with no academic background in medicine or research) to run the clinical trials and medical experiments to be conducted on 'target populations' (i.e., the gamma babies) in the naaaaaame of 'equity'!  Everybody knows that that's the job of government.  To run medical experiments on people who have no right to protest, object, or not be volunteered.  The government is sooooo busy doing things it's not supposed to be doing (things beyond it's scope) that it doesn't have any time or money or resources left to do any of the things that they're supposed to do.  I guess it makes sense that Ayesha and Shane and Ashley would be graduated from Medicine.  They have how many  hours of clinical practice  between them?  That was why they were graduated -- right?  Because they never would be paid to work that job.  What univesrity?  But then, what government?  What election?  What developed nation?  There really doesn't seem to be anything there...  Can't even / won't even process applications to enrol.  Hurry hurry hurry give everything to the highest bidders from overseas so you can lure them here under false pretenses.  How much does it cost for a South African born person who trained in England to buy for themselves 'New Zealander of the year'?  She was the marketing con-munications face of Medicine -- wasn't she?  So...  Do her 'students' who work in her 'laboratories' with infectious organisms have PPE, yet?  What education system? </p>

                <p> Now that Justice Toogood (pulled out of his retirement for the occasion)  has found that there isn't anything wrong with the Universities of NZ saying that students have  been enrolled in programmes of study that they never even applied to be enrolled in...  The Government wants to record that how many have  been enrolled in MBChB Degree programme?  That's how much debt against their names?  For a programme of study where..  How many was it, Harlene?  1/3rd of the class had graduation withheld -- because the University said that they refused to accept that they had  been signed off as having completed their internship requirement.  Even though it had  been signed off  by international community.  The University of Otago refused to graduate them.  Not exactly a University, hey.  Prison.  Slave.  Detention camp.
                </p>

                <p>Let's all be enrolled in a 'Degree' programme where we can play doctors and nurses and do anything anything anything everything everything Dr Leeks 2.0 says when he says because he says...  Else...  What?  Be imprisoned in the name of 'psychiatry' and fed horse tranquiliser and surgical anasthetics else pronounced 'suicided' all 'voluntary-like'?  What health system?  They can't even / won't even process an application to enroll on the basis of it's academic merits.  They can't even / won't even acknowledge progression through training programmes.  They can't even / won't even graduate people who have done the work that was required for their qualifications.  They won't get the work to external examiners.  They won't allow it to be examined on it's academic merits.  They won't allow international community to sign off.  There's nothing there.  They just won't do it.  Taken over by psychopaths.  Right, Sterelny?  Selfish, selfish, selfish, they're all so f*cking selfish.  Why would anybody help anybody?  What a joke.  It's soooooo competitive!  It's sooooo competitive!  Only over their dead bodies,  hey.  What health system?  What judiciary?  There's nothing there. </p>

                <p>They are being clearer, now, about how it's just a front for the control of people they regard to be sub-persons.  Not person centred, hey.  All about the prevention and prohibition of persons.  Sign the subs up for observational studies or clinical trials or both where at least some are kept in conditions known to be inhumane.  Those who run the studies we can call 'medical doctors' or 'clinical nurses' or..  It really doesn't matter what you call them.  The less education people have, the younger they are when you get them doing anything anything anything everything everything you say when you say because you say...  Pushing and pulling the levers on demand.  Everyone in Australasia would follow the instructions to electrocute someone to death if they thought they would get away with it.  Right?  That's the whole point of these lands?  Don't get sick, now, Chris.  And the only alternative.  Chris.  Right.  The only people who were accepted as candidates for the there is no alternative.  What democracy?  It doesn't seem to matter what any of the laws are because the judiciary refuses to uphold the laws.  Not even trying to be rule by law.  And so, why, then, would international community be constrained by or ruled by international laws when it comes to how they deal or interact with the leaders of New Zealand?  I mean, seriously...</p>

                <p>The great marketing campaign is how kim.com was not extradited to stand trial.  Not even the US.  Come to NZ all the people who might be subject to criminal proceedings overseas.  We have declared ourselves to be a nation where those awaiting trial can come to all voluntary-like.  An entire nation kept in detention.  Shortland Street the media propaganda of how to pass yourself off as a doctor or a nurse or...  Yet another propaganda campaign.  The government wanting to hire people to manage social media accounts for the government.  Don't forget to write a bot to up-vote the politicans everybody!  The government paying people to create dis-information.  Wouldn't pass the bot tests if it tried.  There's nobody home.  Nothing there, hey.  Come to NZ all you graduates of Harvard!  Nobody was ever prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus in NZ even when abortion was in the crimes act as a criminal offence.  And now it's taken out so NZ can be the destination of choice for all those 'knock-out' baby (gene) studies.  All the experiments or observational studies on the long term effects of oxygen deprivation etc for the infants hauled out early (steroids will surely help) and kept in Fisher and Paykal incubators to  be experimented upon.  'I'm soooo glad I'm a gamma baby I don't have to work half as hard as Ashley'.  Made Professor, was he?  Without a PhD or MD.  Without having done the academic work for one.  Without a reserarch thesis.  Without any publications.  Makes sense.  That someone who hadn't done the work would be appointed into position while those who have done the work have their qualifications withheld.  Only treat the involuntary non-voluntary non-consenting.  They have been volunteered.  They have been consented.  What part of it is hard to understand?</p>
