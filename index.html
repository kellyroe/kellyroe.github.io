                             <p>Roe v University of Waikato established the University of Waikato (an e.g., of Universities NZ) to enrol students in programmes that they never applied to.  I mean to say, record debt with the IRD.  To tell the IRD that they have recorded a student enrolment that the student never applied for.  To invoice or bill them differently from the government maximums.  How can they possibly lose money on a 'Medical School'?  They can simply record that ALL the teenagers aged between...  16?  Maybe 14?  Maybe 7?  And...  Um...  65?  Why stop there?  Just record all of them being enrolled  by the University of Waikato.  Year after year after year.  Then they can have 'opportunity' to turn up to the Waikato Hospital for their workplace internship requirement.  Basically say:  'Hello.  I am your (student) doctor.  I think you should have a breast / cervical / prostate / colon screening exam.  You have been consented.'  Cheapest health system ever.  All of the re re re re enrolment fees (all of the visa re re re re processing fees).  No graduations.  No employment.  Why would you pay workers when you get re re re re enrolments to pay and pay and pay the government get some visa re re re re processing all of the money for the government.  What economy?  Till it's time to pay you -- and they lay down and die.  All voluntary- like.  It's totally voluntary.  Nobody wants to get paid a working wage.  They all sign the euthanasia forms all voluntary-like.  They have been volunteered. </p>
