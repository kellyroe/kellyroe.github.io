                             <p>
                              <a href="./writing/ks.png">Here is an example of an email from Kim Sterelny (who will not write me a reference).</a> 

                              I collated the 'few small chunks' as he refers to them, here:
                              </p>

                            <p>The teaching temporary register</p>

                            <p>We'll keep a list of people who want to teach in the schools.  It's important for the government to match supply and demand so that the government does not have to pay the teachers.  They can simply phone someone from the wait list and offer them 1 days temporary relief work.  Say that someone called in sick.  Just do ALL of the employments like that.  Just phone people up from the temporary register.  Maybe offer them 1 week here.  Maybe even 2 weeks there.  Turns out that you can get people turning up to do a days teaching work (so to speak) without even being paid for it.  See how many days or weeks or months work you can get out of them -- without even paying them!  If they don't like it you can simply blacklist them.  It isn't like there aren't a million more temporary migrants lining up behind them.  You could recruit from people fresh out of prison, in the name of second chances.  Doesn't matter where you find them.  Just put them in front of the class and they can play school.  There's really no need to pay teachers.</p>

                            <p>Then you can assess for all the non-verbal important skills like whether the temp worker will turn a blind eye to kids smoking or taking drugs in the bathrooms.  If that's okay maybe the teachers smoking or taking drugs in the  bathrooms.  If that's okay maybe the teachers drugging the kids in the bathrooms.  If that's okay..  Well, we see how we recruit for all the qualities we value.  Don't even have to pay anybody to work that job, it turns out!  They'll do anything anything anything!  Oh yes they will, indeed.  Anything and everything they say.  Right?  Else they'll be blacklisted.  No doubt.  No pay for them.  Off to the death camps for them!  See ya!</p>

                            <p>The nursing temporary register</p>

                            <p>I'm sure you see how this is going.  Ring ring.  We need someone to come in to work today.  There's some injections in that room over there and some patients in that room over there.  They've all been consented to have the injections.  I think it's an immunisation, or something?  Off you go...</p>

                            <p>Maybe go collect some samples from the ones over there, and try implanting what you collected into these other patients.  Those kinds of collection samples won't grow in petrie dishes, didn't you know?  We'll have to try and keep the cancer cell lines growing in unpaid volunteers.  Off you go.  Maybe we'll pay you later.  </p>

                            <p>Hospitality</p>

                            <p>Not sure how well you will fit in.  Hey, we have someone call in sick.  Can you come in for the evening?  A trial.  Yeah..  Just come in for the evening and we'll see how things go..  We think someone might be leaving next week, so a spot for a permenent will  become available...</p>

                            <p>Ghosted.</p>

                            <p>Let's just keep lists of temporary so we can pull from the list of temporary only.  Never pay anybody to work that job. Just pull from the list of temporary only.</p>

                            <p>Don't forget to breed, everybody!  We don't have enough people!  We don't have enough volunteers to do all the unpaid slave labor that we won't pay anybody to do!  Don't forget to have kids, everybody!  Once we get rid of the old (only once it's time to pay them) we'll need to put new studnets to slave work in the name of internships.  That's a great idea.  They can pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the 'University' for their enrolment (and re enrolment and re enrolment and re re re enrolment in programmes of study they never applied to be enrolled in) while doing all of the work for none of the pay.  Why don't they stand up for themselves?  Off to the death camps for them!  Anybody have a problem?  Anybody have a complaint?  </p>

                            <p>Would you like to move to NZL?  We have a shorage of skilled workers.  By which we mean, quite simply, that we don't want to pay anybody to do skilled work.  We won't pay them.  We would rather keep wait lists of people who will come and volunteer their time pretending to work the job.  That's why we provide Shortland Street as a major export to the world.  It's a little role play so people can see roughly kind of sort of how they are expected to conduct themselves in the healthcare situation.  So that we will never need to pay the workers.  No shortage of people volunteering for free auditions.  Who wants to play doctors and nurses?</p>

                            <p>Would you like to play university acadaemic?  We can get the second year students teaching the first year studnets.  Let's have a mooting thing where the second year students can play being judges.  Turns out we don't need to pay anyone.</p>

                            <p>I'm sure there is no shortage of people over the age of 65 wanting to play at various things.  You don't have to pay them.  They've taken more than 45 years of highly paid government payroll for themselves already.  They have nothing to lose.  Right Justice Toogood?  What's the worst that can happen?  Removal from office?  You aren't supposed to be in office.  You are supposed to be retired.  Do they pay the assistant or associate who gets to follow you around the nation when you go on tour?  Gets to complete you or your judgment or something from various hotel rooms?  Is that how it works?  How it doesn't work?  How it is that you simply can't see anything wrong?</p>

                            <p>The (likely fake) news says that Ashley Bloomfield was appointed Professor of Public Health (or similar) with Auckland University.  He never applied to do PhD or MD so far as I know.  He never did the work for either of those research qualifiations.  He hasn't done doctoral level work for 3 years.  He hasn't got a research output.  Why don't you pay someone who did the work to become professor to be professor?  Why do you hire the least qualified person for the job?  What University?  What hospital?  What school?  What judicary?  There's nothing there.</p>

                            <p>I did not see ANY student (any doctoral studnet) from the ANU with reports from external examiners.  Variosu said that they were told that the externals accepted their work without any changes or anything.  That's not plausible.  You can always say 'read just one more thing' or 'reference just one more thing'.  Or 'swap the position of chapters 2 and 3 around because I said'.  Or, 'I have written this thing, reference my thing'.  Or 'I found a typo!' etc.  It's not plausible that external examiners don't find 1 thing to pick at in a piece that's abou 100,000 words long to be written in 2-3 years. </p>

                            <p>I did not see ANY student do a public oral defence.  Nobody did one.  I would have attended -- but there weren't any to attend.  They weren't having their studnets work examined.</p>

                            <p>I never saw anybody (any PhD graduate studnet, any recent PhD graduate) in an ANU academic gown.  No graduations.  I didn't see anybody with pictures or conferred degree certificates.  Unlikely that people wouldnt have been having them framed etc.   </p>

                            <p>There is nothing there, hey.</p>

                            <p>Martin Davies and Kim Sterelny refused to write me references when they were my named supervisors.  They wouldn't do it.  What am I supposed to do in the face of that?  Offer to suck their dicks?  Slip them a hundred dollars?  What the  hell?  I did the work..  What the hell..</p>

                            <p>Did they write other people references?  I guess they did.  Other students of the ANU were given paid positions.</p>

                            <p>Were they?  Or is that a hoax, too?</p>

                            <p>What education and training system?  Not even trying to be fair at all.   There's nothing there.</p>

                            <p>What skilled employment?  There's nothing there.</p>

                            <p>Sah's a medical student, apparently.  Because she spends most of her day teaching les mills group fitness classes across several gyms around Auckland.  Teaching classes or commuting to the gym to teach the classes.  Of course she does.  She doesn't have a qualification in sport and exercise science.  How much do they have to pay her to do that, then?  How does she find the time to attend her hospital placements?  From Middlemore to the North Shore?  When does she find the time to commute around Auckland all day..  When does she find the time to study?  That's what it meeeeeeans to be a Medical Student.  Clearly.  Spending your time commuting to teaching group fitness classes.  What it meeeeans to be an ED doc.  I guess they don't give Amy enough shifts.  She has to moonlight as a spin instructor.  They don't pay her enough, she needs to take up the secondary employment in order to eat, or something.  I don't know how the ED docs find the energy to teach spin in their off time!  But, then, I guess Shane Reti is registered to practice Medicine 1-3 weeks of every year only (write a years worth of prescriptions in 1-3 weeks, does he) and all of Ashley's patients..  Well..  He's not registered and he doesn't have any.  Right?  Else they would not be saying that he had a Medical Degree.  No doubt.    </p>

                            <p>There's nothign here.  Worst scam ever.  </p>

                            <p>Australia is not any better.  Not even trying to be.  They chose to take Sterelny and his fabulous buisness model (of how to destroy everything from within) and transplant that to Canberra.  Everything it is that they value.  No values in Philosophy.  Nothing of any value.  Took the philosophy out of Philosophy.  No meaning.  No truth.  No mind.  No values.   Nothing of any value.  Just the selfish psychopaths having taken over the whole thing, right Sterely?  Selfish selifish selfish selfish selfish.  There's nothing there.  Nobody home.  </p>
