                            <article>

                                <p>The next episode in the Bloomfield show.  So, Ashley Bloomfield.  Sorry, by bad, Doctor Ashley Bloomfield.  That is to say, Ashley Bloomfield MBChB.  That is in virtue of which he is 'Doctor'.  Correct?  I mean to say, he is acknowledged by the University (but even is he?) as having completed the undergraduate level degree MBChB.  It is regarded by the university to be an undergraduate level degree.  They enrol students in the qualification in their second year of university study (before they have graduated from an undergraduate level qualification) and they don't let those students apply for the graduate student housing (which is primarily for the families of doctoral students).  
                                </p>

                                <p>Anyway, back to the plot.  So, after he got his MBChB he did a...  was it a 2 year 240 point Masters in Public Health?  Or was it a 1 year 120 point Masters?  Did it have 1 year of course work followed by a 1 year up to 50,000 word thesis, or was it something else?  Anyway, so then he gets a Masters in Public Health.  Then, insted of working with patients (that's the sense in which he's a Doctor) he gets paid more money working as a civil servant.  They pay him not to see patients.  They also pay Shane Reti to spend most of his time not seeing patients.  Ayesha also.  The Medical Doctors that New Zealand trains and then chooses to pay not to work with patients.</p>

                                <p>I don't think I have ever in my whole life heard of a person with their highest level degree being a Masters Degree...  Being made professor.  Particularly all out of the blue when he hasn't worked his way up academia because he hasn't been in academia.  He hasn't tutored at University, has he?  Run tutorials?  Graded essays?  Tenure must have been a big moment for him.  I think of all the temporary contract people at the University of AUckland who have been working for the University for how many years...  Often the University still hasn't sent their PHD thesis out for external examination (e.g., Angela who does Medical Education etc etc I think after however many years they still haven't sent her PhD out because they don't want to pay her fair wages for the work that she does)...  He didn't work as a Junior Lecturer, an Associate.  ANd he's made professor.  Hmm.</p>

                                <p>Is it a 'terminal masters' as the Univesrity of Waikato likes to say.  The idea/l being the the point of the entire qualification is some kind of hospice where academics go to die.  THe qualification that Ashley Bloomfield is professor of, I mean to say.  The entire research school or centre.  He can't supervise higher level than what he has.  I mean to say he can't supervise PhD students because he does not have a PhD.  Does he?  Did he ever apply to do one?  Did he write one?  Did it go to externals?  Did the externals write reports?  Did the uni actually get sign off sheets to the externals?  I don't think he's that kind of doctor...</p>

                                <p>One response is..  Oh wells.  I mean, if people are silly enough to choose to enrol in that qualification (maybe because University employees tell them that that's the way to get to study Medicine) then maybe that's on them.  Only the High Court Precedent is that students don't get to decide what courses or programme of study they are enrolled in.  Justice Toogood said he did not see anything wrong with the University having enrolled me in things that I never even applied to be enrolled in.  So, I wonder who the governmetn will choose to enrol in Ashley Bloomfields terminal masters qualification.  I suppose it must be.  The hospice of the university.  I suppose it must  be.  Check in with the IRD everyody.  See wehat the university is invoicing you for having you enrolled in programmes of study you never even applied to.  What a f*cking farce.</p>

                                <p>PhD is supposed to be a 3 or 4 year research programme.  That is or means to say it is supposed to be a 3 year research programme - but the external examination process can take up to 1 year.  I mean to say it could take 3 months before reports are written.  6 months before oral examination.  Then another 6 months to do changes that may be suggested by external examiners.  So it is extendible to 4 years.  But New Zealand Universities are not honest with the students about the timeline the students need to be working to.  They think that their job, goal, aim, purpose, point is to undermine and stabotagae and prevent and prohibit and obstruct.  It's soooooooo competitive.  So they threaten to fail studnets outright if they don't agree to keep working and keep working and keep working and keep working and keep working.  Sometimes they even make you do changes to make it less likely to be accepted by the externals.  The whole thing is a f*cking farce of a joke.  Because they won't get the work out in a timely fashion.  They think all of their students are retarded.  Forced to be.  Look at the enrolment dates on the transcripts. I bet you simply won't find anybody who was in fact allowed to complete the qualification in the 'minimum, normal or standard time'.  It is actually required to be 2 years of work.  So you could submit it in 2 years then have 1 year of external examiantion and be done in 3 years.  Has anybody ever submittted for PhD after 2 years?  What did the University do with the thesis?  I think the University of Auckland doesn't even show the studnets the external examiners reports.  They say tehy are confidential and privately commissioned by therefore owned by the Univesrity of Auckland.  So when the Univesrity tells the student that they have their qualification (or that they don't) the student doesn't have any evidecne at all that the outcome was based on teh reports of external examiners.  There is no reason to believe that the Univesrity of Aukland is making decisions on the basis of the reports of external examiners.  Justice Toogood said that Waikato didn't have to.  The Dean gets to choose whether or not the student gets the qualification.  So if the externl says they want an oral defence then the Dean can say the external thinks they should not get the qualification.  So they write F on the transcript.  That's okay says Justice Toogood.</p>

                                <p>Apparently discovery is better now.  Tell it to Olivia's parents.  Do the have her health records yet?  Bullsh*t.  The Alan Hall thing does not particularly undermine people's confidence in the Judiciary.  The Judiciary undermines people's confidence in the Judiciary over and over and over with the idiot decisions that they make.  Still haven't paid out for abuses in state care.  Still ordering children to be handed over to state care.  No accountability.  Justice Toogood.  What was he?  Pulled out of retirement to...  Write a report saying that he saw nothing wrong with the death of an 18 year old.  Just dropped dead for no good reason in a University residential hall.  Justice Toogood sees nothing wrong.  Can't check his internet records or talk to his guild mates or whatever to pinpoint the time of death.  Rules that the Universities can enrol students in courses they never applied to.  How was he even a Judge of the HIgh Court?  Now he's doing the cycling NZ cover up.  I wonder what is in Olivia's health records..  One thing that might make sense is if the Olympic Selection thing is about people needing to pass their tox test or screen.  If you were doping your athletes then it could be the case that you need to pull the odd one because you messed up or their metabolism changed or whatever and you couldn't send them because they likely wouldn't pass the tox screen.  I don't know.  Anyway..  It is super bizarre that she would suicide all voluntary-like when she was starting to be heard.  Eh?  Super bizarre...  If she was suicidal or depressed I guess her medical records would say something about that -- right?  All the quality Medical Doctors on payroll...  I'm sure...</p>

                                <p>Corruption, hey.</p>

                                <p>I guess the end game goal or plan is to close the Universities.  Get rid of them entirely.  Wrap up the Polytech system as well.  That way they will never pay people to do skilled work because they won't acknowledge that they are skilled.  I guess you just pay a hefty bribe to whoever and do whatever you want for as  long as you get away with it.  I don't even know what to say...  They seem determined to have the Universities shut down.  Prison detention camps up and down the land.  Hospitals too...  Only treat the involuntary nonvoluntary.  They voluntarily choose to do whatever it is you force them to do else the courts will order them to.  What a f*cked up land.</p>
