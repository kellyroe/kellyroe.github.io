 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->

                            <article>

                                <p>
                                    People are lonely for community?  But it's sooooooooooo competititive!  It's sooooooooooo competitive!  It's sooooooooooo competitive.  There never will be enough to go around and people are like chickens with the pecking order and being with people is just a constant fight of 'I'm better than you' and 'I'm trying to stab you in the back' and 'I'm just  frienemy really trying to figure how to make myself look better than you'.  It's a fight for the all-important resources.  Money to pay pretty young things to do anything anything anything outside a nightclub on a Saturday night, and so on.  It's such a friendly friendly place to be, New Zealand.  Yeah, right. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                   The function of purpose of this thing they like to call 'Law', in New Zealand, appears to be a mechanism or way of the powerful to oppress others.  THe laws aren't things that protect the people or serve their interests.  The interests of community, say.  The laws are things that prevent and prohibit community by themselves simply being an expression of the depravity of those who knew in the depths of their hearts that the real meaning or purpose or function or point of life was to grubby grub grub their way up some social hierarchy where they could do anything anything anything with complete and utter impunity. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                   Nice. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Now think about what 'Medicine' and 'Healthcare' means in a nation such as this...  Ashley needs to earn half a million dollars per year  because he knows full well if he wants healthcare he will need to pay for it overseas.  International tourist rates.  If he needs an ambulance at the bottom of a cliff it's a chopper ride to Sydney, at the very least.  Assuming they have Medical Doctors.  I mean the Australian National University doesn't seem willing or able to process applications to enrol, these days.  Can't / won't supervise graduate student research (check my former supervisors email outbox for evidence to the contrary).  Can't / won't get studnets work out to externals for it to be externally examined even if it can't / won't employ anybody willing and / or able to supervise graduate student research.  I mean, if that's the state of the Australian Natioanal University, and every other University in Australasia is forced to 'get in behind' that state of affairs then it really isn't hard to see, at all, why there is no community in Australasia.  Despite their very best efforts to educate us otherwise with such gems as 'Home and Away', 'Neighbours', and 'Shortland Street'.
                                </p>

                                <p>Of course, the easiest way to win a social hierarchy competition is the 'I am the only game in town' and 'there is no alternative' and 'how low can we go' exercise or activity of trying to stabotage or undermine everybody else.  Instead of creating you can simply destroy.  And that's what we see.  THe prevention and prohibition of social development.  What was that, Sterelny?  We are all slaves to some people's selfish selfish selfish.  And the selfish that's apparently or allegedly in their genes (therefore not their fault, they can't help it, one can only suppose) ensures that everything gets overtaken and taken over by psychopaths.  For sure.  So that anything of any value doesn't actually remain for any particular length of time.  It's a f*cking miracle that there is anything at all.  Any co-operation.  Any con-munity.  Miracle.  Gee...  Better take allllllll the research funding to write about it.  The New Canberra Plan, we could call it.  The race to the bottom.  For sure.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Some things were nice about Canberra...  The problem was the lack of social conscience.  Frienemies.  Riiiiiight.  It's soooooooo fun to hang out with frienemies.  The only research game in town.  
                                </p>

                                <p>Shame New Zealand doesn't really have journals...  Research outputs.  But they're supposed to get in behind, there.  I suppose there's a faint dim hope that people might get airlifted to Sydney for Medical Treatment.  But I don't know why we would think that there would be any Medical Treatment in Sydney.  I mean, if Canberra can't process applications to enrol, can't train people at Univesrity, can't get work to external examiners, then what hope is there for the rest of Australasia?  It takes the rocks from out the ground...  And it hands them over.  For sure.  The only game in town.</p>

                                <p>Apparently it is 'not appropriate' for Aaron Perkins to represent me in a legal matter.  Hmm.  What does that mean?  I have asked him to state his conflict.  I'm sure I don't need to explain his professional duties to him.  I'm sure he knows what his professional duties are.  I'm sure he knows what things like 'Law' and 'justice' mean, in New Zealand.  </p>

                                <p>Garbage garbage garbage garbage garbage garbage outputs.  Hey...  What complete and utter garbage.  Hey...  </p>

                                <p>Did you know that the Univerities of New Zealand can say that you were enrolled (and invoice your student loan for fees) for courses that you *never applied to be enrolled in*.  Wow.  Hey, check in with the IRD everyone.  About what courses the Universities of New Zealand may have recorded you enrolled in.  Maybe you think you don't need to worry because you never even applied to go to University.  That doesn't matter, though.  Apparently they choose.  They choose what (if any) courses are right for them to bill for you..  They choose.  They choose.  They choose.  That's how we have the Medical, Legal, and Engineering workforce that we have today.  The slavery model of business where you force people to work and they don't pay (or where you force people to work and to also pay you for the work that they do)  Etc.  What kind of gaslighting is this?  Indeed... </p>

                                <p>The social engineering experiment in the lack of society.  The lack of engineering.  What happens when there is no education or health or law or anything anything anything at all.  Right Sterelny?  Think about all the things of meaning and value of which there is none of.  Nothing.   Nada.  NOthing to see people.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  Who wants to party party party with the administration?  Strange how pedophiles like community.  Right?  Wrongful deathbringers?  They quite like to spend time with people, too.  Such community.  There for the taking.  Right?  Who wouldn't want to get in there and take take take take take.  It's sooooo fun.  No??  Well then.  Starve the people into compliance.  Whatever.  It's fun to be the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff because then it's 'my way or the highway' where the highway is literally being left to die.  And the point or the purpose of Medicine is killing as many as possible 'aw, at least we tried, it's sooooooo competitive'.  That's the only thing that makes any sense, really.  Of why it's soooooo competitive for all the selfish.    </p>

                                <p>I suppose the thing of it is 'wah wah wah wah wah I didn't get to do what it was that I really wanted to do -- and there was no hope for me -- therefore I am now going to take that out on everybody else by similarly forcing everybody else to not get to do what it is that they really want to do as well'.  That explains why it is that people are all so very very up in everybody else's business.  Doing the needs assessments so that once they have identified what people need they can be more effective in preventing and probibiting and obstructing and denying and so on.  Meaning of life, right there.  Right?  Are we having fun yet?  Is it fun to party party party party party with people who have power to decide what happens with your life?  Why are they so up in your life for?  Why don't they 'live and let live'...  Because their success is tied to your demise, apparently.  Unless you partake in their selfish genes or something like that.  Riiiiiight.  It's sooooooo competitive.  Selfish selfish psychopaths con-municators...  Are we having fun yet?  What fun?  These people are supposed to lead...  Uh..  Lead us where?  To what?  Where are we going?  Forget aspirational goals...  You need frontal lobe capacity for that.  It's like Australasia was lobotomised at the door, or something.  It doesn't make any sense.  Hey.  </p>

                                <p>What social services?  What community?  The great con-munity.  Sure.  People see that.  Who loves con-munity?  It takes a type.  Oh yes, indeed, it does.  One who likes to go on 'trade mission' apparently.  Blackbird for lackeys...  Don't get sick now, y'hear.</p>

                                <p>So..  Why say about hacking the Medical Insurer for congenital conditions...  Well..  Obviously most of the 'congenital conditions' are actually 'medical misadverntures' you would call them in the developed world.  We have a 'no fault' policy to try and attract the worst of the incompetent and psychopathic health workers from all over the world.  Putting that out there.  The shining beacon motivating and inspiring those who want to run run run away from the world that has a somewhat functioning legal system.  Where prosecutors actually prosecute occasionally.  And where the wrongdoer actully has to pay compensation to victims.  Millions sometimes.  Hahahahaha silly silly silly.  We don't have that concept or conception at all.  No law.  No justice.  No fairness.  No integrity.  Honesty.  Meaning.  Value.  Nothing to see here, people.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  Can't process an application unless it's from someone seeking to do anything anything anything 'no fault'.  So, anyway, the medical misadventures around conception and pre-natal and around the birth and shortly thereafter.  Where things are recorded as being 'congenital' rather than the fault or responsibility of the psychopaths.  Squeezing and pulling too hard with the forceps etc.  Medically inducing premature delivery or stillbirth.  For the practice.  The early surgeries or treatments.  The trading of parts.  No fault 'medical' system.  Step up step up step up!!! For the magical mystery tour!!  It doesn't take partiuclarly much imagination to understnd why they REFUSE TO PROCESS MY APPLICATION TO ENROL.</p>

                                <p>Not even a teeny tiny hint of 'try'.  The great con-munity.  Yeah.  Right.  The great con.  That's for sure.  The land for cons.  That's for sure.  By design.  And it's been internalised and embraced by those hand picked out to be leaders for all the qualities that are valued to lead in these parts.  One can only suppose...</p>

                                <p>Many people were born here through no fault of their own.  Righ.  The 'no fault' land with no functioning Judiciary.  Where is Una?  Has she stopped destroying evidence yet?  Or is the plan to intentionally use non-secure software systems etc and then claim that 'hackers' are changing the records.  Recording that people are criminals or that they failed certain courses at university or that they have congenital conditions or that they are vulnerable people.  No fault.  No responsibility.  What fun.  Are we having fun?  Party party party.  It's all for the con-munity.  Selfish selfish selfish.  Sooooooo competitive...</p>

                                <p>'They say' that people are lonely.  That people are lonely for con-munity.  Who says?  Who says that people are lonely?  THe same people who say that people in the hospital are volunteers?  They voluntarily phoned up St Johns requeseting to be detained in an ambulance outside the hospital.  They voluntarily chose to be in-patients of the hospital.  They voluntarily chose to be sectioned against their will.  That's what volunteering means.  Taking one for the team.  The same people who say that our 'hospital' is filled with 'volunteers' who are 'volunteering their time' to help the progression and developmetn of the 'medical misadventures' training programme or 'you pay us to do anything anything anything without liability' programme...  Those people?  Are those the people who say that people are lonely?  I expect so.  Some people are verrrrrrrrry determined that others are lonely.  Others would voluntarily prefer to live with them in their basement living off of their scraps.  Like a blow up doll they could take out and force to comply in this that and the other respect whever they want.  That's how most people are.  Right?  Lonely for wanting some master to tell them what to do when to do it and so on.  That's how people are.  They are loney.  Yeah.  Right.  Bolting their doors (that's why they remove the bolts from the doors) because they know better than the people just how lonely the people are.  Yeah.  Right.</p>

                                <p>
                                    Anyway...  The 'Universities' can get back to wasting people's time in person, now.  Bullying them out of their work etc.  I mean, people will still pay the university pay the university pay the univesity pay the university if they want to be doctors or nurses or engineers.  If they want to be teachers or lawyers.  Judges.  Physiotherapists.  'Skilled workers'.  And, of course, the Govermment is setting up a prevention and prohibitino of skilled workers trade school to ensure that we don't have any plumbers or electricians and so on.  So that we don't have anything anythign anything at all.  Rather, the people struck off from overseas for incompetence or inepitutude can be sent here.  THe great con.  For all the cons.  The convicts.  The great detention prison camp of Australia.  Who can't parse the constitution that states quite clearly that NZ is a state of Australia.  A prison camp of Australia.  Of course.  Because Canberra is such a wonderful place...  Where people keep their families in Sydney or Melbourne, say, and fly in and do 'business' and party party party.  Such a wondeful place with little to no social conscience.  Such wonderful frienemies who, apparently, are what community means.  Right.  Why didn't the wonderful Sterelny supervise me the way he supervised his other studnets?  Did other studnets work go out to external examiners?  Did he tell them when to submit it?  How late were they requried to work?  Did they have to house-sit for him?  How many times?  Why don't I miss the community...  Gee....  I wonder...  Why didn't I feel like dressing up for all the photos of all the pretty girls arriving at the parties...  I wonder...  Why didn't they get my research to external examiners?  I don't wonder.  Sterelny said I should have a good hard think about how there isn't anything in NZ which is where I will go if I sulk and don't put on a pretty party dress.. Selfish selfish selfish.  Lonely, you say.  Yeah.  Right.
                                </p>

                                <p>There is and are other people in the world.  The worst of them grubitty grub their way up the hierarchy because it's important to them for all the things that they value.  But that's why people don't have access to healthcare etc.  Because it's sooo competitive and the selfish f*cks won't allow the people to have healthcare.  Autonomy.  Etc.  They don't see people.  They see blow up dolls or puppets.  Yes sir yes sir anything you say sir.  And so there isn't anything for anybody else.</p>
