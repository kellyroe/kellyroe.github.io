                            <p>
                            The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications.  They define a 120 point program of study (e.g., the 120 point MPhil program of study that I applied to be enrolled in) as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a>.  The Universities of New Zealand refuse to accept this, however, and the Courts sided with the Universities.  They believe they are entitled to withhold qualification completions and force re-enrolments in order to collect more momey from the student for re-enrolment and in order to obtain more and more money from the Government or external funders for them keeping the student-slave.  They are not allowing graduate research students to complete their qualifications in timely fashions.  They are forcing continued labor without pay.  They do this with vocational training, also, withholding qualification completions so as to withhold pay.  The New Zealand Government is the major employer.  The New Zealand Government chooses to keep slaves.

                            The University of Otago (1) refuses to supply applications to some candidates (2) throws away applications from some candidates prior to assessing the application on it's merits (3) collects up disability information prior to selection for purposes of exclusion only (there is no equity pathway for disability).  The High Court of New Zealand has found that there is nothing legally wrong with the public University of Otago choosing to conduct it's business in this manner.  I filed with the Court of Appeal but they refuse to progress my filings because I did not have $7,060 to pay the security for costs amount required by the courts.  The University of Otago chose to require me to bring this to the courts.  The Univesrity of Otago chose not to put things right internally.  The present Univesrsity of Otago Vice Chancellor chooses not to put things right internally.  They believe they are entitlted to select whomever they want for whatever program they want for whatever arbitrary reasons they want.  I post my filings with the Court of Appeal here.  You may want to consider this situation (with the Univesrity of Otago and also with the Courts of New Zealand) very carefully before you decide whether you want to do business with New Zealand:
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  The Justice for the High Court Proceedings was one who seems to have been pulled out of retirement for the occasion.  The government chooses to get judges out of retirement rather than appointing new judges.  I do not know if the judges grand-son or great grand-son was offered a place in a program (or graduation from a program) for his role in the proceedings.  Was offered a reference for his application to Harvard.  Decide for yourself the value of a University of Otago Degree. 
                            </p>


                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings on grounds that it had already passed judgment on the filings and would not revisit the issue.  They did not think my filings sufficient to show there had been a grotesque injustice in how they handled my filings.  I post them here so you can judge for yourself.

                            <p>
                            The Australian Constition says that New Zealand is a State of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  
                            New Zealand is listed as one of the original states of the federation of Australia.  It states that New Zealand has not been asked to be part of the Commonwealth, and it has not consented, but it is expedient to regard it to be a part of the Commonwealth.  It is declared to be part of the Commonwealth.  There has not been a referendum or whatever needs to happen to alter the constitution to have New Zealand removed from it's status as part of the Constitution of Australia.  As such, I don't see how it is lawful for Australia to require New Zealanders to have Australian Visas.  I don't see how it is lawful for Australia to remove visas and deport New Zealanders anymore than it would be lawful for Australia to remove Australian passport from people from Melborne and refuse to allow them entry to any state outside Victoria.  I don't see how it is lawful for New Zealand to have a separate currency.  The point or purpose of which seems only to be to disguise how low wages are kept, for the majority of New Zealanders.  I don't see how it is lawful for the NZ Government to refuse to hand over Federal tax funding and to refuse to uphold building regulations etc that have been set by the Federal Government of Australia.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The State of New Zealand does have a Treaty with Maaori.  I don't see how this undermines New Zealand being a State of Australia.  New Zealand does not have representation in the Parliament of Australia because Australia refuses to acknowledge New Zealanders as Australians.  They refuse to uphold their own constitution.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The Universities of Otago and Auckland are not being fair as to how they are choosing what students to enrol in Medicine.  It wasn't that Dr Leeks (Dr Green etc) happened to slip through a selection criterion or process objectively and fairly applied.  It was that he or they was or were hand-picked or specially chosen for demonstrating all the qualities it is that they value.  I suppose, then, Dr Leeks was transferred to Melborne because that is also what they value over there.  I don't see what else we are supposed to think about that when they harbor him they way they have chosen to.  They are not even trying to be fair.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The Universities and courts have broken the social contract.  The Courts have chosen to set precedent that it will cost upwards of $20,000 to take a case against the University to the High Court, and even then they work to delay and obstruct and prohibit and prevent justice.  
                            </p>

                            <p>This website was set up so that I could put most of my academic work on here (the work I can find).  Because I have not been credited appropriately for my work, over the years.  I have done considerable amounts of graduate research work, particularly, and the people who were paid to help me worked only to undermine and stabotage me, insofar as I can see.
                            </p>

                            <p> I put in an application to start another PhD with the ANU last year (since they haven't acknowledged tht I have done enough for a PhD already) to see what would happen with my application.  When I applied I said I was not really interested in starting over from the beginning again, and was more interested in recieving credit for the work I had done for them already.  What seemed fair?  My application was declined.  I don't think it likely that the new applicants to start their PhD were more highly qualified than me.  With respect to their GPA and their writing samples and their publications and their experience giving seminars etc.  I mean to say, they don't seem to be making academic decisions on the basis of academic merits.  They seem to be trying to select the newest generation of slaves.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Otago has recently claimed that a reason why graduation was cancelled and we didn't see any research students publically credited with having completed their research qualification was because they received threats of violence from a former student.  It does occur to me 'there is no excuse for threats of violence'.  But it also occurs to me that there is no excuse for how Otago has chosen to treat it's students.  What options are there for students or employees or slaves or volunteers when people who have kept them working or studying do not honor terms and when the courts refuse to uphold the law?  It might be possible to escape...  1/4 of the population of New Zealand has fled.  I find myself thinking 'it's the brain drain' and I find myself thinking about the brain drain 'if you have any brains then you will flee far away from here'.  And I find myself then thinking about flocks of migrants who are treated horribly everywhere they go.  False promises of a better life and then being kept as second or third class citizens.  And I wonder why it is that those who are wronged should be forced to flee and why it is that those who are doing the wrongs should  be allowed to persist in their wrongs.     
                               </p>

                               <p>
                                The Education and Training Act 2020 and the Education Acts prior to that all stated that domestic adults who had attained the age of 20 years were eligible to  be enrolled in the programme they applied to.  They stated that teenagers (under the age of 20 years) were able to be enrolled by the University only if the University was satisfied that they were able to complete the course.  So, when we hear of a Univerity being satisfied enough that a teenager could complete the course so as to enrol them and take their money and we then hear of the University failing them for their course not only once, but two years in a row, then it really looks like the University has some explaining to do as to how it was that they could not pass the student.  The High Court of Dunedin did not see it that way because the Judges don't seem willing or able to understand justice.  They appear to be some combination of unwilling or unable to do their job. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The New Zealand Government has chosen to create and impose incentive structures incentivising slavery.  Preventing and prohibiting the development of training systems and skilled labor.  
                                </p>

                                <p>New Zealand does not necessarily have a shortage of people with skills.  It (1) refuses to enrol people with capacity (2) refuses to progress people with capacity (3) refuses to graduate people with capacity (4) refuses to publically advertise jobs (5) refuses to hire people with capacity to do the jobs (6) refuses to pay them.  It determinedly refuses to allow skilled work to be done.  Once the managers and administrators have taken up all the money they think they are worth and they think they are entitled to they still think they are entitled to keep slaves or hostages.  Apparently there just isn't enough money left for everybody else.

                                I wrote my thesis for Waikato before Covid.  My views on immunisation have changed after seeing how various things unfolded with Covid etc.  My views on the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People and the relationship between that and the Treaty of Waitangi etc have also evolved.  After I was not given any credit or acknowledgement or funding to have worked on my Masters research (which was apparently an area that was high priority at the time -- which seems to be code-speak for off limits or not allowed or most unwanted) various other people have been paid rather a lot to...  Take my ideas and pass them off as their own?  Is that the idea of it?  Take the work of the Masters students.  Flunk out the Masters students.  Get the $90,000 a year Government Employees to pass that work off as their own?  That sounds about right.  The scholarship funding is, often, not getting to the students.  The reason they ask you to do research grant applications or funding proposals or even submitting engineering design plans or submitting things for intellectual property or submitting things for business grants etc...  They decline you funding for your idea.  Then they steal your idea and pass it off as their own.  If you bring anything to them for patient or whatever then they will shut you down and steal it for themselves.  There isn't any way for those kinds of things to function, here.

                                Who wins the election makes no difference in New Zealand.  The Administration does not change (things re-structure and they get shoulder-tapped for a new job with a comparable or even higher salary). The rich-list of 'public-servants' does not change they just move them around.  'Election' is mere window-dressing.  We have seen what was required for a change in the leadership in Samoa...  Tonga...  What will it take for Australia and New Zealand to get with the Development Program already? 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                At times I find myself wondering if they are intellectually handicapped.  They can't parse their own constitution.  They can't repeat back what the statute said.  They can't parse the Univesrity Calendar Regulations.   And then I think that isn't very nice of me to think (you should be ashamed!)  And then I think about the various intellectually handicapped people who I have met, over the years, and they would never do any of these sorts of things that our supposed leaders do. It is that something entirely different is what is going on with the leadership. 

                               <p>Distinguish (1) costs.  (2)  Legal fees (the 2/3rds rule).  (3)  What the lawyer invoices the client.  New Zealand judiciary serves to punish the victims by delivering judgments that punish the victims for having complained and having brought their complaints before the courts.  They mostly won't even award costs to the party who was wronged.  But even if they do award costs, they won't award legal fees.  But even if they do award legal fees they won't recompense them so as not to be left out of pocket for the total amount of the legal expenses.  That is to say the courts decide to take a chunk out of the victims because there is no justice.  The judiciary doesn't appear to have the conception of justice, at all.  They will not do it.  Won't do it.

                                <p>
                                New Zealand obviously does not have a functioning judiciary.

Is to find or create the next Dr Leeks.  I imagine Dr Leeks did not complain, overly, about the not fit for purpose buildings. I imagine Dr Leeks did not complain, overly, about wanting a pay-rise.  I imagine Dr Leeks was likely very charming to his superiors.  All 'yes sir, no problems, sir, nothing to see here, sir.'  Quite the model employee.  I'm sure that if Dr Leeks wanted more money he found ways to be entrepunureal.  Selling children or renting them or or similar.  If that is the way things are in New Zealand (and that is the way that those in power want New Zealand to be) then they are not legitmate rulers or leaders, at all.  They have broken the social contract.

                                There is no 'ethical dilemma'  between 'educational opportunities' on the one hand, and upholding informed consent (treating the patient with dignity), on the other.  This is because you are not teaching students how to perform intimate examinations or surgeries when you are requiring the students perform sexual and physical assaults.  If you don't know the difference between an intimate exam and a physical or sexual assault then you need to stand down.  When you require students to perform sexual and physical assaults then that is what you are, in fact, doing.  And that is all that you are, in fact, doing.  That is not Medical Training.  That is ordering people to commit atrocities.  This is a problem with having a Medical Training Cohort full of teenagers who are also taught that they are to follow orders to commit atrocities and that if they do not do this then they will be failed out of their training.  Apparently some of Nazi's would sing triumphant songs as the people were marched (by them) into death chambers.  Nobody ordered them to sing triumphant songs.  I'm sure they are doing their level best to identify the Medical Students most likely to sing trumphant songs while performing sexual and physical assaults.  I don't know if these people are more or less likely to participate in survey.  My inclination is to believe 'less likely'.  I would imagine these people shy most away from documentation.  Must  have.

                                I don't see how Australia has any claim to be rule of or by law.  They refuse to uphold the laws, as written.  They refuse to base academic decisions on the basis of academic reasons, insofar as I can see.  Politicians think that they can throw their weight around ordering anything they like to happen to and with whatever community they like and they aren't accountable, at all.  They simply refuse to count whoever they don't want to count (they declare them 'ineligible') and refuse to supply voting papers or whatever.  I don't see how it is possible for good people to function in Australasia.

                                New Zealand won't list ingredients properly on food.  New Zealand won't do the proper food safety testing so as to (for example) shut down a plant in a timely fashion, if bacteria or similar were to be found.  New Zealand would think nothing of a death of 4 babies as a cost of doing business.  So it's hard to get the USA interested in our infant formula, and various other things.  We just won't do it.  Refuse to get with the program.  Not going to happen.

                                The Court of Appeal decided that it would give people the Government chooses to keep on welfare an `unfair advantage in litigation' if they were to dispense with the usual security for costs.  As such, they ordered Ms Roe to pay more than $20,000 in security for costs for the cases to be heard on appeal.  Otherwise, the cases were deemed to have been abandoned.  That is to say, even though Ms Roe did everything she was required to do to have the cases heard on appeal, the courts would say they had been abandoned because Ms Roe hadn't paid more than $20,000 security for costs that had been ordered by the courts for her to have paid.  Did the courts see fit to alter the amount in question given that Ms Roe is kept by the government on less than minimum wage while the people whose behavior Ms Roe is complaining is in violation of statutory law of New Zealand are each on considerable excess of $250,000 per year?  Not only that,  but where there legal representation (major firms and queens council) is paid for by the government as a perk of their job so that they don't even try and sort things out internally via internal complaints resolution.  They do everything they possibly can to delay and obstruct and prevent and prohibit things  being sorted out internally.

                                We recently learned that it's okay to chop a finger off in self defence.  I suppose that the lesson is that if you don't like being sexually abused then you have the courts permission to chop off the genitals of your abuser or their hands or whatever seems appropriate.  That is how justice works in New Zealand given that the courts choose to violate the social contract.  Let the court of popular opinion decide, then.  What is appropriate for the people who the Government chooses to keep on excess of $200,000 per year payroll with legal defense as a perk of their job such that they feel entitled to use internal complaints resolution not to de-escalate and sort out in a timely fashion but to try and breed terrorists, I suppose.  For how long am I supposed to follow instructions to follow internal and external (court) complaints resolution policy and procedure while the people kept on excess of $200,000 salaries (including the judges) don't appear willing and / or able to do any of the things that they are paid to do.  Uphold the laws.  For example.  Get the work to the examiner.  For example.  Calculate the GPA according to the published algorithm.  For example.  Get the applications to the medical admissions committee so that the committee can decide (and not you Peter Crampton, for example.  Much as we know you for all the work you do furthering the cause of Maaori which is very Big of you since you immigrated here from the UK when you were 12.  Very big of you to make their cause your own and decide which of the applications get to go before the Medical Admissions Committee.  I see why they choose to pay you.

                                The Supreme Court did not think it appropriate to reduce the amount of costs since Ms Roe earns less than average wage.  The judicial process chose to accuse Ms Roe of bringing cases before the court that would not be pursued by 'reasonable and solvent litigant' and chose to deliver their 'opinion' over and over and over and over that the case had no merit.  They would not do that if Ms Roe had simply paid them the money.  But since Ms Roe did not pay them the money (since the Government chooses not to pay Ms Roe) the Judiciary chose to get on the bandwagon, there, and say that they werent' denying justice to Ms Roe.  Justice for Ms Roe looks like her case being forced abandoned because it has no merit.  SHe is not a slave to the courts even she is forced to abandon everything!  Slave or die, Ms Roe!

                                Ms Roe filed with the Benefits Review Committee that Work and Income (the Ministry of the Prevention and Prohibition of Social Development) should give her an advance benefit payment since the Supreme Court of New Zealand has declared it would give litigants an 'unfair advantage in litigation' if the usual security for costs amount were to be reduced or dispensed with.  The Benefits Reviews Committee couldn't get much past 'no essential need declined' reasoning after delaying everything for months beyond their documented timeframes for them doing their work.  So Ms Roe files with the Social Security Tribunal.  Who says 'nonononononono we did not receive your paper filing submissions.

                                I have just been informed that the Tribunal is now acknowledging they have received my electronic filings for review of the Benefit Review Committee decision that justice is declined because 'not essential need'.  I have been informed that the Ministry gets an extension on their filings (they get 5 weeks and 3 days) because they didn't have people available to work on a couple of those days.  Then there is a telephone conference.  I am not sure on the reason for the telephone conference.  I think it is just to set the delay timer over again before they schedule a hearing.  It is like they get more and more and more and more and more money for more and more and more and more delay.  Does this seem like a justice system or like the prevention and prohibition of a justice system?

                                The question is 'how can you work with people and animals ethically IN ORDER TO produce meaningful results'?  Torturing things harms them and damages them.  You don't need to do experiments to discover that.  It is cruel to break things so you can claim to fix them.  Get good.  Git gud.  As teh kids say.  Breaking something in order to fix it isn't clever.  It's disingenuous.  There aren't enough actual problems in the actual f*cking world, people think they have to go about making everything worse.  The waste of f*cking spaces that took up people's time and energy and efforts...  That diverted and hijacked things from better projects.  The pursuit of evil.  Trying to bring hell on earth.  Delay and prevent and prohibit and obstruct...  The prevention and prohibition of development agenda.  I don't think most people can comprehend the cruelty.  The lengths some people will go to in order to have a group of people or animals or both that they can treat as slaves.  It isn't a science department or a psychology department or even an animal research laboratory.  It is the prohibition and prevention of such things.  It is people with no capacity or ability to do good work getting in the way of people with capacity getting on with the job.

                                <p>Hey, here is an idea.  The New Zealand Government can just imprison whoever they want for whatever arbitrary reason they want.  Then they can refuse to acknowledge foreign qualifications and refuse to grant domestic qualifications such that there isn't anybody on payroll as lawyer or as doctor.  Then the judge (or proxy) can order a 'fitness to stand trial' psychiatric assessment to be conducted before there be a trial.  Then the trial can be delayed indefinately since there won't be a psych assessment since there isn't anybody on payroll to do that job.  That's a great idea!  They could keep..  What percentage of the population sounds good?  Living in institutions?  Feeding them..  They can live off of less than $1 a day on food?  Does that seem right?  You can put them to 'work' in the prisons -- right?  Isn't that win-win.  You could give the Polytech's more than $1,000 per week regardless of whether they applied to be enrolled in an education programme or not.  I mean, Roe v Univeristy of Waikato current precedent is that the University didn't do anything wrong in having enrolled (and invoiced Ms Roe's student allowance for) courses she never even applied to be enrolled in.  Then you get them filling out a questionare where 'I read the newspaper every day' means they are a liar / sociopath.  Or 'I sometimes feel anxious' means you get to feed them LSD at which point they have 'brief episodic psychosis'.  Sounds like a great idea/l for the prevention and prohibition of development, doesn't it?  Shouldn't we get right on that?  I hear that there doesn't need to be an agency behind development.  But since development is the default trajectory you really have to wonder who or what is preventing and prohibiting development when there isn't development...  I don't understand how Jacinda can go to graduation at Harvard when New Zealand doesn't even acknowledge foreign qualifications (or domestic qualifications).  Or maybe it is just my qualifications that aren't acknowledged.  I mean, I can't even write a passable first year essay for a first year University course in Population Health with the University of Auckland ffs.  I mean...  I must be illiterate.  Right?  No speak English.

                                The attorney general of New York (and various other people) sued the NRA back in 2020.  Turns out that various people are bullied and made fun of.  Excluded.  Shunned.  People aren't kind to them.  People are soooooooo competitive that they think it's fun or entertaining for them to mock others and it's a happy day when they see people being eliminated or excluded.  Ignore requests for help.  Repeatedly ignore requests for help.  Turns out the longer term consequences...  Well, what are you supposed to do?  Not allowing people to defend themselves against the communities that treated them so badly...  That's a difficult thing.  I don't think that New Zealand has done so well keeping terrorist attacks to a minimum because of our gun laws.  New Zealand's geographical position in the world meant the people didn't have access to the guns.  People in New Zealand don't have the capacity to design or manufacture guns and they are difficult to get here, from overseas.  But the US is increasing the supply of guns, it seems, as is Australia.  So that New Zealanders have the tools they need to feel heard in New Zealand, given the current climate.  Every time the New Zealand Government fails to meet one of their processing deadlines, every time they don't publically advertise a public servant job, every time they give it to their lack of capacity friend of family, every time they don't pay their workers fair wages...  It's all ammunition.  People really don't like living in this nasty little despot.  The people really can't be any clearer.  The Government will not listen.  Nope.  Not going to.  5 weeks for the Ministry of Social Development to explain why justice 'no essential need'.

                                Every time they delay and obstruct and prevent and prohibit htey are inciting acts of terrorism.  The courts refuse to deliver justice in a timely fashion.  They are inciting acts of terrorism.  When teh Dunedin judge refused to hold Otago accountable for failing students that judge was inciting acts of terrorism.  New Zeealand:  Doing everything it can to produce terrorists.  Because Jacinda likes to go 'awwwwwwwwww feel better'.  She thinks it makes her look good.

                                    Around 2 years ago we were informed that Jacinda was given more than $200,000 by Harvard as a gift, for some reason.  She announced that it would be converted into a Scholarship for a Student.  A 2 year Masters in Leadership.  Now we hear that she was given an 'Honorary Degree' (I suppose because she did not write a thesis or submit any work for examination) but it gave her something to wear (other than her University of Waikato Con-Munication Degree Robe) so she could stand up before the people of Harvard and tell them how she consoles herself by thinking of people who speak out about her publically as social outcasts.

                                <p>
                                And the value of a Harvard Degree is...  Uh...  Well...  What are we supposed to think, right now?  The obvious point is that you don't pay to go to Harvard -- they pay you.  And look at who they choose to pay...  I suppose the students had various questions they wanted to ask her about various things.  Electoral donations.  Why there weren't jobs for them in New Zealand.  Why New Zealand won't give procurement contracts to former graduates etc.  Why the government sees fit to choose to pay people without the capcity to prevent and prohibit their jobs being done by anyone.  Where Chris Whelan is to do a quality and integrity audit on the Jacinda Ardern Leadership Degree from Harvard (at the value of more than $200,000 per year.  To be awarded to a student.  Jacinda said.  Herself.  She meant.  I wonder what year she applied to study at Harvard...  I can't wait to read all the work that she sent them.  Wow.  I wonder if she uploaded it to Turnitin...)
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I mean...  At the end of the day.  We make the executive decision to...  Invest in armed guards.  And build another prison.  We choose not to invest in school counsellors...  We choose not to invest in programmes that help people who aren't fitting in go into programmes where they do get to fit in.  We choose to invest in gun violence, I suppose.  What better spokesperson for terrorism...  The gun manufacturers want a new market...  Who will help them sell guns?  Jacinda...  She proclaimed to Harvard that every politician was on the take, in New Zealand.  Wouldn't have gotten in without donations.  So...  Why not get in on the back of the US gun lobby?  Great idea.  Best country in the world in which to do business.  Don't have to worry about the lawyers of NZ making a case that the NRA is a fraud on all it's people (don't piss off the gun lobby, NRA tisk tisk).

                                Oh.  No, they gave her a doctorate.  She didn't write them a thesis, but they gave her an honorary doctorate.  So now everybody knows the value of a doctorate from Harvard.  You don't apply to be enrolled in the program, you don't attend the courses, you don't do the work involved in the examinations, you don't have work examined, you just get given a doctorate.  So now people know not to bother applying to do a doctorate from Harvard.  Don't call Harvard, Harvard calls you.  What do they call you?  Doctor.  Well, then, we don't need Psychiatrists, in NZ.  Jacinda can sign off on all the involuntary detentions she wants.  I mean, she's a doctor, now, right?

                                <p>
                                I mean it's a terrific decision, isn't it?  To do a big f*cking sh*t all over the New Zealanders who worked hard for various things.  Who worked hard on their Univeristy assignments, and the like.  For them to be failed out of their courses, failed out of their degree qualifications...  While Jacinda Ardern just gets handed a PhD for doing...  Uh...  For doing...  I can't think of anything more likely to incite acts of terrorism within New Zealand.  I can't think of anything more likely to induce people from New Zealand to travel to Housten and buy guns and try and take down either the people at Harvard, or the people from NZ Universities, or the people within the NZ government, or all of the above.  That seems to be the cunning plan.  I mean...  I can't think of anything more likely to incite acts of terrorism or gun violence than any of that...  Can you think of anything?  Let's hear it think-tank?  What do you think the think-tanke message is?  
                                </p>

                                <p>Harvard always was...  Underwealming.  When I met people from Harvard I always thought they worked at a mid-tier place...  Was surprised to learn they worked at Harvard.  The students, also.  I remember various people I was impressed by.  I remember being impressed by various people.  None of them were Harvard people.  I always remember being really very unimpressed and underwealmed by Harvard people.  I suppose this is just the latest iteration of that.  They do well with their marketing and their branding.  I suppose.  But then they go and give PhD's...  The class of 2022...  To people who didn't attend their 2 years of course-work.  Who didn't write, for them, a thesis, at all...  They just hand them a PhD.  And that is the value of a PhD from Harvard.  The title.  None of the work.  Benefiting from none of the teaching.  Learning from none of the peers in your class.  Experiencing none of the connections.  Just given a 'you are now a doctor, congradualations!'  You are not a real doctor.  Not a real doctor, at all.  You have none of the knowledge.  None of the experience.  None of the work.  ANd the people who did the work.  Who got the experience...  Failed out -- right?  So that you could have the qualification instead of them.  Riiiiiiight.  Greeeeeeeat.  The qualification is totally something worth wwanting (riiiiiight). It's all about the people who you did not meet..  suuuuuure.  Awwwww...  I'm so glad I got to train at the ANU in Philsoophy.  With all of the people working in Philosophy.  All the people who valued Philosophy.  Who worked in Philosophy.  Who progressed the work in Philsoophy.  Yeah.  Right.

                                So, like, Jacinda...  If you were enrolled in a PhD in..  Um..  The Jacinda Ardern Scholarship in Leadership Programme..  In the class of 2022...  Then that means that 5 years prior, in your first year you would have been enrolled in...  The following courses...  Right???  witha cohort??  Yeah???  And your teachers would have been....  ANd a whole cohort would have learned alongside you.  And you would have profited from certain professors introducting you to various ideas.  And you would probably have meet with your peer so you could discuss those ideas.  Wow, you went to Harvard.  That means you probably know about the local pizza places and the coffee shops...  The local bars...  Wow...  You are totally clued into all the social networks...  My idol.  HOw terrifying was sittiing your breadth exam, Jacinda?  The breadth of knowledge exam in your chosen field of study?  Did you have to work really really hard?  Pull all nighters?  Did you have a fun study group?  A great group of people you collaborated with so that all of you could pass and progress together as a cohort?  How about your in depth exam?  Where is your theiss Jacinda??
                                </p>

                                Ah, a doctor of law.  One of those 'High Value Degrees'.  Not a JD.  Because she didn't pay a bunch of money and / or she actually does not know (did not enroll in, was not exposed to, did not learn anything)...  One upon a time a Masters degree was appropriate.  For example:  there was a Prime Minster: Palmer.  Who had a son:  Palmer.  Palmer Junior was given a Masters Degree in Law from Yale.  He returned to NZ to devote his career to ensuring that Judicial Review of Administrative Action was an Archaic Law with No Teeth because Daddy could do whatever Daddy wanted done (as Prime Minister) and the Judiciary (son) couldn't do anything about that.  Welcome to NZL.  But things are moving on, times are changing...  So now Jacinda gets a PhD in something useful -- Law.  I see the State of NY doesn't require law degree for people to work as lawyers in the state.  For obvious reason.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Thinktank:  Alright...  Here is what we are going to do...  During a time when the Universities of NZ are  publically shown to be refusing to progress applications to enrol, refusing to progress qualifications, refusing to confer degrees...  We are going to grant the Prime Minister an 'honorary degree'.  That's the think-tank idea.  And the NZ people are supposed to respond -- how?  What is the likely response?  What is the desired response?  What is the aim here?  What is the goal?
