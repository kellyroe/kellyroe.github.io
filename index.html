                            <p>
                            The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications.  They define a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a> 
                            </p>

                           <p>Australasian Universities believe they are entitled to simply refuse to process or progress students work, however.  Take it to court, they say.  Then the courts refuse to progress filings.   
                            </p>

                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  They aren't progressing the filings.
                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  
                                </p> 

                            <p>
                            It seems to me that the Australian Constition explicitly states that New Zealand is regarded, by them, to be a State of the Federation of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  Australia refuses to honor it's own Constitution. 
                            </p>

                            <p>Here are  <a href="judicial-review/sup-court-waikato.pdf" target="_self"> My Filings </a>to the Supreme Court regarding the University of Waikato    
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            New Zealand and Australia choose to enslave their people.  Slavery.  Bonded servitude.  Voluntary work.  I'm supposed to voluntarily donate all my time filing and refiling and refiling and refiling with the courts, now.  For no pay.  While they count more and more and more costs against me.  Ordering delay and refilings and so on.  They won't pay the workers.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            They also don't train the students.  The training programmes.  They just put the studnets to some approximation of work and that is all the 'work' there is.  All my research work.  I started research 'work' with a third year directed study.  More research during Honors.  Then 2 master and a PhD.  Only credit for 1 masters.  Actually no credit, now, because degrees expire, apparently.  5 years post-graduation degrees aren't acnowledged as being worth anything.  They are especially designed so as to teaching you nothing that survives 5 years post-graduation.  That's the value they put on their own degrees.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            When it's time for them to graduate you and pay you then it's time for you to go away.  Disowned.  Not acknowledged.  They keep slave or detention camps only.  Designed to waste your time only.  Wastrels.  They choose to keep people as wastrels.  They have no interest, at all, in developing the eduacation system or the health sysetm.  No interest in providing quality education or training or employment.  It's all a scummy scam.  Seems to me to be.  I put the work I've done here.  Apparently I haven't done enough for credit for a PhD.  I haven't done enough for entry to Medicine (that one requires you to be 18 and hand-picked for most likely to be a pedophile rapist best I can figure from their decisions to choose and harbor people like Dr Money and Dr Leeks).
                            </p>

                            <p>The courts refuse to deliver timely justice.  They won't progress the filings and deliver a just verdict.  There's nothing in Australasia.  People don't choose to come here.  They are scammed into coming here.  Else they are participating in the slave trade voluntarily, I suppose.  I don't see that anybody would choose this.  My supervisor wrote a slavery manifesto.  I guess that was enough to get him and his wife full time positions in Canberra.  Have I done enough for a PhD from the ANU yet??  HOw many years of labor is it supposed to take?  When is my thesis submission date?  When are you going to get it to externals?  Thanks for not helping me at all.  Thanks for not having supervision meetings.  Gee thanks.  I see why they pay you.  All the teaching work you have to do.  You must be so busy.  Sorry I only house sat for you once.  You forgot to leave any cat food by the way so I paid for that out of pocket.  Just trying to be helplful. You are welcome.
