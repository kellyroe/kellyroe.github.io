                             <p>Pretty funny haha that the Massey Academics want to say that if they lose their jobs their graduate students will suffer.  Why would their graduate students suffer?  The graduate students are supposed to be working independently.  Tell you what, if the people payrolled to supervise aren't being helpful, aren't getting the students work out to external examiners in a timely fashion etc etc...  Then maybe it really is time for the people on payroll to supervise...  To be let go.  They don't seem willing or able to do the job for which they are paid.  If they aren't going to be helpful then get out the f*cking way.  Hey.  </p>

                             <p>The thing about them treating international students as cash cows...  It's not just about international students.  It's about domestic students, too.  The farming of people.  That was Stuart McCutcheon's ideology.  Wasn't it?  That was why he was appointed to position as head of NZ's supposedly premier University.  Because he had attributed to him a doctoral thesis about how the farmers cry cry cry cry cry for more and more and more government handouts every winter they won't feed the lambs they'll die in the winter cold every year without more and more and more money.  The unbridled greed.  The business model.  Very...  Silence of the Lambs.  Wouldn't you say?  Where is the research output?  Where is all the independent graduate student research?  The 1 year theses?  The 2 year doctoral theses...  When are the public oral examinations scheduled?  So that interested members of the public can go along and see the oral examination of the doctoral candidates?  What university ffs?  There's nothing there.  What a f*cking face of a joke of a f*cking hoax of a f*cking scummy scam.  What 'University'?  There's nothing there.</p>

                             <p>We are seriously supposed to think that the anti-intellectual governments of NZL...  The...  Relatively most un-educated government in the western world...  Our un-intellectual government...  We are supposed to think that Jacinda Arden is a shining model of intellectualism, now?  Because she got given an honorary degree for reading teleprompts?  She gets 3 fellowships from Harvard for a book she's going to write (and not a book she's already written) when she never even applied for fellowships from Harvard and she never did a 4th year at University...  It just defies credibility, hey.  What a f*cking farce of a joke of a hoax of a f*cking scummy scam.</p>

                             <p>Basically...  People won't share.  Only over our dead bodies.  Well, then.  The choices that they've made.  Something about doing unto others as you'd have them do unto you.  Well then.  You see how they've chosen for themselves to be treated.  Let them gnaw each others arms off.    F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                             <p>I have a great idea for maximising the amount of unhappiness in the world.  Want to hear it?  Of course you do.  What could be a more admirable goal?  It goes like this...  You tell everybody that there is one and only one goal or point or purpose or aim in life.  Everybody is just fighting over one thing.  The same thing.  Everybody wants the same thing.  But not everybody can have the thing.  In fact nobody can have it.  There isn't anything there in fact.  It was just an elaborate ideology created to maximise the amount of suffering and pain and sickness and disease...  Just busy trying to be God.  All of the power and none of the responsibility.  Wasn't me.  Contracted out to the singularity.  The computer programme was the only thing that gave me the outputs or answers that I would accept.  I went with the one that gave me only the outputs or answers I would accept.  That was clearly the best one.  But when it comes time for responsibility for the one I picked, well, then, wasn't me.  Must have  been the singularity that did it.
                            </p>

                            <p>How much money did the NZ governmetn spend over how many years on...  Shortland Street?  Seriously..  How much money went into creating a television show to be exported around the world..  A marketing campaign.  An educational promotion...  To accompany 'wah wah wah we don't have any doctors.  Aw..  Pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for a visa to come to NZ because we don't have any doctors'.  How much money did NZ choose to invest in Shortland Street?  I suppose they would have done it because they didn't have a better idea of how to make money.  THey thought they would make money off of foreigners paying and paying and paying to come here and become doctors or nurses or whatever...  I suppose.  We thought that it would be a good use of arts funding.  To create a medical show about a...  About the Aucklaknd City Hospital?  About Middlemore?  About a private hospital?  Was it?  About who wants to be a doctor and the role they have and the power and so on...  Who wants to be a healthcare administrator...  About playing doctors and nurses...  And so on...  A creative output of NZL.</p>

                            <p>Was it?  It wasn't really...  Was it.  It was...  Purchased.  Wasn't it.  By some production company or whatever.  The idea of it.  Of NZL having that as a creative output.  It being about a private no public hospital and what it would do to lure people to the state of NZL.  It was an Australian...  Was it..  Grundy production?  OR similar.  They didn't want to do 'Home and Away' (about how everybody wants to be in state care in Australia uplifted from unhappy unhealty homes and raised in a trailor park)...  They specifically wanted to do a show about a hospital in NZL.</p>

                            <p>Why?  Well..  Dr Leeks don't grow on trees...  It takes a community to raise a child like that.  To grow up to do all the things he's revered for.  Everything it was that was valued.  He was worth moving to Melbourne and I don't know how much he was payrolled so that he could continue on with his crimes against the people of Melbourne.  It wasn't that they didn't know.  They picked him out because they did know.  They valued him as they knew him to be.  How...  Motivating.  And...  Inspiring.  Apparently.  Or similar.  Pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for a visa to move to NZL, everybody.  If you feel suitably motivated and inspired to become a Doctor.</p>

                            <p>Everybody else..  Well.  Nobody else applied.  Turns out.  Nobody else was able to get an application in!  Everybody else had their application thrown away!  He was the only game in town.  The only one of any value.  All heil Dr Leeks!  They should build a statue to his honor.  Only, they don't need to.  I mean, it's not like what he was doing was any different from what most everyone else on payroll was and is doing.  Right, Sterelny?  What's that you say?  We've been taken over  by over taken by psychoapths.  Yes.  Well, I guess you would know.   You being the only game in town, and all.  The only one they'd payroll.  To take all the philosophy curriculum out of the philosophy department so you can teach?  Do you?  Do you teach?  Or just take all of the research funding...  So you can reattribute authorship and control the narrative.  Oh, please, explain it to me.  How does it go?  The psychopaths have taken over.  We aren't any different from the f*cking apes.  Why shouldn't I just kill you right now?  Oh, because  you are young and cute with wide blinking eyes.  Unless you aren't.  In which case f*ck off and die then.  F*cking psychopaths.  What philosophy programme?  When do your students have their scheduled oral defences?  Did any of your studnets?  Did you have one?  Did you write your thesis or did Frank write it for you?  Is that why you don't want to talk about your supposed earlier works?  Because you never would have been given all the research funding if you actually wrote your own work.  Or something.  If you were actually working independently.  What education and training system?  There's nothing there ffs.  Nobody home.</p>
