 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">

                            <p>Review...</p>

                            <p>

                            <a  href=" https://nomadgoods.com/products/laptop-sleeve-horween-leather-rustic-brown-macbookpro-16-inch ">Nomad 13" sleeve.</a>  Many of the reviewers don't seem to be clear on what they are getting.  It is a synthetic hard-shell case.  Which is good because it offers hard-shell protection.  It is moulded into a 13" laptop size and it encases it solidy with firmly closing magnets to keep it enclosed.  The moulding is shaped to allow for your thumb to get in there to pry the magnets open so you can open up the hard-shell and remove the computer.  No danger of falling out accidentially.  THe hardshell a and magnets keep it securely closed once it is in there.  The hardshell has a moulded side portion to reveal the side ports.  That means that you can charge it when it is inside the case. I would imagine that liabity issues mean that Apple isn't willing to say that people could / should / may charge their Macbook while it is in a case.  Apple is also not willing to call these things 'laptops' anymore -- in case you sue them for infertility or cancers of the genital or abdominal region from sitting the devices on your lap or the vicinity of your lap.  Best just to avoid that kind of thing...  Anyway...  The hardshell case seems to be really well made.  But the leather aspect of component of it is a relatively thin skin.  Seems to me to be.  People focus on the patina.  I guess that is from the leather absorbing oils from your skin etc over time.  So that it wears darker in color..  But the thing that is notable about this leather is how easy it scratches.  I mean to say, I have had various leather goods before and never had a problem or issue or finding of anything leather having notable scratch marks on it.  This leather shows very obviously very visibl scratch marks on it, however.  You would think they might be buffed out of the leather by applying some kind of polish that would darken it.  But that doesn't seem to do it.  I'm not sure why this leather in particular scratches so easily.  Does the black leather scratch as well, or is it something about the brown color?</p>

                            <p>Don't get me wrong...  Am I happy about the case?  Yes.  I am  happy about the case.  I think it will protect the computer and it likely is safe to charge  it in there (though I'm sure Apple wouldn't recommend it and there may be issues with Apple selling something from the store that seems to endorce charging computers inside sleeves)...  But the thing is that this is not a thick leather.  It is a delicate leather that scratches easily.  It is a thin leather (I'm not sure how thick it is) that has been applied as a skin on an EVA case.  It has been really nicely done -- don't get me wrong.  And it is important to appreciate the hardwearing and durable and so on nature of synthetic fabrics.  But I do think that they should be clearer about the delicate nature of the leather they are using in fact.  It scratches easily.  The scratches are not easily buffed out.  It might well be the case (in fact, I think it likely) that over time it will become so scratched up that the scratches will merge into an overall look.  Sure.  But that is not the look they are advertising or marketing when tehy show scratch free products at day one and also day one hundred.  I think there is a bit of false advertising and selection of reviews that they aren't saying about how easily it scratches and they aren't showing how the scratches look at day 100 of actual use of the product. </p>

                            <p>Will I buy it again? No.  I shouldn't need to.  So long as companies keep making 13" portable computers (my preferred size) they should be able to fit in the sleeve and I won't need to buy another sleeve.  Would I  buy it again knowing what I know now?  Yes, I think I likely would.  But...  I wish they were more honest about the scratches and about it being a thin veneer of leather on an EVA case (for better or worse -- pros and cons with this).  I don't think that I've seen a really durable and rugged leather case so to the best of my knowledge you can't purchase one.  Or you'd have to source one from a craftsman.  I don't know who is making them...  But I think to be clear about what it is that these are.  And that they are being relatively mass produced so they are not the craftsman items they seem to want to pass them off as being at times.</p>

                            <p>It shipped really quickly.  Except that they say they couldn't deliver it the day they were supposed to because apparently I moved house.  SO I needed to contact / touch base with FedEx before they would deliver it at all.  NZ Post does that too. THey say 'we tried to deliver it but nobody was there to sign for it' and you say 'you did not try I was at home waiting for your delivery'.  The truth being they won't even attempt deliver (just lie that they did) until you yakkity yak yak yak to them on the phone.  SOmething to bear in mind if you are deaf or whatever and don't want to have a yakkity yak yak to get your package delivered.</p>

                            

                            <p>_____</p>

                           <p>Australasian Universities aren't functioning as Universities.  They aren't properly processing applications to enrol.  They aren't properly acknowledging progression through training.  They aren't employing people to supervise studnets, get their work out to external examiners, allow externals to sign the students off when their work is at the requisite standard.  They aren't graduating the studnets.  Keeping them re re re re re enrolled for more and more and more and more money for the University.  I've put some of my academic work up on this site.  I didn't start out overly or overtly political but they wouldn't process or progree my work.  I was supposed to just keep handing over more and more and more work, oh, and taking out more and more and more debt to the University so that they could have pay increases for themselves while they don't do the job for which they are paid.  I think the journals etc are just scams, basically.  Indefinately hold up publication until the people are bullied into leaving so they can reattribute authorship to people on payroll.  I don't know that the people they chose to say graduates had their theses externally examined or if they paid bribes or whatever to the University in exhange for them saying they'd done enough for their qualification completion.</p>

                           <p>Australasia doesn't really seem to have functioning or functional health system, education system, judiciary.  They didn't enrol, acknowledge progression through training, graduate, employ people willing and or able to do those kinds of jobs.  There doesn't really seem to be anything there.</p>

                           <p>The Australian Constitution says that NZ is a State of Australia.  It is named a State of Australia.  The second original state after NSW.  But Australia won't give Australian passports or birth certificates to people who were born in NZ.  Won't process applications for enrolment in certain qualifications. Won't supply federal voting papers.  Won't process applications for certain government jobs.  Who arranges for New Zealand Currency to be printed in...  Canada?  To disguise just how low NZ wages are kept.  To prevent travel and the like.  New Manus Island.  Prison camp.  Detention camp.  Keeping slaves.  Treating the students as their property.  More and more and more and more money for more and more and more enrolment.  Not doing the job for which they are paid.  I guess the reason why they pay CHris Whelan hundreds of thousands of dollars per year is because he has the statutory function of processing complaints of wrongdoing.  He has used his position to refuse to process any complaints of wrongdoing.  Una Jagose has used her position to obstruct justice and order evidence to be hidden and thrown away (her role in the abuse in NZ government care inquiry).  Reappointing retired judges back on payroll so they can see nothing wrong (Justice Toogood was recently appointed not by proper process).  Not even trying to do any of the things they are on payroll to do.  Seemingly on payroll precisely only because they are unwilling and or unable to do any of the things they are supposedly paid to do.  Upside down stupid-f*cking land.</p>

                           <p>
                               ______________
                           </p>

                           <p>I did my undergrad in Philosophy and Psychology and my Full-Time GPA (according to Univesrity of Auckland published algorithm) over my 4 year undergrad + honors years is 8.6 (out of a possible 9.0),  That is to say, somewhere between an A and an A+.  I wanted to apply to study for PhD in the USA because I wanted to do 2 more years of course-work and have a broader breadth and depth to my knowledge before writing a 3 year thesis.  I was told that I should enrol in a Masters Degree, then, and write a research thesis while I was applying to the US.  So I enrolled in a 120 point only Masters Research Qualification (Research Masters are only 120 points or 1 year or 1EFT qualifications for students who have already completed their Honors Year).  I got a summer research scholarship to the ANU and worked with Professor Martin Davies over the summer on his Australian Research Council funded project on 'delusion'.  That was how I started working on that topic.  He told me not to apply to Australia for PhD and the US for PhD at the same time because if I accepted offer of place to Australia and then the US said they wanted me then I would need to reneg on the Australian place which would mean they would be out of funding for a student since it would be too late for them to then give the place they offered to me to someone else.  So I held off applying to Australia (on Martin Davies Advice) and he did not supply a reference to me at the end of the SUmmer.  He said 'ask the people back home who will rave about you'.  I didn't get accepted to the 2 US Universities I applied to.  Cornell and MIT.  Cornell didn't let me know that my application had been declined.  I contacted them more than 3 months later and got a letter from one of their former employees who had moved to Harvard (the person I named as potential supervisor) to reassure me that my application had been forwarded to the department and processed.  They didn't just take my $80 US application fee and then not even process my application to Cornell at all!  She reassured me.  It was just that they didn't send me a letter to let me know that I hadn't been offered a place.  That was their only ommission. </p>

                           <p>The University of Waikato people encouraged me to apply for an extension to my Masters thesis work.  I think that was how it went.  Retrospectively.  They said that I could do more teaching for them if I was still enrolled as a student with them.  I could still have my University library access and access to office space.  Still live in University accommodation.  I don't quite remember how that went.  I do remember that nobody from Waikato suggested to me that I apply to do a PhD at Waikato since I'd already been working on a Masters Research for one year.   Nobody said 'just get out the work that you have and maybe the external examiners will suggest that you keep working on it as a doctoral thesis...  Or maybe they will say that you have done enough for a Masters thesis in one year...  Take a gap year..  Apply for jobs in something other than Philsoohpy..  If you want to do Medicine then apply to Auckland now, on the back of your current GPA...'  Nobody said anything like that.  All the people on University payroll for student support services and the like..  My supervisor..  Various people in the Philsophy Department...  They just encouraged me to take our re-enrolment in the 1 year Masters qualification.  Taking 2 years to do 120 points of work means I'm dropping back to part-time status.   How much teaching work was I doing at that time?  I think I was doing a lot, actually...  They will fill up the grad studnets with tutoring and grading and teaching...</p>

                           <p>I'm thinking of everyone I know who has done a Masters thesis.  With Waikato and Auckland. One person...  She said she ended up taking 2 years.  SHe will get very red in the cheeks and say that it was her fault for slacking...  She started out on one thing and then it turned into something else..  There was some special reason why she needed to take 2x the standard time.  Another person I know said that there was a special reason why he had to take 2x the standard time.  His supevisor was sick and so that's why he wasn't getting him the supervision and so on.  Everybody I know..  All of them.  Every single person has a story about why they were held back from being allowed to complete..  From being expected to complete.  Held back from completing their 1 year of research on time.  Every one of the studnets thinks that it is their fault.  Or their decision.  They take responsibility for why the University didn't look at graduating them for 1 year of research that htey did over 1 year.  They all think that they were lucky to have been allowed to graduate at all.  After being requird to take 2x the standard time.</p>

                           <p>After I didn't get a place in the US I applied to 2 Universities in Australia.  ANU and Macquarie.  ANU told me that Martin Davies was leaving for Oxford but I should make my project sort of broadly applicable to differnet people who might be around to supervise over that time.  Martin Davies refused to write me a reference but he said he would put in a good word for me at or with the ANU.  They offered me a scholarship funded place to study there.  Macquarie did as well.  And Paul Griffiths encouraged me to apply to Queensland.  I said I'd missed the application deadline and he said it didn't matter I should get an application in anyway.  Then I got offered a place at Queensland, too.  Even though I wasn't eligible for that since my application was received late.  They wanted me to write to Queensland and say, then, that I wasn't accepting the place in Queensland because of some political thing..  Paul Griffiths (after having encouraged me to apply to Queensland) turned out to be moving to Sydney anyway.  He didnt' tell me that.  He just encouraged me to apply to Queensland so I could study with him and then it turned out that he wasn't going to be in Queensland, anyway, so if I had have accepted a place in Queensland to study with him I would have ended up in Queensland while he moved to Sydney.  I mean to say.. It looks to me like they move the supervisors around.  WHen it's time to sign their student off or do work supervising their students.  They move them so the studnets can internalise why they need to take more and more and more time.  WHy their work isn't being accepted by the Univesrity.</p>

                           <p>My ANU notes say that Kim Sterelny was named as my supervisor.  He didn't arrive until I'd been there for 6 months.  He didn't email me or anything before he arrived.  I have writing that I did (I've posted it on the seminars page) so you can see the sort of 6,000 word articles that I was writing during my first 2 years at the ANU.  Then I went to North Carolina Chapel Hill for 1 year.  You can see the work I wrote for the Centre For Cognitive Neuroscience when I was auditing one of their graduate level classes (for no credit).  Responding to the course contents for the textbook that the faculty on staff wrote there.  Giving them my written work for course content that I'll not be formally credited with.  I didn't give course work to UNC Chapel Hill. I wasn't sure how that was supposed to go.  Auditing courses for no credit.  Am I to give them written work so they can reattribute authorship to someone else for someoen else to have credit for my work, then?  Is that the idea/l?  I was paid by UNC Chapel Hill to teach 1 course per semester, though (the equivalent of their grad students) and I could attend their courses.  So I could listen to 1 year of leactures and participate in tutorial discussions etc in graduate level courses that are not offered, at all, in Australasia.  With the 3 years (or however many decades)of research only doctoral theses.  THey don't have graduate level coursework.  </p>

                           <p>Then I return to Australia and they don't give me any comments on my written work.  I don't want ot go up to University to have morning tea and afternoon tea and eat my lunch.  So I stop going to University.  I email them my work so there is a record they received it.  There weren't in person meetings.  Check my supervisors email outbox for evidence of supervision.  I don't see any evidence that he did the job for which he was on payroll.  But that was his job -- right?  To get more and more and more money for hte 'university' for keeping hostages re re r er e re re re re re re re enrolled. His slaves a slaving . So he can take their work and reattribute authorship to someone else.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                           <p>So, that's a  nasty business.  I wanted to do Medicine.  Work as a Psychiatrist.  There wasn't anything there in Philosophy, you see.  Psychopaths...  Been taken over by people having soooo much fun taking all the money...  Requiring studnets go on camping trips...  Dinners.  Drinks.  Not processing the work.  Not getting the work to externals.</p>

                           <p>Australia won't allow NZ citizens to take Australian Government Loans to train in certain courses (e.g., Medicine).  NZ studnets are considered local only for some things.  I was given a local scholarship for PhD study.  But wasn't eligible for HELP or HEX (they renamed it aptly, apparently, anyway).  THey are keeping slave prison hostage detention camps.  They don't have a health system.  It's sooooo competitive.  Death camps.  I mean...  Dr Leeks.  Once it started to become publically known the kinds and sorts of things he'd been doing they moved him to Melbourne.  To better facilitate his ongoing crimes.  They intentionally enabled him.  He was most valued employee.  That tells you everything you need to know about Psychiatry.  Medicine generally.  I mean, it's not plausible to think they don't have security cameras up in the OR's etc.  The ED's etc.  But still all these unauthorised people in the OR's and the ED's committing various crimes.  Atrocities.  On government payroll to commite crimes and atrocities.  </p>

                           <p>The wrong people won the war in Australasia.  We know because the atrocities never stopped.  Not even trying to be fair.  It's soooooo competitive, apparently.  There's nothing here.  Psychopaths.</p>

                           <p>They want to say more than 80 per cent of NZ studnets enrolled in 'Degree qualifications' are doing 'vocational degrees'.  What that means is that they do internship after internship after internship after internship while the Government records only increasing levels of debt against their name because they supposedly or allegedly owe the universities for course-fees.  The Universities get money from the government more and more and more and more money for having slaves a slaving on their internships.  It has no inention at all of graduating any of them at all. It is not going to pay any of them at all for doing skilled labor post-graduation.  You can get paid minimum wage to be a 'healthcare assistant' in an 'unskilled capacity' else you can pay and pay and pay and pay the university to do the same job as an unpaid intern with the vauge promise that after however many years of you a slaving they'll graduate you and employ you as a registered nurse. But why would they pay you to work as a registered nurse when they can get you paying the university and slaving the job for free?  Look at all the research work that I handed over to the Univerisity.  MOre and more and more and more research while they record only ever increasing levels of debt against my name.  Look at the research output of all the people on payroll?  Plagarists.  They don't write research output.  They are too busy having morning tea and lunch and afternoon tea and dinner and drinks and going off on camping trips.  Flying around the world to have yakkity yak yaks about reattributing the research output of the slaves to people on payroll who don't even to any of the ethings for which they are paid.  What research output?  What Universities?  What health system? What Judiciary?  There's nothing there.</p>

                           <p>Looking at hte Jobs available in NZ anyone would think the most in-demand job there is is the job that the government advertises and readvertises and readvertises.  For someone to work for the government as a 'recruitment consultant' and record how many hostages they are keeping unemployed or redeployed to voluntary work or slave work.  When it's time to pay the workers it's time to have them deported.  Right?  Locked up in the name of psychiatry (they must be mentally ill if they think they are going to get sign off on completion of training).  There's nothing here.  Garbage dump of a f*cking wasteland.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                           <p>I think Queensland has stopped doing genetic testing because most people's paternity turns out to be problematic.  The increasing number of people turning to 'medical professionals' to help them conceive.  Why would anybody think that they would actually be making viable embryos that are actually the progeny of the people who think they are...  I mean to say...  Wouldn't it be more likely that some f*cking psychopath Medical Doctor (the only one they would have on payroll) was using his own sperm for everything?  Wouldn't that be more likely?  Jacinda announces to the Medical Graduates of Harvard that NZ never prosecuted anybody for wrongful death of a foetus.  We have highest rates of abuse and so on.  What they really want to do is breed knock-out babies..  Try knocking out various genes. In the name of medical research and helping people of course.  But what they are looking for is trying to breed 'angel-man' babies.  Pretty little elven things who you can do anything anything anything to and they will just giggle and smile.  I would imagine they would / could get quite a lot of money for infants like that.  Non-verbal would be best.  Not able to testify against the government or anybody else in a court of law.  Maybe not having the congnitive capacity to understand anything that's going on.  We don't know how lucky we are to be gamma babies.  I would imagine that there would be quite the market for blow-up doll people.  You can do anything anything anything anything to them and they will never communicate about your crimes.  We can keep them in government institutions or sell them in the private market.  NZ is the best place in the world to come and do things like that.  Right, Jacinda?  Nobody was ever prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus.  Nobody was prosecuted for sexually molesting patients when they had been anesthetised for unrelated procedures (they go on about unauthorised cervical exams but implanting embryos and removing embryos when they are viable outside the womb as Fisher and Paykal incubator babies, maybe let's try and see)...  NZ is the best place in teh world to come and live out all of those fantasies (I think the Diablo people would put it like that).  So we can understand the nature of the competition.  The lengths that some people will go to to ensure that the likes of Dr Leeks and Professor Glue are the only game in town.  Why they reappoint judges not via proper process at all (e.g., Justice Toogood was not appointed by proper process).  Una Jagose publically admitted to her role in refusing to prosecute wrongdoing.  Throwing evidence away.  ordering obstruction of justice throwing away evidence.  Corruption.  There are none so blind as those who will not see.  </p>

                           <p>Presumably there isn't anything wrong with the reading comprehension of the leaders of the US and so on.  But who knows.  COrnell doesn't seem capable of processing applications to enrol.  Why do they acknowledge NZ as a country when they can read the Australian constitution?  Where is Jacinda anyway.  Who voluntarily chooses to walk away from her pay cheque?  She can't be employed to teach at Harvard on the back of a 3 year con-munications degree from Waikato, surely.  But then Ashley Bloomfield was re-deployed to University of Auckland Professor when he never applied to PhD, never wrote a doctoral thesis, never was examined for one.  Doesn't have a research output.  He's a medical doctor -- right?  A medical graduate who was acknowledged as graduated.  But they will not register him to see patients and he sees no patients.  That sounds right.  They will never pay him to work the job for which he trained.  They will re-deploy him only to ensure that he takes up a place or position ensuring that nobody works that job, either.  There's nothing here.</p>

                           <p>kim.com should have been extradited to stand trial in the US under Australian Law.  The courts refused to extradite him.  He pays the NZ courts, he pays the NZ courts, he pays the NZ courts.  THey order re re re re re re filing and more and more money to be paid to the NZ courts.  They say NZ doesn't have the laws to extradite him.  Australia does.  But the Federal courts of Australia refuse to acknoweldge or process filings from NZ . They say they don't have jurisdiction because the only people they would put on payroll are too f*cking stupid to parse the Australian Constitution, one can only suppose.  </p>
