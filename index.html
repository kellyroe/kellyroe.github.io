                             <p>I am not entirely sure what to do about revisions.  On the one hand it is tempting for me to do them.  On the other hand, nobody is paying me to do them.</p>

                             Not sure what date to put on that.  2010?  2011?  2012?  The Australian National University has inserted the table of content into my student record notes as evidence they were supplied with the document that is of sufficient length for doctoral examination during a time in which I was enrolled as a doctoral candidate.  Maybe ask them when they intend to schedule the public oral defence?  Get them to pass the external examiners comments along to me so I can prepare for the oral defense?  Looking forward to it!  When do you think it might be?  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                               Does anybody enrolled in the ANU get reports from external examiners and hold a public defence?  Ever?  Any of them?  Any of them at all?  Any of them who are presently employed either at the ANU, or elsewhere in Australia?  Any of them who got paid employment overseas and visas, apparently dependent on their status as doctoral graduates?  (1)  How many years after their enrolment start date were they kept enrolled before their work went out for external exam?  (2)  How many years later did they get reports from examiners (did they get any)?  (3)  Where and when was their public oral defence scheduled?  (4)  Any atendees for that?  Is it a university -- or a prison, slave, or detention camp?  What Universities?
                         </p>

                                <p><a href="./publish/2013-rep.pdf">Roe, (2013).  A few small chunks for 2013.</a>
                                </p>

                                <p>Sterelny referred to the above as a `few small chunks' so I'm taking him to be authorative on that.  Maybe he was only focussed on the parts that referenced himself.</p>

                                 <p><a href="./publish/2018-rep-1.pdf">Roe, (2018).  Disability and equity for medicine and public health (September, 2018)</a>
                                </p>

                                <p>This was a 120 point 1 EFT 34 week (including the external examination process MPhil).  3 spiral bound copies were supplied to the Research School on 14 September 2018 and they still haven't send it out for external examination.</p>

                                  <p><a href="./publish/2018-rep-2.pdf">Roe, (2018).  Disability and equity for medicine and public health (October, 2018)</a>
                                </p>

                                <p>The University sent the MPhil out requesting `doctoral reports' from externals.  I don't know if externals were paid the amount associated with Masters or Doctoral examination but they were supplied with templates for doctoral examination only.</p>

                                <p><a href="./publish/2019-rep-1.pdf">Roe, (2019).  Disability and equity for medicine and public health (February, 2019)</a>
                                </p>

                                <p>This was the thesis I substantively updated in response to the `doctoral reports' of external examiners of my MPhil.  While they provided enough comments to turn the under 50,000 word 1 EFT MPhil into a 360 point 100,000 word PhD - that wasn't the programme that I applied to be enrolled in.  I even wrote a commentary for the examiners (the Dean said it would make it more likely to be accepted) - and the Dean refused to get the thesis and refused to get the comments to externals. </p>

                                <p>University of Auckland said that I wasn't eligible to start MBChB with Auckland in 2019 because I hadn't completed a qualification from a NZ University within the last 5 years.  That is not what the Education and Training Act says.  The law says I'm eligible because I'm a domestic adult who has attained the age of 20 years.  The above link was a 120 point 1 EFT MPhil completed in the 34 weeks that the TEC says is the normal amount of time to be associated with that qualification.  NZ is not even trying to keep Universities.  We see the lengths they go to to refuse to enrol eligible candidates into their Medical School.  Sorry, their prison slave detention camp.  Where Medical studnets go to die.  Nobody actually graduates from that programme of study.  Right?  Where do the medical graduates go?  They go off in Australian submarines never to be heard from again?  Where are all the doctors?  What Universities?  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p><a href="./publish/2018-rep-2.pdf">Roe, (2019).  Disability and equity for medicine and public health (June, 2019)</a>
                                </p>

                                <p>I get a letter that is pretty obviously extortion.  Saying I am to be kept re-enrolled for 20 points (that more money will be invoiced to my student loan for re-enrolment) and then I am to be detained indefinately under the zero fee scheme (which is for first year studnets and not graduates).  You can follow the legal action over on the tab for that.  NZ is not even trying to be rule by law.  Justice Toogood was reappointend from retirement.  He is past the compulsory age of retirement for judges.  That means to say that after 45 +++ years of government payroll he's still not financially independent from all the government handouts.  We don't have any new judges to appoint, one can only suppose, because nobody graduates from law school.  What Universities?  There is nothing there.</p>

                                <p>The judges refuse to process the cases that were filed.  The change the issue from the one that was filed into something to delay delay delay confuse obstruct prohibit prevent deny.  They refuse to accept evidence presented to them.  THey make false assertions in their judgements.  They ignore half the laws.  There is nothing there.  Not a developed country, at all.  I really don't see that Australia is even trying to be any different.</p>

                                <p>I wrote to the ANU and they said they would not do anything unless I lodged a formal complaint via formal process.  I said I would prefer to sort things out informally and they declined.  I said I wanted to lodge a formal complaint, then.  They then refuse to acknowledge that anything I supply to them is in fact a formal complaint.  There is nothing there.  They don't have a University.  There is nothing there.</p>

                                <p>The manufacture of disease.  Animal cells don't really grow in dishes.  So they try and cause cancers with radiation and so on, trying to get the cells to grow so they can grow them in dishes.  But they don't grow very well in dishes.  So you get samples from cells and tumors etc etc and do your best to get them to grow in dishes.  Then you implant them into whoever you can find and see what you get growing.  Like the tobacco mosaic virus.  Collect it from a plant, grow it in the lab, then put it into another plant and see the new plant get the same sickness.  The manufacture of sickness.  How many people can we kill today?  It's soooooo hostile and it's sooooo competitive!  Nobody need apply!  It's soooo hostile and it's soooo competitive they get thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of medical student every year it's so competitive!  Oh my!  And they die before they'll be graduated.  I'm sure.  So the daughter of the Vice Chancellor can get busy busy busy seeing how many aboriginals she can kill today.  Or similar.  What a f*cking farce of a hoax of a joke of a f*cking scummy scam.  Where is my PhD ffs?  F*cking psychopaths.</p>
