                                <p>This website documents how Australasia does not have an Education and Training System.  Rather, they keep a series or system of detention or prison or slave camps up and down the land.  It is sooooo competitive that some people are paid by the government to hold hostages or to keep slaves while other people are to be kept detained indefinately with no credit for the work they have done while their work is not sent out to external examiners else it is sent out for examination for the wrong degree.  Apparently I need to wait for the older generation to die  before there will be a job for me.  Once they have received all the research and teaching money they believe they are entitled to then there is nothing left for me, you see.
