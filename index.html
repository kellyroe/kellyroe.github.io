                             <p>I am file re-formatting my work and organising it into yearly increments.  E.g., </p>

                             <p>
                              <a href="./writing/ks.png">Here is an example of an email from Kim Sterelny (who will not write me a reference) so you can see how he chooses to speak to me.</a> 

                              I collated the 'few small chunks' as he refers to them, here:
                              </p> 

                                <p><a href="./publish/2013-rep.pdf">Roe, (2013).  A few small chunks for 2013.</a>
                                </p>

                                <p>Did you win, Sterelny?  Did you manage to starve the humanity out of me?  I'm just begging to house-sit for you and go away on camping trips.  It's sooooo important to my career to do anything anything anything.  Did Carl graduate, yet?  For how many decades did you get him house-sitting for you?</p>

                                <p>I guess the idea is that you pay peanuts and you get monkeys.  That way Sterelny can be the only game in town. </p>

                                <p>How  many years did Dave Wall give Daniel Stoljar doctoral work -- before he was hospitalised, given dextrose or glucose before thiamine -- which put him into a coma so he nearly died?  How many years was he handing over doctoral work before things deteriorated to that point?</p>

                                <p>The whole time I was at the ANU I didn't see anybody with reports from external examiners.  Nobody had their work go out for external examination -- did they?  I didn't see anybody (from any department)  have a scheduled oral examination or defence.  No public defenses.  I don't remember seeing anybody in a doctoral gown for graduation, either.  Did people actually get conferred qualifications?  How?  How are some people getting paid employment for post-doctoral fellowship positions?  People other than Jacinda Ardern, I mean.  For the book she's going to write, one day.  Or the book she's going to have attributed to her, or something.  For her Honorary doctorate for all the research output she's done already.  Of course.  Enough for 3 fellowships from Harvard!</p>

                                <p>What education and training system?  There's nothing there.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  What a f*cking hoax of a scummy scam.  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>Waikato won't send work out to externals, either, else if they do they won't listen to what externals have to say.  That's if they can even arrange for it to be examined for the degree I was actually enrolled in (which, turns out, they can't).  My external requested an oral defense (after they asked him to write reports of it for the wrong qualification) then he seems to have forgotten what year it is requesting an oral defense to be held in his report of 2012.  What education and training system?  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p> <a href="./writing/OSex2019.pdf">Overseas Examiner's report of 2019 (he seems to think it's 2012)</a>  Do you think he knows what's reasonable to expect of a 120 point MPhil qualification?  Quigley says the MPhil is not an EFTS qualification.  But the Tertiary Education Commission says that if the University wants to bill it to Student Loans then they need to report (1) points (2) EFTS and (3) enrolment dates.  They billed it to my Studnet loan therefore it is an EFTS based qualification.  I'm sure I don't need to explain this to the person who was the best applicant for VC of the University of Waikato.  I'm sure he knows that 120 points = 1 EFT = 34 weeks work (including the examination period) and I'm sure he has the application to enrol that was acknowledged as having been received by the University by the published deadline.  I have acknowledgement that they received it by the deadline and the Statutory Law (educaiton and training act) says that I am eligible.  But that's too hard for the most qualified applicant for the position of VC of Auckland (x 2) and it's also too hard for the judiciary!  Wow!!  Must  be something about our educaiton and trianing system and what being 'most qualified' for employment meeeeeans.  Or something.  That must be the problem.  Yeah.  Right.  </p>

                                <p>The Office of the Ombudsman</p>

                                <p>Peter Boshier is over 65 and it's time for him to retire, therefore.  It's time to appoint someone else to be head of that organisation.</p>

                                <p>I doubt the integrity of their hiring practices.  </p>

                                <p>I have applied for 7 positions, now.  Of all levels.  From principal to senior to a junior advisor or investigator position where they say that they will provide training.  I don't even make it to interview.  I find it hard to believe that they would need to hire from overseas because they don't have any people in NZ willing or able to do that job.  What job?  Inspections of the 'hospitals' and 'prisons' and 'schools' and the state care institutions of abuse up and down the land.  Writing the reports on how many people are being unlawfully involuntariliy detained and drugged and so on and so forth.  Unlawfully being detained in seclusion.  Being bullied and abused by the government.  By the only people they would payroll to play doctors and nurses and teachers and so on.  The only people they would payroll for those positions.  </p>

                                <p>NZ does not have a functioning administration or judiciary.  The Office of the Ombudsman is supposed to be an NGO but they don't seem willing or able to do their job, either.</p>

                                <p>It defies credibility or belief that my application for employment gets thrown out before interview.  There's really nothing in NZ.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                                <p>Make public the people you hired.  I guess they have PhD's. Do they?  Most qualified.  Hire the most qualified person for the position.  Must have 2 masters and a PhD and...  Oh my.  It's sooooo competitive!!  It's soooo competitive that Peter Boshier simply cannot retire!  Nor can Justice Toogood!  He doesn't see anything wrong with the untimly deaths of Mason Pendrous or Olivia Podmore.  Died in NZ state care institutions.  Both.  If Canterbury manages to kill 2 in the halls this year does that mean they'll double the hall application fee for the following?  What education and training system?  There's nothing there.  Expected to be marched off to the death camps so the over 65's will never have to give up their payroll.  Or maybe their kids actually killed them and they just get Daddy's payroll being diverted into their own personal bank accounts so they never have to work.  I suppose that's probably more likely.  </p>

                                <p>I mean that's what you have to do?  It's called 'standing up for yourself'.  When you string them up like pinyata and bash them until your share of the money falls out.  It's `fostering respectful relationships'.  Is that the general idea?</p>
