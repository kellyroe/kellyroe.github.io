                            <article>

                                <p>So apparently Dr Ashley Bloomfield (MBChB) is Professor of the Univesrity of Auckland, now.  He does not have a PhD, any tutoring grading or lecturing experience, academic publications.  Therefore must have.  He must have been the only applicant for the postion.  Nobody with a PhD applied.  Nobody with any tutoring grading or lecturing experiece applied.  Nobody with any academic publications.  They didn't get a single applicant with any experience of working in a Univesrity environment.  Nobody from New Zealand and nobody from overseas.  With all the layoffs that AUT is doing nobody with any university experience applied or was encouraged to apply to become Professor of the University of Auckland.  Ashley Bloomfield was the best candidate for the job.  There isn't any corruption in New Zealand.  No corruption, at all.  Now that the courts have ruled that the Government does't need students to actually apply to courses for the 'University' to record that they have been enrolled in courses (and bill their student loans accordingly).  Now Ashley Bloomfield can be an independent contractor to say that he is recieving all of the government research and teaching award money for all of the research and teaching work that he is so renowned for that he gets to be made Professor of New Zealanads premier University! 
                                </p>

                                <p>I would imagine it is quite the pay cut for him (from around half a million to around a quarter of a mmillion, was it?)  I suppose, then, that the deal will come with sweeteners.  A house?  What else?  How many teenager virgins for Ashley?  But it's soooooooooo competitive and New Zealand Universities are garbage garbage garbage for the bottom feeders with no other options garbage garbage garbage.  So say they all.  AUT is garbage.  Waikato is garbage.  Otago is garbage.  NZ is garbage so Auckland certainly is garbage.  Australia, also, is garbage.  Where the garbage goes that did not get to go to the USA.  And of course the USA is garbage, as well.  Unless you pay the University you pay the University you pay the Univesrity for however many studnets you get to call garbage garbgage garbage.  What an experience!  People who refuse to get your work to externals (presumably because it's garbage) so as to prevent and prohibit you from having credit for your work so that Ashley Bloomfield can be the only applicant. The only game in town.  Wah wah wah NZ doesn't have any Medical Doctors.  Right Ashley?  Wah wah wah.  NZ doesn't have any PhD graduates.  Aren't any in the whole world -- right Ashley?  Well then, that must qualify you for ALLLLLL the jobs.  Allllllll the jobs for the Rt Honorable Dr Ashley Bloomfield MBChB PhD MD BS.  Roll up roll up roll up to be signed up for the population health qualification in how people must take their shots one way or another...</p>

                                <p>I guess the idea is that by promoting NZ as being the bottom of the garbage land it means that it can be the destination for all the experimental research that wouldn't get through the ethics boards of overseas.   Because, you know how it is, we will fill the ethics boards with pedophiles, if need be, to ensure the experiments get to keep rolling along.  That sort of explains the cameras in the ethics and psychology seminars.  How the people on staff hang their heads.  They are trying to see who lacks moral emotions.  That seems to be the ideology of it.  People who don't see anything wrong with atrocities.  Must have for everything in NZ.  MOst desirable place to be a psychopath land.  Real destination for all the garbage.  By design.</p>

                                <p>Stanford is saying now about experiments that were done on black prisoners back whenever.  They had signed consent forms and paid them a token for participating as experimental subjects.  They say that people wanted to participate because they were kept poorly enough such that they would be willing to do anything anything anything for the money.  Right?  Anyway, they are saying that it wasn't okay.  But it was in accordance with the ethics or the norms or whatever at the time.  I mean to say they would only hire employees who had that view of it, of course.  NZ is trying to normalise child abuse and so on so that people don't feel that there is anything particularly bad or wrong sending the pedophiles and the like to NZ.  It isn't like the nations in Australasia aren't fill with moral degenerates, right?  They will fit right on in.  Right?  The only sorts of things we want to know or hear about are how degenerate the people in Australasia are endemically.  We only want to hear about the nasty abuses going on within native communities, mostly, especially, so that we can justify shipping the worst of the degenerates off to the colonies to go research on other people children etc.  Right Ashley?  Did they publically advertise your job, then?  Really?  How many applicants were there for your job?</p>

                                <p>So Ashley did a Masters in Public Health.  Was that a 1 year research only masters or a 2 year Masters with maybe 1 year of coursework and a 1 year research component?  How many weeks months years did they get you working on your research component?  2 years?  Before they took another year to examine it?  You mean to say they made you take a PhD length of time (3 years including the examination period) to do 1/2 the work of a PhD?  Did they tell you that was the pathway to becoming an academic?  Did you even write a thesis?  What was your thesis about?  I'm curious because of Stuart McCutcheons being about breeding more lambs than you can feed so you can cry cry cry to the government for more money every winter else the lamb hostages will starve.  Then you use that money you got from the government for fattening them up for the spring slaughter for increased profits for yourself.  Then cry cry cry for more money from the government because you bred more lambs than you would feed through the winter unless the government gave you more and more and more money to feed them through the winter...  Quite the business marketing managing model for the University of Auckland.  Really desirable place for the very very best and brightest of the NZ studnets.  Wouldn't you say?  Must have.  Must have all the best and the brightest studnets of NZ.  Wouldn't you say?  Cry cry cry cry cry for more money from the Government for keeping the lambs going off to the slaughter.  All the Professorships for Ashley!</p>

                                <p>I suppose the idea is that it doesn't matter.  Ashley doesn't need to have a PhD to refuse to supervise studnets in their PhD research.  You can't supervise students in doing a higher level qualificiation than one you have.  Apparently that's why we don't have MD or JD research in NZ.  There isn't anybody with those qualifications to supervise those Degrees.  They are in the University Calendar for a couple of the NZ Universities, but to the best of my knowledge they don't enrol anybody in, supervise, or graduate anybody from those qualifications.  They also don't seem to be enrolling, progressing, or signing off on PhD qualifications, either.  They won't get the students work out to externals.  They won't do it.  They won't help the student get PhD.  The people collecing up all the research money don't want to share.  They want to be the only game in town.  It's sooooooo competitive.  </p>

                                <p>Most if not all of the research projects seem intentionally designed to showcase that the students are lacking in morality and / or integrity and / or knowledge and ability etc etc.  They call them 'terminal degrees' or 'terminal qualifications' because then your right to life, or something, is declared to be given up.  See, your only value is the value that you have to the University that the University can cry for more and more and more and more money from the Government for recording your enrolment and reenrollment and reenrollment and reenrollment nd reenrollment nd reenrollment collecting up more and more and more money.  What is in it for the NZ government?  Every studnet hostage does not count for unemployment or disability stats.  You say they are in 'education and training' programmes.  THen you intentionally record higher and higher and higher levels of debt against their name while refusing to get their work to externals and paying internal people to bully and abuse them.  Worst case you record that you have successfully disabled or handicapped them.  Still don't count for unemployment.  How many FTE positions, in NZ, again?  To be filled by how many people?  How many FTE positions for Ashley?  How many years did he take to complete his 1 year of research research component on his Masters?  Oh, let me guess, Auckalnd lacks the capacity to keep accurate student enrolment records and lacks the capacity to keep transcripts.  What a f*cking joke.</p>

                                <p>You see all the 'must haves' passing themselves off as Medical Doctors, in NZ.  One can only suppose they are paying sums of money in exhange for committing atrocities against the people of NZ.  It is convenient for wrongful deathbringing pedophiles to pass themselves off as Medical Doctors and teachers and the like, for obvious reasons.  THe Universities of NZ are refusing to process applications properly.  What Universities?  What skilled workers?  NZ intentionally sells out the people in order to be, effectively, the prison camp detention land of all the psychopaths shipped here from overseas.  Why the hell did we need to pay someone from England to be Dean of the Research School of the Univesrity of Waikato?  What she does is falsely record student enrolments (by saying that studnets will never get their qualifications unless they reenroll and reenroll and reenroll and reenroll and pay more and more and more money to the University) so as to double bill and keep false enrolment records and then hoard the f*cking theses and not get them out for external examination.  HOw much money do they pay the f*cking psychopath?  Why are we paying a foreigner to undermine the entire f*cking university?  THey don't have the willingness and or ability to get out of the f*cking way of their research students.  It isn't a univesrity.  THey won't do it.  Can't / won't employ anybody willing and or able to supervise graduate student research?  Can't and won't even pay people to get out of the f*cking way so that some actual f*ckign research could be f*ckign done for a f*cking change.  What is the research output of the people paid to do research?  How f*cking slow can they possibly work?  Their first year students output more research than they do ffs.  It really isn't supposed to be that f*cking hard.</p>
