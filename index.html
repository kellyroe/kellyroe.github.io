                            <p>Ask the people on your payroll.</p>

                            <p>Note that the USA and China are not doing business in this judisdiction, anymore.  New Zealand is closed, for business.  Our politicians and business leaders are required to travel overseas to sign contracts in foreign jurisdictions.  Better start training up  your legal defense to be heard in foreign jurisdictions, then.  Since you will be accountable to them and their military, one can only suppose.  How are you going to find people acknowledged as lawyers by foreign courts who will choose to represent you?  But how can  you win, otherwise?  No more pulling judges out of retirement to claim to receive evidence that was never supplied and to refuse to accept evidence that was supplied.  But you'll never be extradited to stand trial, you think?  Turn this whole state of Australia into New Manus Island detention camp prison facility.  Do you think that China would do you the courtesy of translating your trial into English?  Why would they offer you translation services?  Why would they extend to you any courtesy that you refuse to extend to others?  Makes no f*cking sense, at all. </p>

                            <p> Don't worry, Ayesha is trying to motivate and inspire a  new lot of people to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the 'Universities' for the honor of getting to kill patients in the vague hope that if they start killing patients nobody will talk to them.  What do you have to do to get them to shut up their face-holes?  It is like the people responsible for all the delays in the abuse in state care inquiry are paid by the amount of time that they take, or something.  Alllllll the extensions for them, therefore.  The compulsory extensions for them.  More and more and more time to make things worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.  Why don't  you practice Medicine, Ayesha?  They gave you a training place and they say that you graduated.  Why don't you do your job, then?  When did Ashley Bloomfield last see a patient?  What happened last time he killed a patient, then?  It's soooooooooo competitive.  It's soooooooo competitive!!!  It's soooooo competitive not everybody gets to do it, nobody gets to do it, there's nothing there.  It's sooooooooooooo competitive!!!!!</p>

                            <p>I don't know how Amy and Sah do it!  They are supermen amongst people!  Able to work as an emergency room physician and able to work practically another full time job as a Les Mills Group Fitness Instructor Model leading high intensity training classes like Spin Cycling.  Able to be enrolled as a Medical Student while attending workplace internships while being able to work practically another full time job as a Les Mills Group Fitness Instructor Model leading group fitness classes.  I don't know how they do it!  Where they find these supermen!  Maybe want to give Amy a few more ER shifts if she's got that much energy to burn at the end of her ER day because that is not what other ER employees are saying about the reality of life as an ER physician.  She stealing the good stuff or...  What is the most likely explanation,  here?  </p>

                            <p>So...  All those people who enrol in Sport and Exercise Science qualifications...  They don't get to work as Group Fitness Instructor Models because that would consitute skilled labor, one can only suppose, and if there is one thing that we know about New Zealand it is that nobody will actually be paid to do skilled labor.  We will get the Chemistry PhD's and put them to work as marketers and...</p>

                            <p>What 'Education and Training System'?  It's soooooooo competitive there simply isn't anything there!</p>

                            <p>We really don't need to reinvent the wheel on 'best practice' and cry cry cry cry cry about  how it is alll toooooo haaaaaard.  Best practices have been developed already.  E.g., The surgical safety checklist that was origionally developed for aviation security regarding who is in the flight deck, their credentials, and the specific role they are playing in the operations today.  The check-list of what safety checks have been done.  Etc.  Our problem is that we REFUSE to follow best practice.  Consistently choosing people too stupid or pigheaded or both to do what it is that they are supposed to do.  Those who grubby grubbed their way into positions (just get in there and take it fake it until you have it and then it's yours and nobody will be able to get rid of you) say that there is no alternative to them.  No alterative to Dawkins f*cking seflish genes and the hostile competitive uncooperative prison camp detention facility that is the State of New Zealand.  So says the only one's you'd payroll.  What's that University of Auckland?  Better write another ethics paper on how targeting the children to be victims of the state is morally compulsory!  Only way to be made Professor in the garbage dump of a wasteland.  Best be writing papers for the NZ Medical Students Journal, then, Sah's a little busy reading the script for whatever relase of Balance...  Oh...  No, she's not.  She's making up her own flows now?  She's a natural!</p>
