			<h1>Kelly Alexandra Roe</h1>
		<p>I use my full name to make it less likely that I will be confused with other Kelly Roe's on the internet -- for better or worse.</p>
				
		<p>I set up this website in the context of learning how to get .html content and links to pdf files displaying for others over the internet.</p>

		<p>I am not really building or shipping software.</p>

		<p>As such, I have made a website over here:  kellyroe.org</p>

		<p>I am in the process of getting my doi numbers to resolve to there rather than here and updating links in my curriculum vitae etc.</p>
