                                <p>I am seeking advice about the appropriateness of editing previous work.  I am concerned that alterations to it now mean that it is not a fair representation of work that was done then.  On the other hand, if it can be made better, perhaps it should be.</p>

                                <p>How  many years work does a PhD (doctoral qualification) represent?</p>
