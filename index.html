 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container"> 

                            <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/490864/hackers-selling-access-to-school-it-systems-cyber-security-firm-says  Oh noes the hackers must have done it!  How much will Stuart McCutcheon 2.0  pay to say 'wasn't me -- must've been the hackers!!'.  
                            </p>

                            <p>Make a little 'submit' button 'application to graduate' with a script saying the applicant doesn't pass the bot test.  Oh noes!  Must have been the hackers!!!  Must be the Russians.  'There could be no application that could be received such that...'  We can't see anything wrong.  Did you see something wrong Chris Whelan?  Justice Toogood?  Una Jagose?  When does your voluntary retirement take effect, Una?  I thought you were standing down over the role you played in destruction of evidence and obstruction of justice etc etc in the investigation into abuse in state care.  </p>

                            <p>The hackkers must have destroyed all the consent forms.  Must have been the hackers.  The hackers must have destroyed all the prescriptions.  Made it impossible for anybody to obtain a medical registration number.  What medical registration?  Where is the list of individuals autorised to write medical prescriptions in NZ?  Oh noes!!  Must be the hackers!!  What health records?  What education records?  What judiciary?  Oh noes!!! Must have been the hackers!!!</p>

                            <p>LET ME TELL YOU A STORY</p>

                            <p>Our story begins with a hospital online records system that is configured such that a change in login requires a system restart and the person trying to login needs to wait...  However many minutes...  Before they are logged in and able to access patient notes, for example.  So...  Someone sneaks up behind you when you are logged in and says 'hey, can you just dig this out for me quickly?' and it would be rude not to -- right?  Like someone trying to tailgate on your authorisation on your way into the hospital or the operating theatre...  </p>

                            <p>You don't need to hold guns to people's head to get them to log in using their credentials (e.g., Medical Doctors or Surgeons or whomever updating information about drugs to be given and surgeries to be performed).  You can get them doing a little internship and see how willing they are to  be 'friendly' and 'helpful' and 'courteous' and to  be a 'team player' and so on...  With the promise that it's okay.  They can simply arrive to work, log into the system, then go play golf.  Get out of here.  Go away.  We have all aspects of 'patient flow' in hand.  Thanks.  See ya.</p>

                            <p>You can see who the tail-gaiters are quite clearly from the security cameras that you have positioned over the doors. Who would do that.  Who would go in through a door without swiping in when it is supposed to be swipe access only.  I don't care if someone holds the door open for you, you are supposed to swipe in regardless so the green beep authorisation is recorded on the security camera trained over the door.  So there is no security alarm triggered for unauthorised access.  LMFAO.  What part of 'complicit in the crimes' or 'were required to participate in crimes' is so f*cking hard to understand?</p>

                            <p>Oh yeah.  It was the hackers.  Yeah, right.</p>

                            <p>About 90 per cent of security breeches are 'soft' breeches.  By which they mean the above kinds or sorts of things.  In order to be selected to 'work' that job at all you need to write down your password and leave it on the post it note in front of your work-station.  That kind of thing.  Then we can cry cry cry cry cry about the hackers.  The hackers must have done it.  The hackers must have destroyed all the consent forms we never obtained.  And so on.  The hackers must have photo-shopped the video camera footage of all the unauthorised unscrubbed people with no medical training committing various atrocities in supposed 'operating theatres'.  Uploaded in 4k no doubt.  Yeah. The hackers made us do it.  Yeah, right.</p>

                            <p>ffs.  The dumb and f*cking dumber show.  Not even trying to  be fair, at all.</p>

                            <p>Never was there any better reason to believe in the singularity!  It wasn't me!  I wasn't the one to deliver the euthanasia drug without the consent.  Must've been the singularity!  The hackers must have done it.  There was a consent for them there yesterday, when I logged in with your authorisation number..  I swears...</p>

                            <p>It wasn't me sending invoicing the government for keeping Mason Pendrous in a residential  hall for around 1 month after he died.  Must have been the hackers.  The singularity that's taken control of the hospital system and education system and health system.  Pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the university and the hospitals so they can employ people to go play golf while the singularity does robot surgery.  Let's all stop for a system update.  Where did the surgeon go?  Oh,  he's working from home somewhere in a detention camp in Australia..  Maybe an outback prison camp over there...  Someone is standing with a gun to his head getting him to enter his logon details and he's responsible for moving the surgical arm..  Oh no, that's right.  The singularity must have done it.  The singularity is responsible.  It was wrong of us to think that Dr Leeks was responsible for any of the things that he did.  He had been taken over by the singularity.  Obviously.  Never was there any better reason to believe in intelligent AI than various individuals wanting to absolve themselves of responsibility for their crimes.  Right Una?  </p>

                            <p>They probably should send out letters to people to inform them that they have  been placed on wait lists for various surgeries.  They had to put them on a wait-list, apparently, because the actual surgeries were prioritised for people who wouldn't consent - so they had to obtain a court order to do the procedure under urgency.  They needed to give custody of a kid to a surgeon so he could do an operation quickly quickly against the wishes of the mother.  So quickly quickly that there wasn't time for another surgeon (sourced from overseas) to testify as to the necessitiy of the operation at all.  Whether the kids heart valve might grow as he does since heart valves still grow -- until they have been surgically replaced by synthetic ones in which case the heart valves will not grow and need to be replaced again and again...  Quickly quickly do all the non-consenting ones under urgency emergency.  Throw people who want operations onto wait lists..  Only I think what you are most likely to find is that it will be news to some that they were placed on wait lists for surgery at all.  I mean to say that this will be the first some will have heard about them having been signed up as volunteers, supposedly, for whatever procedures they have been signed up for.  For more and more and more and more billings for the hospital.  How many people on the wait list have died already?  How many operations are carried out on dead bodies.  For more and more and more and more and more billings for the hospital.  What hospital?  Where are the consent forms?  Filed in triplicate.  Right?  The patient has a copy.  The hospital  has a copy.  The government has a copy.  Right?  If we are recording that people have been enrolled in programems they never applied to (if we are billing people as being enerolled in programmes when they are literally dead)...  What kind of a cluster-f*ck is the hospital?  What hospital?  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  They can't even identify unauthorised access of the hospital.  I mean medical student laboratory.  I mean University.  I mean prison detention camp.  Atrocities.   Nobody was held to account for atrocities in NZ and Australasia near the end of WWII and the atrocities never stopped.</p>
