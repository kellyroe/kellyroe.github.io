 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container"> 

                            <p> https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/health/patients-waiting-for-surgery-to-be-asked-if-they-still-need-operations/  What seems likely is that a group of people will find out they have  been added to a surgical wait list and this is the first they heard of it.  Why?  Because a group of other people want the operations but they can't have them because there never will be enough to go around etc etc.  You don't get to choose which treatment group you get placed in in the great social experiment that is New Zealand.  What right to refuse to be subject to medical experimentation?  What medicine?  What doctors?  What universities? </p>

                            <p>If children have to wait 'too long' for surgeries they often outgrow the problems.  Like the kid whose heart valves were still growing who was court ordered to have them replaced with synthetic ones (where it was certain the synthetic ones would not grow with him and would need to be replaced again).  The courts awarded custody to the surgeon who wanted to perform the operation.  Quickly quickly quickly no time for another surgeon (from overseas) to testify as to the liklihood of the kid outgrowing the need for the operation.</p>

                            <p>The most important this is to identify what is actually needed -- and ensure that the converse is inflicted.  For most possible harm.  I find it hard to imagine or comprehend much in the way of achieving that aim any better than we are doing at present.  Maybe we are bad at being good.  Or maybe the true intentions become clear.</p>

                            <p>It is great to see NZ has a medical device company in South Auckland to target what might be one of the most vulnerable populations in the world.  Particularly when people in New Zealand do not have the right to opt out or opt off of Medical Experiments.  Do they?  Did that get revoked from our Bill of Rights, yet?  Or are we simply relying (as we usually do) on our Judiciary being unwilling and or unable to uphold any of the laws of New Zealand?  I mean to say, nobody was prosecuted for anything along the lines of 'wrongful death of an infant' when abortion was listed in the crimes act.  Nobody was prosecuted for having performed an abortion even though NZ had one of the highest rates of government paid for abortions performed.  Apparently voluntarily.  Apparently the women were consenting to these procedures being performed as many of them had been non-voluntarily inpregnated in the first place... </p>

                            <p>Anyway, abortion was removed from the crimes act without any public consultation.  Under special conditions of urgency and emergency, one can only suppose.  </p>

                            <p>The Universities of NZ are not processing applications to Medical School according to the objective criterion they publish, supposedly for purposes of their own accountability.  The Judiciary will not uphold the Education and Training Act.  </p>

                            <p>They really just are not even trying to be fair, at all.  </p>

                            <p>Nobody was held to account for WWII atrocities in this part of the world and the atrocities never stopped.  They aren't even trying to be fair at all.</p>

                            <p>It clearly says in the Australian Constitution that NZ is a State of the Federation of Australia.  But the Federal Courts claim that they don't have jurisdiction.  What can you do when the Federal Judges are too f*cking stupid (or something) to parse the constitution they are charged with upholding?  F*cking crazy-land, I tell you what.  There's nothing here.  Not even trying, hey.</p>

                            <p>Abortion is when they remove the foetus (into state care) and tell the mother that it died.  Right?  They say it was not viable outside the womb and put it in a Fisher and Paykal incubator and experiment with how much oxygen to give it (what composition of oxygen and other things) and experiment with how forcefully the inflate the lungs..  Put things in their eyes and see if the cosmetics produce tears and the like...</p>

                            <p>The Universities can't / won't process applications to enrol im Medicine.  The Judiciary can't / won't uphold the laws.  It is in the Australian Constitution that NZ is a State of Australia.  But the Federal Courts refuse to hear cases.  Apparently they are too f*cking stupid to parse their own constitution.  They won't supply birth certificates or passports to people born in NZ.  They won't process applications for University.  What Universities?  Seriously..  THey can't process applications to enrol.  They won't get theses out for external examination.  There's nothing there...  Not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>
