                            <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/492586/lack-of-data-on-medical-workforce-suicides-te-whatu-ora  Nonononono, you have to say it like this 'suicides'.  You can also say it like this 'people who have  been suicided'.  You know, all voluntarily-like.  Of course witnesses might upload evidence of the 'suicide' -- which would be swiftly declared unlawful and taken down.  As would any crime-scene forensic information posted by cleaners, say.  Such that people could consider whether the method claimed by the state appears to be consistent with the footage supplied by third party cameras and the like. </p>

                           <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/492602/thousands-of-acc-cases-probed-for-misuse-but-only-seven-prosecutions  I told ACC about the Auckland District Health Board incorrectly billing for me.  They billed ACC, saying I had conditions and they gave me treatments that were complete and utter fabrications.  I did not sign the consent form for any of it.  It was a complete and utter hoax.  I told the ACC and they just don't care.  It is like when you tell the IRD that the University is trying to have you charged for a programme of study that you never applied to.  They just don't want to hear it.  Unwilling / unable to keep accurate health records.  Of course they want to cry cry cry about the 65+ year old people who are still working to pay the bills.  The issue is not the 65+ people on the payrates that are needed to pay the reasonable bills, in fact.  The issue is the 65+ people on hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.  Judges that are suppose to have gotten out.  45 + years of highly paid employment as Judge ffs.  Time to get out.  Are we really expected to believe that the former speaker of the house was basically forced to be diplomat to Ireland because he's still trying to pay off his f*cking mortgage?  Ffs.  Time to get out.  Kim Sterelny and wife.  How old?  Time to get out.  Ffs.  It isn't exactly rocket science.  Interesting, though, to learn (maybe -- I'm skeptical of stats because they are often made up) that we have a higher proportion of retirement age people who refuse to get out than the USA.  I am interested in the breakdown of that regarding how many of them have been on more than 100,000 per year salaries for at least 10 years. </p>

                           <p>Oh good grief.  YOu  need to look at how the DHB's are billing ACC.  e.g., keeping people for cardiac observation in cardiology rooms when they have no grounds to suspect anything cardiac is wrong with them.  Ramping patients to keep the beds full to maximise their billings.  The cases of apparent or alleged fraud by particular individuals are NOTHING in comparaison to the systematic fraudulent billings by the ACC.  similarly, I would imagine for surgeries that never were performed.  Placebo.  Give anasthetic. Make a surgical cut.  There's your placdebo surgery.  Feel better.  That will be the cost of a full surgery thanks.  Sign off on your surgical training, will we?  Yeah, right...</p>

                           <p>I guess the issue for me is the realisation that there simply isn't anything in healthcare or education..  Anything to do with vulnerable people.  Students.  Sick people.  Poor people.  Ethnic minority people. There just isn't any kind of shortage at all of people wanting to see the vulnerable targets and get in there and take them for everything they have got.  We won't pay anybody to work those jobs (for or in the interests of the above people) becuase there never will be any kind of shortage at all of psychopaths who want to get in there and exploit them for everything they have.  So...  The positions will be filled with psychopaths.  Volunteers.  People who will yes sir yes sir everything you say sir in exchange for getting to do anything anything anything.  </p>

                           <p>The recent inquiry into abuse in state care shows the lengths that the NZL government and judicary will go to to ensure that NZ is the destination location for abusers and offenders and psychopaths and pedophiles...  It simply won't do anything about historic cases, even, and there is no intention whatsover of stopping with present abuses or developing any kind of education and training system or professional graduates with professsional careers.  There simply isn't anything here and there is no desire to develop, at all.  Can't function.  Taken over by psychopaths.</p>
