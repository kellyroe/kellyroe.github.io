                             <p> https://www.seek.com.au/job/71065105?type=standard#sol=4c1e511462decafef3672c220c38876082e3a79b  Wow.  There we go.  A positive response to my 2018 thesis.  An honest effort to try and do things properly.  Whether you trust them to do what they say is, of course, a different matter from whether they are saying the right things.  They are at least trying to say the right things, however.  IMHO.  I don't see much or any of that in Australasia.  That seems to be the message loud and clear.  Forced to try to go to the US if you want a chance of an 'ordinary life'.  Isn't that the marketing, now?  Don't you know there's a war on?  Australasia seems to have declared war on it's own people.  It's soooo hostile and soooo competitive.  Divide and conquer.  Sow seeds of dissention (no no no no no what are you going to do about it you and whose army wrong wrong no no no) and distrust. </p>

                             <p>It is kind of a draft.  In how to handle requests for information about those sorts of things given that it is unconstitutional (because immoral) to discriminate against people on the basis of those kinds of things.  You don't need to explain to..  Some people..  That it is immoral.  You don't need to explain what immoral means.  You can write a thesis (like I did) and this be the response.  A sort of 'yes, and what are we going to do to try and make things better'.  It isn't about the specific job.  It is about getting the request (REQUEST) for information (PROVIDED VOLUNARILY) right.  Also limiting the amount of paperwork -- aka limiting the amount of information that is asked for that is irrelevant or not needed.</p>

                             <p>Unlike NZ where (in the very near future) we may need to provide a list of 500 non-relatives and their NZ passport information before they will process an appplication for a passport.  No?  Just the one?  But why stop there?  Why not 2?  Why stop there?  Why not 500?  Why not just take and take and take money for application processing and then not deliver any outcome?  What's to stop it?  You and whose army?  There just really doesn't seem to be anything here, most of the time.  No hint of try.</p>

                             <p>How low you have to keep everybody else so that you can claim to be the best...</p>

                             <p>I guess you don't pay me enough.  Interesting the choices that various people make and have made in response to that.  How low can we go etc.  Not much in the way of anything left.</p>
