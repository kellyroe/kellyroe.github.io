                            <p>  The Court of Appeal has deemed my filings abandoned because I failed to pay them $7,060 security for costs that they demanded.  They asserted that they did not see public interest or merits to the case.  I post my filings here so the reader can judge for themselves whether or not it is a matter of public interest that the Univesrity of Otago is refusing to supply applications to enrol, is throwing away applications to enrol rather than considering applications on merit, and is upfront about collecting disability information for the purposes of exlusion only:

                                The Universities of Otago and Auckland are not being fair as to how they are choosing what students to enrol in Medicine.  It wasn't that Dr Leeks happened to slip through a selection criterion or process objectively and fairly applied.  It was that he was hand-picked or specially chosen for demonstrating all the qualities they value.  I suppose, then, he was transferred to Melborne because that is also what they value over there.  I don't see what else we are supposed to think about that when they harbor him they way they have chosen to.  He doesn't get to be too sick to stand trial.  He is not worthy of consideration that he refused to show his victims.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The Universities and courts have broken the social contract.  The Courts have chosen to set precedent that it will cost upwards of $20,000 to take a case against the Univesrity to the High COurt and the High Court will not uphold Justice.  
                                </p>

                                <p>New Zealand keeps detention / slave camps.  New Zealand is a state of Australia.  Australia chooses to supply New Zealand Dollars to New Zealanders to prevent them travelling domestically and to disguise how low the wages are kept in New Zealand.  They will not pay the teachers, police, nurses, etc.  They do not value the lives of New Zealanders.  They keep slave / dention camps.  They do not allow qualification progression and completion.  They are not fair in their allocation of training places.  They are not fair in their process of advertising (if they even do) or appointing people for paid jobs.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                New Zealand sometimes cons and swindles making false promises.  Then arranging for people to be involuntarily detained (before or after having been raped) and deported with no pay. If not outright suicided or murdered.  Simply vanish when it's time for you to be paid.  New Zealand also intentionally aims to attract people who believe they have no other option.  People who don't get to immigrate to the USA or Australia or Canada or the UK.  They intentionally want those people because they think that these people are particularly susceptible to the brain-washing about them being of little to no value.  New Zealand likes to treat them as slaves and thinks it can profiteer considerably from their low self esteem.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The reason why I wanted to go to the USA instead of hurring through my PhD from Honors in New Zealand is because I wanted to learn more.  And New Zealand won't employ the skilled and knowledgable people in the Universities here.  It is the hiring decisions that they choose to make.  Again, they have our people employed believing they are only employed here because they would not be employed anywhere else.  They won't make it possible or attractive for people to come here for sabattical for a time, even, so our students can learn in that way.  We won't develop graduate level curriculum.  We won't actually listen to the reasons why people want to go and start developing and offering those things here.  Instead, we have chosen to really take the low road and force people to stay.  If people won't choose to stay here and be abused then we will keep them as slaves properly, then.  The real low road.  
                                </p>
                        

                                <p> I put in an application to do another PhD with the ANU last year to see what would happen with it.  When I applied I said I was not really interested in starting over, and was more interested in recieving credit for the work I had done for them already.  I said I wanted to study Medicine.  Only I wasn't sure if there was any Medicine because there isn't any respect, at all, for informed consent.  So, there aren't 'cervical examinations' there are 'sexual assaults' and there aren't 'surgeries' there are 'physical assaults' and so on.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I find myself thinking 'there is no excuse for threats of violence'.  But I also find myself wondering what options there are for students or employees or slaves or volunteers when people who have kept them working or studying do not honor terms and when the courts refuse to uphold the law.  It might be possible to escape.  1/4 of the population of New Zealand has fled.  I find myself thinking 'it's the brain drain' and I find myself thinking about the brain drain 'if you have any brains then you will flee far away from here'.  And I find myself then thinking about flocks of migrants who are treated horribly everywhere they go.  False promises of a better life and then being kept as second or third class citizens.  And I wonder why it is that those who are wronged should be forced to flee and why it is that those who are doing the wrongs should  be allowed to persist in their wrongs.  
                               </p>

                               <p>
                                The Education and Training Act 2020 and the Education Acts prior to that all stated that domestic adults who had attained the age of 20 years were eligible to  be enrolled in the programme they applied to.  They stated that teenagers (under the age of 20 years) were able to be enrolled by the University only if the University was satisfied that they were able to complete the course.  So, when we hear of a Univerity being satisfied enough that a teenager could complete the course so as to enrol them and take their money and we then hear of the University failing them for their course not only once, but two years in a row, then it really looks like the University has some explaining to do as to how it was that they could not pass the student.
                               </p>

                               <p>
                                The High Court of Dunedin did not see it that way because the Judges are themselves involved in this process of bullying and abusing those who have  been wronged.  They think their job is to help the powerful be more powerful.  They don't appear to have a sense or conception of justice, at all.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The University of Otago is not processing applications to enrol properly.  They are not grading properly, either.  The reason why Universities do not give students back their work alongside grading schedules is to hide and conceal the evidence of them grading students work differently from teh grading schedules.  Published class lists make up studnets and information (e.g., saying that a certain number of students in the class were given A+ grades when that is not possible on that assignment without cheating).  They ask impossible questions in multiple-choice sometiems where the only way you could get that correct is by luck or by someone having given you the arbitrary answer in advance. They do this so as to give hardworking and motivated students poor grades.  It is part of the bullying and abuse that they do to have studnets feel inferior.  It is not an education system or a training program in anything other than having students settle for low to no paid work.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                When there is no justice then what are you supposed to do?  You could flee...  But why should you flee?  What is this?  The Ukrane?  That is...  Unfortunate terrain.  Given it's central location and the presence of nuclear storage facility.  I don't see similar pressures on getting people to leave New Zealand.  I don't know if there are indigenous people of Ukrane who are being displaced.  But this is the homeland of Maaori and they are recognised as an indigenous population internationally.  People shouldn't be forced to flee New Zealanders because of all these people who have been paid for their working lives already who refuse to share the wealth around, who refuse to train a new workforce, and who refuse to stand down.  When they refuse to listen to or progress complaints.  When they insist on treating people unfairly.  When the judiciary fails to uphold justice.  When people get sick and tired of running away (or when Covid restrictions prevent people from fleeing so that people are required to stand up for themselves back home) then what do people have to do for things to change?  They seem determined to force acts of terrorism.  They refuse to listen to the people. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The University of Auckland is required to apply the algorithm they published for the purposes of selection and enrol me if and only if my rank order score is high enough for enrolment.  If they don't do this then it would be better for the Universities of New Zealand to be shut down.  We don't have Universities.  We have slave / detention camps only.  The Australian National Univesrity, too, does not seem to be making enrolment decisions on the basis of merit.  My 2021 application for PhD was declined.  Apparently I haven't done enough high quality work to even START a PhD.  Compare all my written work with the written work supplied by the students they chose to enrol to start their PhD this year.  I had a publication with Oxford Univesrity Press but apparently that isn't good enough for them.  Decide for yourself the quality and integrity of a 'University System' who refuses to process or progress students on the basis of academic merit and where, more particularly, the people paid to teach and train speak to their students the way that Sterelny choses to speak to me.  People are waiting for him to die so that a few more people can have jobs.  He did not do his job supervising me.  What do they pay him for?
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                There is a conversation that I remember.  It was some time ago, and I may remember it a bit wrongly.  I think that Sterelny said that Australian PhD students had things a bit better than New Zealand PhD students because New Zealand has the incentive structure all wrong.  Australian Universities got money from the Government for completed PhD's.  So there was an incentive for the department to get students work out to externals when they thought it would be passed and they were pleased to get the thesis finished up.  Or maybe that was his aspirational goal.  And that wasn't really how things were in Australia.  Maybe that was an idea that he was putting out there, as to what it would take for a department to be happy and pleased and proud to see their students actually completing their PhD.  He said that New Zealand Universities got money for enrolment.  The joke was 'keeping the bums on the seats'.  It was a bit of a joke because that's how the Ministry or whoever decides the incentive structure viewed or treated students. As bums.  To be kept paying the University paying the University and where the Government would pay the University as well in order to keep the bums on the seats.  
                                </p>

                                <p>It does cost money to train people.  But training schemes are scummy scams when you pay them and they put you to work and they don't pay you for the work that you do -- rather they pay you and instead of training you they put you to work.  What taught courses did I get to do while I was working on my PhD?  The USA gave me some.  That was why I wanted to go there by preference.  I wanted 2 years more courses.  Where knowledgable people are paid to teach me what knowledge they have.  Where I learn what they know.  Instead of simply being put to work.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Apparently Hipkins (or the Ministry he is spokes-person for) isn't content with them having ruined the University System, they are setting about to ruin the trades sysem as well.  Previously we relied on migrant workers to slave for less than minimum wage on construction jobs.  Now the borders are closed.  Nations are preventing us from keeping slaves.  So we need to get domestic workers to work those jobs.  Instead of paying the workers to work those jobs we will pay construction companies $1,000 per week to have a first year student and $500 per week to have a second year student.  So we create an incentive structure for them to fail first year studnets to make them repeate the first year.  Do that until we have used up their 'lifetime entitltement to education' we call it.  That's a very very low road to growth, indeed.  Training costs money, you say?  Well lets see an account of where they are spending the $1,000 they get for every student.  What teachers are they hiring to teach them?  What is their curriculum?  What skills are signed off as being skills they can do independently?
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                It isn't a training system or an apprenticeship system unless it is actually training them.  And then actually signing them off.  Why would they sign off the apprentice when they can collect up more and more and more money from the government and the student both for refusing to sign off on completion of the qualification?  New Zealand does not have a training system.  It won't give out the qualifications once people have done the training.  They say we can't give them qualifications because they don't know anything.  If that is true it is only because they refused to teach them anything.  They are holding hostages only.  Hipkins says there are no plans to bond apprentices to New Zealand.  But that is because there are no plans to sign them off.  There are no plans to sign off on their qualification completions.  They do the work while they pay for 'training' and the Government pays their employer.  Their employer has no incentive to hire a skilled workforce when the government gives them hand-outs to keep slaves.  To keep the people as bums (unemployed, borrowing for student loans) and never signing off on their qualifications.  They won't leave and practice anywhere else because we won't give them qualifications.  When it's time for us to graduate them it's time for them to suicide from injury or die or give up voluntarily.  Maybe be disabled or irrational.  Maybe drug abuse (maybe a ketamine prescription or some LSD) maybe imprisoned for something...  Standing trial.  Deported.  The lengths we will go to to not pay the workers.  New Zealand won't pay the workers.  New Zealand will pay the slavers.  Do you want to be a slaver?  Then things are looking up for you!  Move to New Zealand!  Best nation in the world in which to engage in child trafficking etc.  UPloaded to 5G cloud storage, no doubt.  All secure, like.   
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                They can't hire people to teach them, apparently.   Because we don't have any knowledgeable people, in New Zealand.  Certain people are paid big money, big money, indeed, to keep hostages / run slaves.  That is New Zealand.  The slave labor detention camp of Australia.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I don't know what has happened to Australia in more recent years.  I think it seems to have gone the same way as New Zealand.  I guess it used New Zealand as a pilot study or a test case or something like that.  Then it decided to take some of the offenders or people who were willing to take more than their share to engage in or participate in such a system and it imported them from New Zealand to Australia.  So, Harlene Hayes.  Western Australia is promising to take students their first year out of Secondary School and train them to do Medicine.  I suppose it's the Otago alumni with money who previously paid Otago money to expediate the selection of their teenagers.  They will get Australian Dollars out of them for expediating their teenagers, now.  I don't know if that means Otago is freer than it was from that old-money entltled however many generations off the first ship sort of investment...  Then those kids can be put to work performing wrongful deaths and so on on the miners and aboriginal populations.  Just brilliant.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I don't know what it is with Sterelny saying his former students (the New Zealand ones) often don't get jobs.  I don't know why he would bother to even graduate his New Zealand students given that New Zealand wont' give them jobs.  On the other hand, I made it clear I didn't want a job in philosophy (other people do -- so that's good, right?  Given that there aren't enoguh jobs in Philosophy for everyone who wants one it's good that someone realises they don't want one and moves aside for other people -- right)?  So then if I don't want a job in Philsophy I must  be forced to do the work as slave.  Right?  I must be forced to do the law work as slave?  There is no precedent in New Zealand for self represented litigants to be awarded costs.  Certainly not awarded anything for their labor.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The New Zealand Government has chosen to create and impose incentive structures incentivising slavery.  Preventing and prohibiting the developoment of training systems and skilled labor.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I do feel that New Zealand is punishing me.  I completed my BA and Hons and I could have applied to Medicine at that point.  Or I could have applied to do a PhD in New Zealand at that point.  I said I wanted to go to the USA.  Why?  Because I wanted to learn more.  Doing a PhD was being put to work writing a thesis.  I wanted to do more classes and learn more.  I also didn't feel ready to be put to work as a Medical doctor in the next few years if I were selected for that training program.  Instead of New Zealand offering me enrolment in courses during my PhD or doing a student exhange to USA for 1 year for some course-work (as Australia allowed me to do) they didn't offer me anything.  They didn't ask me why I wanted to leave to see if there was a way to help me want to stay.  They just got butt-hurt about it and got busy figuring how to ensure that people didn't have options anymore by stabotaging under-graduate grades.  Now that I know I'm capable of studying Medical Curriculum (after working independently on USMLE study material) and working through various things in my own life they are determined I do not get to be enrolled in that program.  We can see it isn't about developing a skilled workforce at all.  It is about the keeping of slaves.  They choose to pull Judges out of retirement and pay them.  Not because they are competent, often becuase they are not.  They choose to pay them rather than appointing new judges so that there are jobs for other people in New Zealand.  They just won't do it.

                                I wonder how many hostages Harvard has this year.  Harvard and MIT.  How many New Zealand people were sent to them who they are supposed to graduate.  Why would they graduate them?  Why wouldn't they demand that Jacinda pay them 2x the fees that were cited otherwise they will simply fail the students?  We are talking about the children of the people who paid Crimson Education etc to ensure their children bribed their way into priority entrance at US schools.  How much additional money are they now required to pay to the US Universities for their 2 year Masters in Public Health or 2 year Masters in Law, or whatever.  The Children of the public officials in New Zealand who sent their children overseas for a Private School Education with their salaries that are, effectively, tax-payers dime.  Why would Harvard treat New Zealand studnets any better than New Zealand treats it's own studnets?  Why would Harvard treat New Zealand students any better than New Zealand treats it's on international students?  Would you like to do business with New Zealand?

                                <p>Dodgey dealings were done...  Something about John Key and Crimson Education...  The basic scummy scam is to get people paying money to 'Education' start-up companies, or whatever.  Then they can sell the students answers to various things.  Maybe they can sell them a reference to a US school.  Maybe they can sell them the answers to HSFY tests of examinations.  Maybe the current students can sell them answers in the name of 'tutoring'.  20 Million has just  been announced for IT computer technology education and training.  Nikki Kaye just announced her intention to start up a business to do with that.  Is that how the government procurement for training works?  We want to keep student slaves in or for IT, now?  Sounds like just the kind of scummy scam that the Ministries would choose to throw millions of dollars of investment funding into.  I don't know if the idea is that they don't actually deliver the money they say they will (e.g., the Ministry of heatlh does not get the money to the hospitals, the Ministry of education does not get the money to the universities) or how much the corruption is within the institutions themselves.  I guess everybody takes a piece of the pie.  Except for the slave workers, of course.  Who must be intellectually handicapped or disabled or irrational or whatever you have to call them to hide and conceal the keeping of slaves.  Right?

                                <p>The aged care employers have told the Minister that they need to *force* migrant workers to work that job.  They won't work that job if they have an option.  You need to *force* them to work that job and deport them if they won't.  They are here solely for the purposes of working that job.  And if they want to stop working that job they need to be deported immediately.  They need to run off back home and tell everybody over there about the atrocities, I suppose.  But, of course, we try  and only take immigrants from nations when we think their governments won't do anything.  How low can we go, again?  Think lower..  Think lower than lower than low...   When you opt out of PISA testing (as a nation) then you opt out of being paid for international students.  When you have the highest rates of child abuse and you aren't teaching your students what are you doing?  Child trafficking for abuse?  What the  hell, New Zealand.

                                We don't have laws requiring people to report abuse becuase we want people to be kept in abusive environments.  We refuse to uphold international practices around whistleblowers (Chris Whelan hasn't progressed a single whistleblower complaint since he was appointed to the Tertiary Education sector in 2014).  We don't pay the teachers at the best of times (remember during the start of Labors first term how the teachers did not get paid for months.  Months and months.  They did not pay them.  Apparently they are still at it.  They refuse to acknowledge NZ University qualification completions so that they under-pay the teachers.)  We don't want people reporting abuse.  Oraka Tamariki is not about removing kids from abusive environments.  It is about uplifting kids who they feel are not being sufficiently abused at home to ensure that they are abused.  If you think of the aim or the goal or the point or the purpose as a system that is trying to arrange for as many to be kept abused and in as much deprivation as possible then that really makes the best sense of what is going on.  Various things click into place in the understanding.  We can see why it is that they make the various choices that they make.

                                <p>If you want a job as a philosopher, in New Zealand, then maybe  you could be an ethics person writing about how it is a good idea to have a little mark or label by the name of the kids who have been subject to abuse.  We can track them over time.  We have decided they are required to suffer.  Intergenerationally.  We expect the effects of the abuse they have suffered to be intergenerational.  We don't need to progress or process the applications from the kids so marked.  For education or employment.  THey have been marked as slave.  Right?  Dispensible.  That is why the police check form asks whether the police have recorded a little mark by the applicants name saying that they have been abused (in state care, for instance) which means they have been marked, forever, as the underclass.  They are not processing or progressing anything properly.  From grading students work to letting students submit exams to enrolling students to employing workers.  New Zealand is not a functioning developed nation at all.  There is nothing here.  Worse...  We don't appear to be doing anything at all when it comes to improving things and moving things in the right direction.

                                Chris Whelan (his charming self) isn't off to South America to see what kids he can find to traffic to New Zealand for purposes of abuse in a nation where we regard people who report abuse to be whistle-blowers who themselves must be punished and ostracised.  This time we are sending Chris Hipkins.  He can explain to the people of South America how there isn't enough room in our schools to train all our domestic kids.  HOw we had the best Covid response in the world, apparently, but we won't participate meaningfully in international assessments of educational attainment (reading, writing, literacy) but they are supposed to pay us money and hand over children so they can come be 'educated' in the nation that has the highest rate of child abuse in the world.  Does this seem even slightly plausible or credible at all?

                                <p>New Zealand does not have a shortage of people with skills.  It simply refuses to pay people to do skilled labor or skilled work.  It won't pay them.  It won't acknowledge qualifications and training.  It won't pay them to do skilled work.  It will force people to do the work for free or cheap or while paying them and for the most part the work simply isn't done at all.  We don't have doctors.  We have actors.  For example.  Just get in there and have a go.  Do your best.  Just do what you are told.  The managment or administration told you what to do / what to say / where to move the patient to / where to detain the patient / what prescription to sign off on.  And you do what you are told.  Until it is time for you to go away.  They pull judges out of retirement (paying them) rather than appointing new judges.  They pay Ashley Bloomfield more than Fauci.  The choices they make.  I don't see how it is possible to function here.

                                <p>I don't know if the Australian National University will put things right.  The University of Waikato.  The University of Auckland.  The University of Otago.  The New Zealand Vice Chancellor's Committee.  They don't seem to care at all if the Governments or the people come to learn that they are not being fair at all in the way they are giving or withholding of enrolments, progressions, completions.  They make decisions on the basis of non-academic reasons and they make decisions that are against best academic practice.  They don't seem to be academic institutions at all.  They have been quite hijacked for a different agenda entirely.
