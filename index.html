                            <p>Overseas is surprised that we give students secondary school course credit for activities that overseas considers 'extra-curricular'.  That's just what we do when we dump the curriculum.  Replace it with extra-curriculars.  We'll be allocating grades on the basis of who has the most like share and subscribes, soon.  That's how the managers choose who to hire for the employment positions -- right?  That's how we pick a prime minister?  I guess it would be surprising to the developed world that people would be trying to get 13 and 14 year old kids (that is the age for social studies curriculum) doing volunteer work.  Training them for a life of work for no pay.  I think it was the girl scouts that used to have badges for helping others.  Brownies.  Scouts.  Something like that.  Hey, that's a great idea!  We can stop paying the teachers and have the volunteers of those programme train the kids to volunteer, in turn...  Good thinking!!!</p>

                            The writing page contains a variety of writing samples where I am the first, or only author.  The samples range from fairly tightly written technical pieces in philosophy and psychology to longer explorations or investigations where the role of the philosopher is supposed to be the 'critic and conscience of society'.  You will find samples of my undergrad and honors research and coursework.  A MA thesis, MPhil thesis, PhD thesis.  A co-authored book chapter.
                            </p>

                            The seminars page contains more than a dozen seminars that were presented to departmental seminars or international conferences.  I have provided the written version of the talk and powerpoint presentation for the majority of them.  </p>

                            <p>The teaching page provides a list of courses I have taught and the subject contents that I was sub-contracted to develop to help the students understand the contents of a texbook that I was told to teach from.</p>

                            <p>The judicial review page provides a list of legal proceedings that I have filed with various courts of New Zealand.  Presently, the Social Security Appeals Authority is required to pass judgment on whether or not the Ministry of Social Development's decision to refuse to provide advance benefit payment for security for costs set by court of appeal on grounds that 'Justice is not an essential need' is to be upheld or to be overturned.  There was a substantive hearing of this matter in September of 2022 and judgment is awaited.</p>

                            <p>Neil Quigley instructed me to complain to the Office of the Ombudsman and then take the University to Court if I was unhappy with how the University of Waikato handled my enrolment etc in 2018-2019.  I was very unhappy with them (1) refusing to enrol me in the programme I applied to (2) recording I  had been enrolled in programmes I never applied to.  (3)  Refusing to get a thesis that I submitted for examination out to external examiners so as to prevent them accepting it.  (4)  Sending a thesis I submitted for MPhil examination out for 'doctoral reports' to be written (sending it out to be examined for the wrong degree).  (5)  Refusing to base the outcome of external examination on the reports of external examiners.  How could any of this be considered acceptable?  Justice Toogood was reappointed from his retirement to write reports on the untimely deaths of Mason Pendrous and Olivia Podmore.  Both of whom died in state care (care of the Univeristy of Canterbury and Cycling NZ, respectively).  He was also given his day in court hearing Roe v University of Waikato legal proceedings. </p>

                            <p>The University of Auckland advised me that I needed to have completed a qualification within the last 5 years to be 'eligible' to study MBChB.  That was why I applied to do a 120 point MPhil with Waikato in 2018 and that was why I handed them a 50,000 word MPhil Thesis on September 14 of 2018.  Waikato refused to get that thesis out to externals.  They are not functioning as a University, at all.  It turns out that the Education and Training Act states that domestic adults are eligible to be  enrolled in the programme they applied to.  I applied to MBChB and I am a domestic adult who is over 20.  I mean to say that the statutory law of NZ says that I am eligible.  The Univesrity of Auckland had no right to throw my application away on grounds that they deemed me 'ineligible'.  They were required to process my application same as everybody else.  Enter my GPA, UMAT / UCAT score, interview score into their algorithm and offer me a place or not on the  basis of my rank order score.  Firstly, they entered incorrect information into my GPA field to try and tell me that my GPA wasn't good enough.  Then they simply refused to enter my GPA at all.  Apparently they just pick and choose whoever they want for whatever arbitrary reasons they want.  How is that working out for NZ?  Dr Leeks.  He wasn't picked becuase his rank order score was high enough.  He was picked on personal grounds for all the qualities they value.  Dr  Green (the pathologist who watched Maaori die without intervention).  Professor Glue.  All these people hand picked for all the qualities they value for Medical Doctors, in NZ.  Hand picked.  Exceptional.  Exceptions.  Each and every one of them.  It's all very very very very very very personal. </p>

                            <p> New Zealand does not seem to have a functioning tertiary education system.  The 'Universities' are not processing applications to enrol.  They are not acknowledging progression through training programmes.  They are not graduating people who have done the work for their degrees.  I am trying to remember whether ANY of the students at the Australian National University actually had their work go out for external examination at all, or whether the University simply decided that they had done enough for their degrees.  The Australian National University kept Carl Brusse re re re enrolled for more than 10 years as a doctoral student.  Correct?  How many times over did he write doctoral theses for the Australian National University while they only take more and more and more money from the government for keeping him re re re re enrolled.  So that his supposed 'supervisors' can be paid hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of base salary and research funding.  While they refuse to do the supervision job for which they are paid (where is the evidence of my being supervised?  Evidence of meetings?  Evidence of written comments on my written work?)   What education and training system?</p>

                            <p>Where does all the money go?  Half a million for Una Jagose.  Half a million for Ashley.  Each and every year.  Quarter of a million for Chris Whelan to take complaints he receives about the Universities of NZ and throw them away (to ensure his statutory function is not filled by him, is not filled by anybody at all).  Is Geoffrey Palmer still on government payroll?  How about his son?  They are both of them over the age of 65, aren't they?  The Judge who makes his career proclaiming and pronouncing judicial review of administrative action to be without teeth and removal from office (a remedy listed in the HIgh Court Rules) to be obsolte.  That's what obsolete meeeeeeeans.  To be listed in the laws of NZ.  All of the laws are obsolete, I suppose, since the NZ judiciary seems carefully exceptionally  hand-picked all chosen specially for the reason that they are unwilling and or unable to even parse the laws.  Lacking in the most basic reading comprehension.  </p>
