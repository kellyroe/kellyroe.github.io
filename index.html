                                <a href="https://kellyroe.github.io/writing/realmecv.pdf">Chronological CV</a>

                             <p>D&D RECONCIEVED.  AKA:  WHAT WOULD JESUS DO??</p>

                             <p>Okay...  So this is a mock article-y thing.  Thingamie bob.  Whatsit.  There is this idea or a meme or whatever or whathave you of What Would Jesus Do?  Now, I bring to you, a riff, or variant on the theme.  And my riff, or variant, goes like this: What Would Dr Leeks Do?</p>

                             <p>What is the point of this?  Well..  I guess the idea is that one imagines Jesus for the 'good' or the 'kind' or the 'benevolent' or the 'psychologically mature' option.  *Good vibes*.  You get the idea.  </p>

                             <p>And I want to contrast with that...  Something else.  And there are various things I could have picked or chosen...  One of them (traditionally) would have been Satan.  But, then, I ask you to think of what hell Satan represented...  And I ask you to invisage that, as well as you can, as being something that exists upon earth.  And, well, many people have heard something of the things that Dr Leeks did or allowed to be done or arranged to have done and so on and so forth..  To children.  And I ask of you, as best you can, to empathise.  You know, show your supreme and superior emotional intelligence or power of rationality or whatever it is that allows you to project yourself into the place of the children... And to, then, consider, from their point of view...</p>

                             <p>And so now I have described to you.  The idea.  The ideology.  Of What Dr Leeks Would Do.</p>

                             <p>So we are fairly clear and all on the same page.  Now that is done and we can move on to the next step of the 'game' or 'situation' or what have you.</p>

                             <p>PART TWO:</p>

                             <p>Now I ask..  Now I ask of you..  What is it.. What is it that Dr Leeks would do...  With the game of D&D?</p>

                             <p>I put that to you.</p>

                             <p>What is it that Dr Leeks would do?</p>

                             <p>ANSWER:  FIRST PASS</p>

                             <p>Firstly, we are going to have to sexualise this game.  Voluntarily.  That is what the children want.  To play a sexualised game.  Dr's and Nurses, if you will.  The children require it.  The game will be, can be played, no other way.  </p>

                             <p>ANSWER:  FIRST PASS</p>

                             <p>Riffing on the theme of firstly...  What the children want (in fact) -- it becomes increasingly obvious to me, in my role as Psychiatrist or Clinical Psychologist or Teacher or One with All Power Over You...  Is...  Oh my god!!! It just so happens to turn out (all voluntary-like) to be everything I have ever fantisized about!  All my hopes! All my desires!  All my dreams!  Everything I have ever fantisized about!!! I should really get government funding for helping me helping me helping me help myself to them...  I feel so much better for all the play time that I have with them.  For their own good, obviously.  Their psychopathology.  They are such attention seekers, obviously!  The problem with them (insofar as they have a problem) is that they will do anything anything anyting for the highest bidder..  And ooooh I forsee a situation where someone may outbid me!  Oh noes!  They need treatment from me, clearly, to see the error of their ways...  </p>
