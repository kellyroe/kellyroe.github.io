                                That's considerably more than 50,000  words of research output in one year?  This is years after I give him a more than 100,000 words thesis document that he never gave me supervisory comments on and he never gave to externals to examine.  I'll just keep giving him more than 50,000 words of reseach every year and he can...  Reattribute authorship to others?  Is that the idea? I suppose the point of him emailing me this was that I was supposed to cry cry cry and plead about how I'd do anything anything anything not to be cut from the programme.  He was fishing for me to send him more work.  So he could redistribute it to others so they could claim the research output.
</p>

<p>E.g., John Matthewson took credit for publishing work on dysfunction.  Fiona MacPhearson took my seminar handouts and was very interested in what she told me was a new topic for her (delusion).  She asked me to send her stuff for co-authorship.  She then started giving seminar talks about publication that she had written without crediting or acknowledging me, at all.  I don't know how much more of that there is because I don't read their work outputs.  They don't pay me to read their outputs.  Their outputs are mostly kept behind paywall which makes sense of why they don't want me having University affiliation anymore.  Kim would say that anything more than 5 years old is considered abandonware.  So they only need delay publication for 5 years before they feel entitled to reattribute authorship.</p>


<p>I did not see any of the students (not Rachel Brown, not Nick Southwood) with reports from external examiners.  I did not see either of them (or anybody else) defend their thesis publically after receiving external examiners reports.  I did not see anybody graduate.  Did anybody?  How did they decide who to publically credit with PhD?  Did they credit anybody?  Various people found their way onto payroll, allegedly or apparently.  Apparently various people are on payroll.  But I'm just expected to keep handing over my work for no pay.  What Universities?  </p>

<p>Tahua O'Leary...  I was told that the external examiners accepted the thesis they were sent from him without requesting any changes or alterations to the thesis.  The University would not get his work out for external examination until he had been working on it for how many..  Decades?  And then the external examiners did not find so much as a typographical error?  Not so much as a single misplaced apostrophe?  They couldn't find even 1 reference they thought should be added?  I mean to say it's more likely that they never sent it out for external examination at all than that externals had nothing at all to say.  It's not very psychologically plausible to think that an external examiner wouldn't find something to pick.  To justify their extistence as external.  What happened to or with an oral defence?  When was that scheduled?  The public defence?  What Universities?</p>

<p>I found the following little bits.  You can really follow my CV on the 'descent into madness' or similar, that there is.  Not really a 'descent into madness' but taking...  What was that?  One of the best students they've ever seen and bullying them into outputting work that was garble.  That's the idea.  Right?  How many years of ignoring research output.  What University?  They say everybody has one book in them.  I suppose by that they mean that you kill someone (fail them out or bully them away) and you take their work as a trophy and pass it off as your own.  Right?  Just the one.  Enough for tenure.  Like how Dr Leeks was most revered for being a pedophile. Know who else is most valued?  Plagarisers.  People who will take their students work and pass it off as their own and fail their studnets else bully them into fleeing.  What University?  </p>

<p>You just go 'no no no no no' re-write it different.  You just keep saying that.  Pick out every second sentance and go 'no, where is the evidence for that'? And so on.  Kim Sterelny thinks that Philosophy is bio-technology where anything more than 5 years old is obsolete.  Of course.  Plato and Aristotle are so last year.  That's why he takes the philosophy out of philosophy so he can claim that.  Claim to be too f*ckign stupid to see patterns of yesteryear.  Of course it's only my work that dates.  Becomes dated.  When it's time for him to get it to externals if he's too f*cking psychopathic to do his f*cking job.  Apparently (the fake news says) the ANU has another NZ student, now, working on the prison detention hostage refugee camps of Australia.  They think it's funny to keep a NZ pet hostage workign on that within the fine institution of the ANU.  Quite the trophy for them or similar.</p>

<p>Kim Sterelny had only a small handful of graduate research studnets.  He had no teaching.  He only had to supervise our work to completion.  ANd he takes and he takes and he takes and he takes and he takes.  And he won't (else can't) talk about any of his work that was done more than about 5 years ago.  Likely becuase..  He doesn't understand it.  He probably wasn't the author of it, at all.  I wonder if Frank Jackson was.  Or how or why he's saying that he's co-authoring various things with Kim Sterelny.  It just doesn't make any sense at all.</p>

<p>What University?  For all the EFTS of enrolment..  Australasia..  For all the studnets you claim to have enrolled in graduate research qualifications -- where is the research output?  Where the hell is it?  All the 50,000 word masters theses?  The 50,000 words of research output every f*cking year.  For how many years is someone supposed to demonstrate their capacity before they get publically acknowledged and payroll for f*cks sake.  Kim is over 65 and it's time to go.  Get the f*ck out.  You f*cking psychopath.  Get the f*ck out.</p>

                             </p> 

        <p>The law and medicine assignments (above) make it clear they are vocational training and not academic oriented.  They won't allow you to reference properly (no direct quotation).  They want you to do what the government says when the government says because the government says.  I think they are being more blatent now about students being required to volunteer to go collect survey data etc.  Make up survey data.  Etc.  For the first year Medical Degree.  Sorry.  'Medical Degree'.  
        </p>

        <p>It's so obviously a 'I'm a gamma baby' degree.  Else...  I was picked out (all Stanford Prison Experiment, like) to be over-lord.  They have learned how you pick out a few all arbitrarily to manage the masses (in the name of trickle down economics) and, of course, with that set-up it won't take very long at all before the elite few start bashing and beating and blaming the majority for being..  Losers.  Isn't that right, Sterelny?</p>

        <p>The NZ Philosophy people started telling me that there would be a job for me only over their dead bodies when I was in my Honors year.  When they started hearing me give seminars at conferences etc.  That's what they said to me.  There would be a job for me only over their dead bodies.  Now, many of them are over 65 - and they won't get out.  So seems that that is right.  They actually need to die, or something, before there can be a job for me.  Is that actually right?</p>

        <p>I said I wanted to do Medicine.  I was no threat to them.  I wasn't after their job.  I wasn't after funding for or from philosophy.  I could go study Medicine and see about getting funding from there..  But even that wasn't good enough for them.  It wasn't about withholding employment in Philosophy, specifically, it seems. It was more about generally.  Just generally.  They liked where I was positioned (under them) on the social hierarchy, or something.  And I'd only get out from under their thumb when they were dead.  I suppose it was more that that was the idea.</p>

        <p>Why don't I have a payroll?  Where is my money for all of the work that I've done?  What the f*ck.  Hurry up and die you f*cking arseholes.  F*cking hurry up.  </p>
