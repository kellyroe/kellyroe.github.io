                                    I was fairly sure that Ashley Bloomfield did a MBChB BEFORE doing a...  What was that?  A 120 point 1 year Honors Programme followed by a 120 point 1 Year Research Masters?  Or was that a 120 point 1 year Honors Programme followed by a 240 point 2 Year Masters?  Maybe a 2 Year Masters comprised of 1 year of course-work followed by a 1 year thesis?  Or maybe that was 120 point 1 year Honors followed by a 120 point 1 year course-work followed by a 240 point 2 year up to 50,000 word only Masters.  Or maybe that was a 10 year Masters?  Or maybe that was a 6 year Medical Degree followed by 2 years as Junior Doctor followed by 1 year of Honors followed by...  Anyway...  Waiting for Ashley's salary reveal, now.

                                    I do not deny that he seemed calm and measured and those kinds or sorts of things that were rightly valued during that time.  Of course, it is easier to come across that way (to be seen to exemplify those characteristics) when one earns half a million dollars per year and when people actually listen to what it is that you have to say.  So you can just speak once.  Instead of having to say the same thing over and over and OVER AND OVER and f*cking well over again AND F*CKING WELL OVER AND OVER AGAIN JAMMING IT UP THEIR F*CKING ASSES.  I think that most people would really appreciate the luxury of not needing to bang on (and on and on and on and f*cking on...).

                                    Regarding competence...  The initial lockdown was not lawful.  But that's okay.  The laws don't seem to matter insofar as certain special snowflakes are concerned.  That's a wonderful message to be sending to the kiddies.  I didn't know that people could or would be appointed Professor (presumably in a non-honorary capacity) without a PhD.  Without extensive publications in the field.  Still...  What 'University', eh?
