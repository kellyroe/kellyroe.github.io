 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->

                            <article>

                                <p>
                                    I was fairly sure that Ashley Bloomfield did a MBChB BEFORE doing a...  What was that?  A 120 point 1 year Honors Programme followed by a 120 point 1 Year Research Masters?  Or was that a 120 point 1 year Honors Programme followed by a 240 point 2 Year Masters?  Maybe a 2 Year Masters comprised of 1 year of course-work followed by a 1 year thesis?  Or maybe that was 120 point 1 year Honors followed by a 120 point 1 year course-work followed by a 240 point 2 year up to 50,000 word only Masters.  Or maybe that was a 10 year Masters?  Or maybe that was a 6 year Medical Degree followed by 2 years as Junior Doctor followed by 1 year of Honors followed by...  Anyway...  Waiting for Ashley's salary reveal, now.  He was picked out all special snowflake like to do Clinical Training to actually see patients in the capacity as Medical Doctor -- right?  He was given one of the limited training places (we don't have any doctors cry cry cry we don't have any doctors who can see patients cry cry cry we don't have enough training places to train any more doctors cry cry cry no training places no doctors to see patients).  He was picked out for a limited entry training place to train to work with patients.  Before being paid off half a million dollars a year NOT to see patients.  Right?  Isn't that the basic idea...
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    I do not deny that he seemed calm and measured and those kinds or sorts of things that were rightly valued during that time.  Of course, it is easier to come across that way (to be seen to exemplify those characteristics) when one earns half a million dollars per year and when people actually listen to what it is that you have to say.  So you can just speak once.  Instead of having to say the same thing over and over and OVER AND OVER and f*cking well over again AND F*CKING WELL OVER AND OVER AGAIN JAMMING IT UP THEIR F*CKING ASSES.  I think that most people would really appreciate the luxury of not needing to bang on (and on and on and on and f*cking on...).
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Regarding competence...  The initial lockdown was not lawful.  But that's okay.  The laws don't seem to matter insofar as certain special snowflakes are concerned.  That's a wonderful message to be sending to the kiddies.  I didn't know that people could or would be appointed Professor (presumably in a non-honorary capacity) without a PhD.  Without extensive publications in the field.  Still...  What 'University', eh?  I mean, as head of an institution he gets to put himself down as first author on anything that comes out of the institution, I suppose.  Anything that is allowed to.  Anything that goes off to external examiners etc etc is pre-screened by Ashley.  Is that the idea/l?  I can see why they would be concerned to have a half a million dollar a year servant censoring the outputs of anything in public or population or policy or whatever it is health.  They really do need to just move it all to Massey.  Train them with the people who look after the meat and milk and racing animals.  The whole mentality around population management and so on.  Making sure the people have their shots (immunisation or euthanasia on schedule). 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                     The whole..  *Adoration* of Ashley...  Didn't anybody think that maybe it was...  Not irony, exactly...  I do wonder what his sons are doing now.  Maybe a special piece on them?  I would imagine that he's paying off Harvard or whomever millions upon millions to babysit his children.  Maybe...  Maybe they have gone off to Epstein Island for a while...  Who knows...  I do feel concerned about his children since they were forced to stay inside his home while he deeclared the whole nation unlawfully to be in lockdown with impunity or immunity.  Best do what Daddy says, eh, now.  Who'se your Daddy?  Wonder who his Daddy was for him to be picked to do MBChB in the first  place.  And why they didn't want him to be GP in the RC (Where Shane Reti was supposed to be -- his internship location...  But he's paid off, now, to not see patients.  Right?)  Ayesha...  She's paid off, now, to not see patients.  Right?
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    I wonder about his student loan.  I guess he chose to 'invest in his education' when he paid how much in fees to study for how many years?  To get to be appointed Professor...  Wow.  Does he have experience tutoring at University?  Does he have experience grading?  Does he have experience teaching?  Does he have experience writing publications for academic journals?  Does he have appointment as Junior Lecturer?  For how many years was he a temporary hire only before he made tenure?  That must have been quite the moment for him.  Tenure.  Achieving that after laboring for so long for academia.  What a nice thing to see all his efforts for academia duly compensated (not financially, of course, some things like tenure or Professorships apparently money can't buy -- they are just given away).  
                                </p>

                                <p>My understanding was that you aren't allowed to supervise a student doing a qualification that is higher level than the one that you have.  But perhaps the new institution is what New Zealand likes to call a 'terminal masters programme' -- right Doctor Ashley?  M.D.  No.  MBChB.  Which was an undergraduate level degree...  Followed by a 120 point or a 240 point Masters or something else?  What a quality hire for the 'University' in everything it is that they value...  Now back to your regularly scheduled programming of the Bloomfield Show (that would be Angela rather than Ashley).  Daugher of the administrator marries the hed of surgery.  The New Zealand dream.  Riiiiiight.  Quality programming right there.  Wah wah wah we don't have any doctors...  Right Doctor Ashley.  MBChB (an undergraduate degree) MA...  No..  Not a Master of Arts.  I don't know what the letters are that goes with Public Health.  'Doctor', apparently.  'Professor' even.  For all the civil servants who graduate from the civil service once they tire of earning half a million per year for their service.
                                </p>

                                <p>I mean, what a big 'F*CK YOU' to people like Angela.  I mean to say the co-ordinator of MEDSCI142.  The University won't even give her a PhD for all the work she has done in Medical Education over the years.  Over how many years?  Get her work to external examiners did they?  How little do they pay her for all the work that she does?  All the people who have labored for the University for how many years...  For how many years...  To have a VC appointed from Nottingham (no ties to New Zealand) and then people like Ashley Bloomfield be appointed PRofessor when he doesn't have background in Academia and he doesn't even have a Phd.  I mean to say he never did the work for one.  Did he?  Or maybe the people missed that.  Maybe he enrolled in the PhD after all?  Or they found one in the trophy room and sent it out with his name on it?</p>

                                <p>So the new academic pathway involves people leaving school and heading to Wellington.  THey can then smooze and smooze and smooze their way into all the civil servant parties and cry cry cry for entry level positions in the civil service.  Maybe live in a contractors basement for a year or two or three..  The 'frictional unemployment' while the jobs are largely handed to the administrators children, anyway.  And then you work your way up the $$$$ tree as a civil servant.  Those are the jobs for life.  They never fire you or remove you from office.  Eh Chris Whelan?  And what are we supposed to believe about Ashley.  Quarter of a million dollar salary per year, now?  Because he's giving up money to be a public servant?  Or is he chasing the money and this opportunity is even more lucrctive for him.  ALllll of the research fudnign for Ashley, I can only suppose.  Anyway..  So that's the career trajectory.  Civil servants work their way up to being appointed Professors of the University.  Wow.  Still.  Hard to explain to the kiddies that the way to get to Harvard is to, apparently, do con-munications at Waikato as an undergrad and then wait for them to send you a letter offering you a PhD.  Work hard in school kiddies.  Yeah, right.  </p>

                                <p>Hey, it's nothing new.  Waikato was only training 8 Clinical Psychologists per year.  Where are they now?  They have lucrative Government jobs NOT TO SEE PATIENTS.  They get those lucrative Government jobs NOT TO SEE PATIENTS because the training programme involves indoctonating them into believing that they only get to make things worse therefore it would be all but unethical for them not to follow the money trail into managment where you manage the funds me-wards and document how 'treatment' only makes people worse therefore do not treat.  Do not employ any clinical workers.  Do not train any clinical workers.  Alllll of the money for me.  Only me.  Only me and my selfishness.  Apoptosis of all the skilled labor and work in New Zealand.  Apoptosis of the University and the Polytech and so on and so forth.  What education and training system?  It's sooooooooo cmopetitive.  Nommy nom nom we loves to eat the babies...</p>

                                <p>In fact, apparently Dawn Freshwater (is that her real name?  That sounds like the kind of name that people voluntarily choose to change their name to) went to University and trained to be a mental health / psychiatric nurse.  But then instead of workign with patients as a mental health or psychiatric nurse (wah wah wah there aren't any we don't have any) they pay her out to  be an administrator.  So...  I guess what I am really wondering..  What matters most-est to me...  Is whether these people who sold out or were brought off or whatever whatever there wsa no alterntive...  They are working in administration not clinical after having taken up an 'it's soooooo competitive' limited entry training place...  Whether they are working to make things better so that other people can actually train in, graduate from, and work in the fields.  Or whether they are doing the whole prevention and prohibition and stabotage thing.  I mean, I don't know if Ashley wanted to be a Doctor and the only way his Daddy would accept him not seeing patients was if he could tell his Daddy there was more money in the Government position to not see patients.  Or if Ashley wanted to be a doctor but was bullied into fleeing the field entirely...  And so what his aim or goal is or whtever about that now.  WHether his aim is to prevent and prohibit others.  Quite what it is that he's sooo butt hurt about.  If he is.  Or quite what is going on or down...  Wrapping up of the University.  The 'University' ahem.</p>

                                <p>All the work that Angela does making sure that nobody is dissecting  rat who isn't supposed to be.  Come on.  CORRUPTION.  Come on...</p>

                                <p>I  mean..  I don't know if Dawn Freshwater was appointed by international community primarily, in response to students claiming that they had been raped in residential halls, detained by Psychiatry in Grafton in a manner or way that involved them breeching their visa conditions, then deported in violtaion of their visa conditions having completion of their qualification/s withheld.  I don't know if she was appointed to put a stop to these practices and actually help improve the quality and integrity of the University, I mean to say.  Or if her hire was simply to provide some false hope to the people delaying the inevitable demise just a little bit while she takes as much money out as she can along the way.  She has knowledge of mental health nursing in the UK, I mean to say.  So she'd likely be in the position to be able to say a few things about the way that the Grafton Psychiatric facility is being run / managed / maintained and about the pipleine from University of Auckland (particularly) to people being detained and deported without their qualifications.  I do hope they are trying to fix things up, genuinely.  Gee.  I wish I could help.  I think that Quigley is a nasty little man in fact.  That is what I think.  I have seen no reason whatsoever to think otherwise.  But, then, the Univesrity of Waikato has next to nothing to do with the Waikato hospital and even the DHB, I suppose, was a southern outpost of Auckland, I guess.  Aiming and aspiring to have all the accreditation taken away...  </p>

                                <p>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/shameful-and-disgusting-university-of-auckland-slammed-for-kicking-out-student-over-mental-health-issues/FDEFC7RIRFMKTB3CJ6E4YLAZDU/  This happened under Stuart McCutcheon (before Dawn Freshwater arrived).  Ashley wants to get involved in this (there are particular problem with the whole 'Public Health' thing since you have studnets who want to do Medicine and the entitled f*cking brats of the admnistration thinking they can do anything anything anything they please with no consequences to themselves in virtue of who their parents are.  Process my application to Medicine.  We don't need to look to 'no speak English' to find another psychiatrist for the PRofessor Glue factory.  F*cking hurry up and process it according to the algorithm you published for the purposes of accountability.  It's not rocket science.  </p>

                                <p>I mean, we saw the Public's reaction or response to Uffindell's underware trophy display when he was an undergraduate at Otago.  Of course the people like to think that the point of Medical Selection would be NOT TO SELECT such grossly unsuitable candidates.  I think the people might be interested to know how many of those kids of kids are deemed 'must have' for things like Medicine and Law.  I mean, they don't complain about the lack of informed consent in Medicine.  They aren't going to tell if unauthorised people are in the OR or are performing a little something something on the down low while a person is heavily sedated.  They aren't going to complain about gropey partner in the office party.  Or about the worse things that happen where it is very strongly implied that if you don't put out (or do anything anything anything on demand) then there never will be a job for you.  Some people will give their eye teeth, apparently.  While some other people..  Want to take them.  Must have.</p>

                                <p>I mean, think about it for 5 minutes.  All the kids being pimped out and abused in state care.  Being presented by Government appointed guardians with bruises and broken teeth and bones.  With sexually transmittted diseases.  Being flaunted before the hospital employees by people on Government payroll to abuse those children.  Now..  Does the Government want to employ people in the hospital who will raise the issue with people higher up..  Or does the Government want to employ people in the hospital who will keep their yap shut?  Now, who is a better bet to keep their yap shut?  Someone who jumps in for a little something something for themselves while the opportunity presents to them?  Or something else?  You think about it.  Do the math (so to speak).  Must have.</p>

                                <p>All the energy and effort and actual *work* involved in whipping people to hurry the f*ck up in the race to the bottom.  To get in behind the likes of Dawkins selfish selfish.  His seifish genes.  Telling us the meaning of life.  The meaning of life for old women (who won't sleep with you)  is actually to look after your babies.  Didn't you know.  Old women are only there to be grandmother to other people's selfish genes.  Selfish selfish selfish.  The most selfish wins what is most important in life.  I suppose.  The whole narcissisis in love with his reflection thing.  Fell into the water and was one with the happiest moment of his life.  Shame about him dragging everybody else in with him.  Aye.</p>

                                <p>Eye surgery...   https://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/130418170/eye-surgeon-ian-dallison-pleads-guilty-to-attempted-murder  Mmmmm.  Wouldn't you do anything anything anything anything for him?  Anything anything anything anything to be hand picked chosen as special, by him, to be the next eye surgeon?  Anything anything anything for a reference from him?  Anything anything anything for his recommendation?  New Zealand doesnt' have surgeons because of...  DUUUUH...  UUUUUUH...  AWEKTKDHGKDRKL no spikkity da engleeeeeeesh.</p>

                                <p>P.S., my whole thing about 'no spikkity da English' is because...  I know that this is the speel that they say to international students.  That their grades (for example) don't matter.  Because their english is (allegedly) not good enough.  That's the reason why.  THe reason why they weren't selected.  Why they weren't hand picked chosen as special.  And the reason why I focus on this, in particular...  Is because the people who they hand pick choose in fact (despite their selection algorithm and not at all because of it)...  They are only so willing to say they 'no speak english' when it comes to them being held accountable for their actions or decisions.  I mean to say they intentionally seem to hand pick choose psychopaths or deviants who claim to be 'no spikkity da engleeeeesh' when it comes to accountability for their oversights or crimes.  Two faced ness.  That's what I mean to say.  Lacking in the honesty.  Lacking in the integrity.  It wouldn't matter so much...  But this is healthcare.  Public healthcare.  For teh people.  The workers of the economy (trying if only the govt would stop with teh stabotage)...  Etc...  Waikato...  The dairy farming contributors to the economy.  You are welcome (atrocies, atrocies, atrocities all round).  Why doesn't Shane Reti see patients?  Wasn't his Daddy all gunning for him (supposedly) to attend the University of Waikato...  Therefore he's apparently hand-picked for Medicine with Auckland (after first year at Auckland?) and then expediated (choppers!) to Harvard to learn about helecopter medicine..... To witness the lack of healthcare up north... To feel disempowered...  To enter into policits to make meaningful change, therefore..   Meaningful change being to have the peopel of his electorate accept the lack of healthcare for them...  Alllll the money for Shane Reti!!!!!!!!! Allllllll of the money for him!!!!!!  Sigh.  That would be racist.  Why pick out the low hanging fruit...  He's Maaori though no fault of his own.  As is Winston Peters.  Why hold them to that?  I call not fair.  Not fair.  True story.  Hold them to the same standards as everyone else...  But it is unfair to pick or single them out...  Because they are (though no fault of their own) the low hnging fruit.  They are clearly brilliant or genius in fact at everything it is that the white person values...  That's why they were hand picked...  I don't envy them in fact...</p>

                                <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/300766750/the-number-of-kids-being-taken-from-their-parents-has-plummeted-history-tells-us-the-pendulum-could-swing-back  Why was his Mother in prison?  I ask because I wonder if she was sent there because people had sights on her son.</p>

                                <p>I'm sorry...  It should have been obvious to me...  The very very very very first thing that Ashley is going to do in his appointment as Professor is...  Strike for better pay.  LMFAO</p>

                                <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/481090/volunteer-devotes-more-than-40-years-fighting-for-justice-for-lake-alice-victims  Wow... He labored and labored and labored for his slave pay.  Right????  I'm sorry...  Allllllllllllll of the titles and honors and awards and money and women and access to the children for Ashley!!!  All heil almighty God of Ashley!!!!!!  Aren't you SOOOOOOO GLAAAAAD that Ashley was specially handpicked as chosen to be the one and only one who was allowed to work with clinical patients (who will never be allowed to work with clinical patients) there must never be enough to go around it's soooooooooo competitive!!!! People must be forced to give their eye teeth (at least) to be hand picked specially chosen for...   Half a million dollars per year for...  Half a million dollars per year for...  Half a million dollars per year.  So...  When peopel tatoo your face upon them do you think it is so they will never forget to sing your praises...  Or so...  They will never forget to..  Uh.. Something else.  Shall we say...  Uh... Something else.   ffs.  It processes the application according to the published algorthim for f*cking well processing them.  Duuuuuh.  Maybe in 20 generations of improvment on the current gene pool it might.  I mean..  FFs.  Seriously></p>

                                <p>not sit well with him as many hospitals were short-staffed today.

"But they don't go abusing their patients like they did at Lake Alice."  LOL.  Why would you think that?  I mean, seriously.  They delay delay delay and obstruct and deny...  They genuinely seem to think that if they can delay for long enough they will have created a 'new normal'.  That is or means to say...  Well..  By delying me justice they have asserted the right for Universities New Zealnd to record students enrolment also failure in courses the studnet never applied to be enrolled in.  While also refusing to get work studnets have done to external examiners to prevent and prohibit interntional community from saying the studnet has done enough for a graduate research qualification.  They think they get to pick and choose whomever they want for whatever arbitary reasons they want.  Look at the arbitrary reasons that they want:  Dr Leeks.  Enough said.</p>

<p>Why would anybody think that Dr Leeks is dead?  I think it most likely that he is having a party party party with Epstein.  Revelling in their sexual abuses of children.  Because it makes them feel particularly big about themselves.  Wouldnl't you say?  What reason would anybody have to believe the contrary?  Open casket funerals?  Independent DNA testing of the corpses? Dental records?  What a f*cking joke...  </p>

<p>Well then, bonus!  Once they've been incapacitated with the 'dyslexic' label they can then be incpacitated with the 'illerate' and / or 'innumerate' label.  Their anxiety is a good sign that they understand their position in life (that dyslexia is good or reasonable grounds for pronouncing illiteracy and innumeracy) oh..  And also anxiety as well.  So, to be clear... The reason why you don't make living wage.  The reason why your work isn't given to external examiners.  The reason why you don't get qualifications youve completed the requirements of... Is because... You were proclaimed and pronounced to be incapacitated so!!! Boo yah!!! Ashley...  Capable of following the laws?  Not so much.  Well then.  He will have the very very very very best stories to tell the children.  I'm sure.  Let's all protest because Ashlely needs a payrise!!! Alllllllll of the payrise for Ashley!!!!! I mean, I'm sure nobody has invested more in a NZ Tertiary Education than him (in both time and money).  I bet he's got a hell of a mortgage to pay off.  Squillions of slaves etc.
