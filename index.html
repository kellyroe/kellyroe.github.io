                                <p>In a competitive environment where the aim is to maim, weaken, sicken, incapacitate, disable.  To confuse, obscure, prevent, prohibit, obstruct, delay.  No sense can be made of medical treatment or of healthcare.  Any of the social services.  Education.  Justice.  New Zealand is not rule by law.  New Zealand is not part of the free world.  The website is here so people can see what is happening with the courts.  We don't have Universities because they are slavers.  They teach compliance with government directive.  Titles are honorary only and they are more interested in social media follows than academic values which they don't appear to even comprehend.  There is no freedom of speech here.  There is no academic dialogue or debate.  This nation is not rule by law and is not part of the free world, at all.  We are not really processing visas anymore.  We have very high rates of child abuse - by design.  We are the exclusion zone when it comes to modern advances in technology and culture and everything in-between.  We just wait for the elders to die so that the rest of us might live.  Waiting for them to die.  So that some other people can have jobs, too.  It's sooooooo competitive.  What goes in to keeping people in states such that they will do anything anything anything at all outside a nightclub on a Friday night for $25 (John Key's grand plan on how to vaccinate the people). </p>
