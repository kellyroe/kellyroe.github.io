                            <article>

                                <p>
                                    https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2022/12/teen-reveals-frantic-fight-for-mental-health-help.html
                                </p>

                                <p>So many stories like this.  So many stories like this.  You got told that you could have treatment if you could pay for it privately.  But I suspect that's a lie.  Some people get told that they could have treatment if they got a court order for it.  But that turned out to be a lie.  Some people get told that they could have treatment if they were imprisoned.  But that turned out to be a lie.  Some people were told that they could get the treatment in hospital.  If they got sick or bad enough to be hospitalised.  But that was a waiting game.  Waiting for a bed to become available so the hospital could collect up more and more and more money for keeping you detained.  Some people in hospital are told that they need to be out of hospital before they will get treatment.  People are told they are too sick for treatment.  There isn't any psychotherpy for people with severe schizophrenia or psychosis or personality disorders.  They are too sick for treatment.  Others are told that they aren't sick enough for treatment.  They would have to have severe schizophrenia or psychosis or personality disorder in order to qualify for any treatment at all.  It's just an endless succession of bullshit lies and made up excuses.
                                </p>

                                <p>We do know that early intervention is more humane.  We don't need several generations of observational study observing the f*cking obvious of the social consequences and the humanitarian consequences and so on and so forth for bullying people.  Basically.  THat's what it is.  Right?  When the health system says 'you consented to your information being made available but we refuse because that's what we do.  We find out what you want and what you need and we make sure that things go down differently'.  If you didn't consent to information sharing (e.g., because you were afraid of an abusive person finding out that you were talking about them having abused you and retaliating) then they would yappity yap yap yap yap it all over the place.  Bring in the person for a little 1:1 conversation, even, to tell them that you had made accusations.  So they could really get to work ensuring that you keep your yap shut.</p>

                                <p>You mean to say the entire system is itself abusive?  Well...  At what point do you sort of go...  This endless succession of crap about how 'we can't' and 'it's too hard' and this ineptitude and incompetence...  At what point do you start facing up to malevolent intent?</p>

                                <p>Different people need / want different kinds of support in therapy.  That's how come there are so very many different kinds or types or styles of therapy.  THey are often based on one 'great person' in a sense, where one individual who people found particularly helpful tries to talk about the conception that they have of people and how to help people, or whatever.  Many different styles of types of therapy.  From Freudian Psychoanalysis (Classical Psychoanalysis) to different schools of psychoanalysis that arose after the death of Freud.  To psychodynamically oriented.  To narrative.  To cognitive.  To behavioral.  To cognitive-behavioral.  So many different types of therapy or councelling or psychoanalysis.  </p>

                                <p>Not for us here in New Zealand.  Of course.  The Public service..  Not sure how counselling is regulated in New Zealand (who is allowed to get ACC funding for that).  What their curriculum is.  I remember a 2 year Masters (2 years of course-work, I believe, though maybe an internship?) at Univesrity of Waikato was quite a popular post-graduate study programme for people who realised they did not want to do cognitive behavior therapy which was the only game in town for clinical psychology (Otago or Waikato).  Only I am sure they would not put it that way.  The way they would put it is that it is soooooooooooo competitive.  Everybody who takes psychology (it used to be around 2x250 in the first year cohort) wanted to become a clinical psychologist to administer psychological tests to dx psychological / psychiatric / substance abuse disorders and get governmetn money for treating people in the public service.  Cognitive behavior therapy being the only game in town for clinical psychology in New Zealand.</p>

                                <p>Many people found that they did not like cognitive behavior therapy because it was punitive.  Focused on changing people's faulty beliefs.  They had to have faulty beliefs, you see, that was a foundational premise of the treatment.  You start by getting out of the person a list of their distored beliefs.  If they didn't give you a list of distorted beliefs they were resisting treatment or some such nonsense.  IMHO.  To each their own..</p>

                                <p>To each their own...  Wouldn't it be great if there was a list of therapists with a bit of a blurb about what kind of therapy they offer and peopel could pick who they wanted to see.  What's that?  Choice in our heatlh system?  My way or the highway.  Take what you are offered (an offer you can't refuse is how it seems to go they will court order you against your will if you don't voluntarily choose what they have chosen for you) and you are supposed to go 'we don't know how lucky we are!' (indeed we would have suicided years ago if only we knew).</p>

                                <p>Different people find different styles or types of treatment to be useful or theraputic for them.  Supposing the aim is to help, of course.  But why would that be the case? Why not use counselling (along with all the other things) as a punative mechanism that the governmetn can use to control the people and have them kicked back and down so that more and more and more money etc can go to the elite few who would never say publically that they wanted councelling because that is a public admission of weakness that means you are now a target and you lose.  THe great hierarchy of most fit.  You are supposed to pomp and strut and show off how you win the hierarchy of life.  See?  Act your way into feeling different.</p>

                                <p>The talking about a toy thing can be a useful way for some people to say things they would find difficult otherwise.  But it isn't a technique for everyone.  Sure.  But nonononono everyone must be all the same.  And if it works for one it must be forced on all.  Sigh.  </p>

                                <p>What was the fate of the 8 clinical psychologists that Waikato trained every year?  I think they were trained (post-graduation) to write up how them treating patients made the patients worse.  Therefore they recommend no psychotherapy for the patient.  And they can write that up about every patient, you see.  So they only need have a few psychologists in staff because it turns out that people are just lying to themselves and also lying to the government when they say they need psychotherapy.  Because the only treatment the governemnt will pay for is one intentionally designed to make people soooooo bad that they are decomissioned entirely.  Incapacitated.  Aw.  You lose the great game of life.  That's the goal the aim the purpose the point.  That's how they get to pat themselves on the back for the wonderful job they do?  Right?</p>

                                <p>Do you think they can process applications to enrol?  The University of Waikato?  I don't know that they can...  They train half the countries Clinical Psychologists (the ones who work for the former DHB's).  The 2 year Master of Councelling (post-graduate qualification).  But they can't process enrolments or completions...  So...  There isnt' any shortage of people wanting to be psychotherapists.  Quite a few people would have really benefited from it when they were younger.  Those people don't get the help they needed.  They grow up..  THey sort things out themselves.  The hard way.  They genuinely want to help things be easier for the next generation.  But the government won't allow it.  The aim the goal the purpose or the point is not to make things easier for the next generaetion.  You see?  The aim the goal or the purpose or point is to work only to undermine and stabotage and make things more difficult for the next generaetion.  All the things that harmed you...  You get to use those tools.  That knowledge that you learned.  To gaslight and undermine and disenfranchise and so on.  It's sooooooo competitive, you see.  Sooooooo competitive.  You want the people to cry cry cry cry cry cry cry to the governemnt about how they don't have the psychotherapy services that they need so you collect up more and more and more and more money for being the only psychotherapist in town.  THen it's 'my way or the highway'.  Sure.</p>

                                <p>I just got "A clockwork Organge" because I only saw it once.  Years ago.  Gosh the doctor looks uncannily like Dr Leeks.  Wouldn't you say?  Of course Dr Leeks likely didn't pick his face.  But maybe his face picked his being picked to be psychiatrist in New Zealand.  I mean to say...  The aim wasn't to take 'bad' people and shock them into being good.  The aim was to take good people and shock them into being bad.  So that bad people could feel good making good people feel bad.  Dr Leeks.  The only game in town.  The only one they put on payroll.  Where did he train?  Who signed off on his registration?  How many interns did he train, in turn?  HOw many people did he fast track to registration?  How many people's applications to be psychiatrists did he throw away?  HOw many people that he hand-picked are doing the hand-picking today?
                                </p>


                                <p>Process my application...  Process my application.  Process my application.  F*cking hurry up.  Yet another year of wrongly decided.  Hand-picked for all the qualities they value.  Hurry the f*ck up.</p>

                                <p>They need to develop some kind of 'Miranda Warning' equivalent for therapists.  'Anything that you say may be used against you' and so on.  That's why the government keeps (non-secure) records on the people -- right?  So that it can write falsehoods for the purposes of declaring people losers in the great life-game hierarchy of  being?  Where did Ashley go with his millions of taxpayers dollars, again?  Why isn't anybody worried or concerned about the mental health of a person who voluntarily chooses to step down from or give up half a million dollar a year job with a daily tv show timeslot?  I mean who in their right mind?  All voluntary, was it?  All voluntary-like?  Was he volunteered, was he?  What proper process?  What developed nation?</p>
