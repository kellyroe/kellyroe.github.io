                            <p>
                                <a href="https://kellyroe.github.io/writing/realmecv.pdf">Chronological CV</a>
                                There is a link to my CV that I have presently under consideration for various things.
                             </p>

                             <p>When you look at how they won't graduate people you need to look at what the Dean of Research at Waikato referred to as 'exit qualifications'.  I mean to say they don't have any problems with graduation ceremonies or events for people who have already been enrolled in further study with the 'university'.  So, they will have graduation events for people at the end of the third year of a 3 year 'degree'.  Only if they are enrolled in their honors year.  Then they will have graduation events for people at the end of their fourth or honors year (to really boost the numbers in gowns) only if they are already enrolled in a masters or doctoral or further certificates.  It's only the 'exit qualifications' that they won't do.  It's time to die, you see, when you won't get any more money for keeping them re re re re re enroled, more and more money from the government to keep the students on less than minimum wage, and then it's time for them to die, you see.  Bully to death.  They were supposed to have more and more and more and more babies, everyone, we need a new class of 3,000  ++++++ medical students to meet the universities demand to be funded for more and more and more and more medical studnets so that we can end up with zero medical graduates.  Year after year after year after year.  Bully each other to death, they do, it's sooooo competitive.  Then it's super easy to pick the weakened off, at the end, there.  They don't come back from their internships.  THey took jobs overseas.  Their social media postings always were indistinguishable from a computer programme and nothing has changed.  What medical doctors?  What lawyers, eh, Judith?  You going to do pro bono work, now, with the CAB etc talking to the migrant workers processing their claims of asylum etc?  Yeah, right.</p>

                             <p>Judith Collins make Queens Counsel?  Is that for all the work that she's done, over however many years, serving as a public prosecutor?  Must be.  Like how Shane Reti is registered to practice as a GP for all the work he does, in that capacity 1, or is that 3 weeks of every year.  He manages to see all the clients enrolled with him as their PHO in the 1-3 weeks.  Manages to write them an entire year's worth of opiate and amphetamine and anasthetics prescriptions.  An entire year's worth of referrals to specialists.  I'm sure.  Of course.  He's such a superman.  And Judith Collins is exactly what one would expect of a lawyer.  The professionalism, I mean to say, with the leaked information about individuals medical information.  She's exemplary.  I suppose nobody else applied for enrolment in Law, nobody else graduated.  Nobody else is registered to practice.  Nobody else is employed by the government to prosecute the governments crimes.  It's the University of Government, didn't you know? When the highest degrees and titles and honors and awards are handed out on an honorary basis with..  Are they imaginary pay-cheques then?  Apparently grades don't mean everything.  They don't mean anything at all when they are handed out to people who did not even do any of the work for them.  NZ doesn't have any professionals because they don't have an education system.  Justice Toogood proclaimed that it's slave prison detention camps.  People are being enrolled in 'tertiary' courses that they never applied to be enrolled in.  THey aren't getting the work out to be externally examined, at all.  There's nothing there.  There aren't any universities.  They don't want people reading (how the government refuses to follow the laws and the judiciary refuses to uphold them).  They don't want people viewing how the government pretends to keep accounts.  THey won't pay the workers.  It's really not rocket science.  Of course there isn't any rocket science in NZ.  There's nothing in NZ.  Taken over by psychopaths and there's nothing there.  Death camps.  There's nothing there. </p>

                             <p>I will try not to do  anything to break the links while I refresh the contents.  I am in the process of file re-formatting and reorganising my work. </p>

                             <p>I am not entirely sure what to do about revisions.  On the one hand it is tempting for me to do them.  On the other hand, nobody is paying me to do them.  How much is enough for a PhD?  For paid employment?  I guess you start by taking a careful look at the various people who, allegedly, or apparently, have PhD's and have paid employment.  See how much they did.  Maybe see how much they continue to do, post-graduation.  Have a think about their oral defences, as well.  Whether people can ask questions freely of them or whether they huddle in with a herd and don't even attend other people's talks at conference etc.  Hiding in their hotel rooms still writing their talks.  Off on sight-seeing events instead of attending other people's talks.  Fielding questions so that only 'in-group' can ask questions at their 'friends' talks.  Preventing people from asking questions of people who..  Most likely weren't even the author of the stuff they are presenting.  What a f*cking joke of a farce of a scummy scam.  What conferences?  </p>

                             <p>Who pays for the 'visitor season' at Canberra?  Do the ARC grants specify the amounts that will be given to (often tenured professors) in the USA to travel to Austrlia for a time and...  What?  Take work from students enrolled in Australia to take back with them to the northern hemisphere and pass off as their own?  Is that the grand plan?  Who pays for the visitor season?  Do they self fund?  Tourism?  THey come to Australia and do a little anything anything anything everything that certain individuals say, the real `rock stars' because they are under the impression that that's what it takes for the possibility of, what?  A 1 year post-doc for people already with tenured positions in the States?  No shortage of people around for scheduled oral defences, then.  Was there a single oral defence that was scheduled?  I don't remember seeing anybody with a publically advertised oral defence that was scheduled.  What University?  THere's nothing there.  </p>

                             Not sure what date to put on that.  2010?  2011?  2012?  The Australian National University has inserted the table of content into my student record notes as evidence they were supplied with the document that is of sufficient length for doctoral examination during a time in which I was enrolled as a doctoral candidate.  Maybe ask them when they intend to schedule the public oral defence?  Get them to pass the external examiners comments along to me so I can prepare for the oral defense?  Looking forward to it!  When do you think it might be?  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                               Does anybody enrolled in the ANU get reports from external examiners and hold a public defence?  Ever?  Any of them?  Any of them at all?  Any of them who are presently employed either at the ANU, or elsewhere in Australia?  Any of them who got paid employment overseas and visas, apparently dependent on their status as doctoral graduates?  (1)  How many years after their enrolment start date were they kept enrolled before their work went out for external exam?  (2)  How many years later did they get reports from examiners (did they get any)?  (3)  Where and when was their public oral defence scheduled?  (4)  Any atendees for that?  Is it a university -- or a prison, slave, or detention camp?  What Universities?
                         </p>

                                <p><a href="./publish/2013-rep.pdf">Roe, (2013).  A few small chunks for 2013.</a>
                                </p>

                                <p>Sterelny referred to the above as a `few small chunks' so I'm taking him to be authorative on that.  Maybe he was only focussed on the parts that referenced himself.</p>

                                 <p><a href="./publish/2018-rep-1.pdf">Roe, (2018).  Disability and equity for medicine and public health (September, 2018)</a>
                                </p>

                                <p>This was a 120 point 1 EFT 34 week (including the external examination process MPhil).  3 spiral bound copies were supplied to the Research School on 14 September 2018 and they still haven't send it out for external examination.</p>

                                  <p><a href="./publish/2018-rep-2.pdf">Roe, (2018).  Disability and equity for medicine and public health (October, 2018)</a>
                                </p>

                                <p>The University sent the MPhil out requesting `doctoral reports' from externals.  I don't know if externals were paid the amount associated with Masters or Doctoral examination but they were supplied with templates for doctoral examination only.</p>

                                <p><a href="./publish/2019-rep-1.pdf">Roe, (2019).  Disability and equity for medicine and public health (February, 2019)</a>
                                </p>

                                <p>This was the thesis I substantively updated in response to the `doctoral reports' of external examiners of my MPhil.  While they provided enough comments to turn the under 50,000 word 1 EFT MPhil into a 360 point 100,000 word PhD - that wasn't the programme that I applied to be enrolled in.  I even wrote a commentary for the examiners (the Dean said it would make it more likely to be accepted) - and the Dean refused to get the thesis and refused to get the comments to externals. </p>

                                <p>University of Auckland said that I wasn't eligible to start MBChB with Auckland in 2019 because I hadn't completed a qualification from a NZ University within the last 5 years.  That is not what the Education and Training Act says.  The law says I'm eligible because I'm a domestic adult who has attained the age of 20 years.  The above link was a 120 point 1 EFT MPhil completed in the 34 weeks that the TEC says is the normal amount of time to be associated with that qualification.  NZ is not even trying to keep Universities.  We see the lengths they go to to refuse to enrol eligible candidates into their Medical School.  Sorry, their prison slave detention camp.  Where Medical studnets go to die.  Nobody actually graduates from that programme of study.  Right?  Where do the medical graduates go?  They go off in Australian submarines never to be heard from again?  Where are all the doctors?  What Universities?  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p><a href="./publish/2018-rep-2.pdf">Roe, (2019).  Disability and equity for medicine and public health (June, 2019)</a>
                                </p>

                                <p>I get a letter that is pretty obviously extortion.  Saying I am to be kept re-enrolled for 20 points (that more money will be invoiced to my student loan for re-enrolment) and then I am to be detained indefinately under the zero fee scheme (which is for first year studnets and not graduates).  You can follow the legal action over on the tab for that.  NZ is not even trying to be rule by law.  Justice Toogood was reappointend from retirement.  He is past the compulsory age of retirement for judges.  That means to say that after 45 +++ years of government payroll he's still not financially independent from all the government handouts.  We don't have any new judges to appoint, one can only suppose, because nobody graduates from law school.  What Universities?  There is nothing there.</p>

                                <p>The judges refuse to process the cases that were filed.  The change the issue from the one that was filed into something to delay delay delay confuse obstruct prohibit prevent deny.  They refuse to accept evidence presented to them.  THey make false assertions in their judgements.  They ignore half the laws.  There is nothing there.  Not a developed country, at all.  I really don't see that Australia is even trying to be any different.</p>

                                <p>I wrote to the ANU and they said they would not do anything unless I lodged a formal complaint via formal process.  I said I would prefer to sort things out informally and they declined.  I said I wanted to lodge a formal complaint, then.  They then refuse to acknowledge that anything I supply to them is in fact a formal complaint.  There is nothing there.  They don't have a University.  There is nothing there.</p>

                                <p>The manufacture of disease.  Animal cells don't really grow in dishes.  So they try and cause cancers with radiation and so on, trying to get the cells to grow so they can grow them in dishes.  But they don't grow very well in dishes.  So you get samples from cells and tumors etc etc and do your best to get them to grow in dishes.  Then you implant them into whoever you can find and see what you get growing.  Like the tobacco mosaic virus.  Collect it from a plant, grow it in the lab, then put it into another plant and see the new plant get the same sickness.  The manufacture of sickness.  How many people can we kill today?  It's soooooo hostile and it's sooooo competitive!  Nobody need apply!  It's soooo hostile and it's soooo competitive they get thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of medical student every year it's so competitive!  Oh my!  And they die before they'll be graduated.  I'm sure.  So the daughter of the Vice Chancellor can get busy busy busy seeing how many aboriginals she can kill today.  Or similar.  What a f*cking farce of a hoax of a joke of a f*cking scummy scam.  Where is my PhD ffs?  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                                <p>All the work that goes into the prevention and prohibition of social development.  All the work that goes into the provention and prohibition of and underminding of the education and health and so on sectors and systems.  All the work that goes into keeping people in hostile and competitive conditions of torture where it can be (in some sense) reasonably believed that they are all volunteering to kill themselves all voluntary-like!  Just choosing to apoptose themselves all voluntarily -- right  about when it's time for them to be paid!  Oh my!  Nobody would have seen it coming!  How people would rather die than take up fair wages!  Off to the death camps so the over 65's can keep on taking their payroll becuase the over 65's who have had more than 45 years of government payroll for themselves already still arent' financially independent from the government.  45+ years of having government payroll for themselves and they still can't live a life of independence.  Go start themselves a start-up, or something, in the private sector.  Can't do it.  Won't do it.  The f*cking death camps.  There's nothing there.  QUite by design.  The f*ckign psychopaths.</p>

                                <p>Where is the research output of your 'university'?  The variosu people who you claim to be university academics -- with no research output.  What a f*cking joke.  Then the research output that there is.  The conditions that you force upon the controlled populations.  Wanting to measure how sick and diseaed and how much suffering there is that is observed on variosu popluations.  The F*cking psychopaths.  Not even trying to be fair.  Not even trying to do things better.  What Universities?  There's nothing there.  Prison slave detention camps run by f*cking psychos.  Right Sterelny?  WOuldn't have things any other way.</p>

                                <p>Of course that's an interesting thing to have the people believe.  Right?  Then we can put the studnets to 'work' (so to speak) euthanising the elderly (all voluntary-like, they have been volunteered).  That's what it meeeeans to be a medical student.  Isn't it?  You've all agreed to be models for each other by being present in the class.  Break into small groups, everybody, practice on each other.</p>

                                <p>Let's start by filming every inch of skin in the name of searching for skin cancer.  We will need to keep filming on a regular basis to look for emergent cancers.  We will also need to train you in oral cavity searches.  Checking for drugs or for cancers.  Cervical exams.  Prostate exams.  Checking for bowel cancers.  Do you think if you push the scope far enough up you can see the ovaries?  Maybe check out the inside of the abdominal cavity!  Do you think you can go all the way up the intestines to the stomach?  Have a go?  Capstone project can be labotomy!  Fix your nasal polyps.  If you have any approxmination of nasal polyp to be fixed when it's about time to graduate you from the programme...  What medical training system?  What medical graduates do you see?  What doctors in teh hospitals?  There's nothing there.  Hey.  Quite by design.  It's soooooo competitive.  Oh my!  It's sooooooo competitive!  It's sooooooo hostile!  Oh my!!!</p>

                                <p>Well, what are we supposed to think?  What is most reasonable to believe?  Oh, I must be mentally ill! Of course!  That must be why the daughter of the VC must be expedited into position -- because anybody ranked more highly than her on the objective selection criterion must be mentally ill!  Off to the prison camps for them, then!  So that she can take up the position that she's entitled to and she can be empowered to go on to keep the controlled populations.  Keep those cancers rolling in from the patients (see what you can find) to the labs so the labs can see what they can grow in the patients.  Of course.  Everything it is that we value.  Feelign like winners in a hostile and competitive world.  Of course.  The variosu people who are only there becuase they cheated their way in, cheated their way through.  That's the only people who are left.  So when we chop them into pieces and feed them to each other it's the only sense or kind of justice we understand.  Or similar.  Kuru.  Gone quite kuru.  Hey.  There's nothign there.  Quite by design.  Quickly quickly quickly!  Expedite the children of the leaders into their positions quickly quickly quickly.  Everybody else's applications were thrown away!  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>Not even trying to be fair, at all.  There's nothing there.  They know they are only in the positions they are in becuase they lied and they cheated.  They never would have been appointed any other way.  They would have things no other way.  That is the only way that they got to be there.  Do I want to join them?  There is nothing there.  What's to want to be a part of?  There isn't anything there.  THey aren't even trying to be fair.  They aren't even trying to leave the world better than they found it.  They say it's all for the kids and giving their kids in particular a better life -- but that's not even true.  They will happily eat their kids if they get that opportunity, too, that's why they had them, after all.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                                <p>You think the VC lied and cheated and so on to get his daughter a place in Medicine?  I don't think that's the way the selfish psychopathic minds think, actually.  Somehow or other he would have thought that getting her a place in medicine would have protected his own salary.  That would have been all.  Like how the guy they wanted to say won the nobel prize, or similar, for how many cervical cancers he caused had however many sons to do the collecting and growing and implanting and harvesting.  And so on.  Everything it ist hat we value.  The untimely deaths of the people when it's time for them to be paid.  Quickly qiuckly quiclky.  How many peopel did you kill today?  It's sooooo hostile and it's soooo competitive!  Nothing else makes any sense.  Gone all kuru.  Where are the doctors at their graduation?  Where are the publically held oral defences?  Gone all kuru, hey.  Nothing there.  Where did all the people go?  Oh, they were murdered off, many years ago.  This is all that remains.  Dr Leeks and Professor Glue.  Dr Reti and Kings Counsellor Judith Collins.  Rt Honorable Doctor Jacinda Ardern PhD and Professor Ashley Bloomfield (I think the later is maybe contemplating developing a research output or similar, maybe the approximation of the appearance of some kind of work that he did to earn a PhD or MD) and Jacinda is thinking about writing a book one day.  A million dollar book.  To be completed some time in the next...  Several decades, was that?  What education adn training system?</p>

                                <p>

                                </p>

                                <p>There aren't any doctors in America!  Check that out.  Bounties on their heads.  The Federal Government is incentivised to kill them before they come of age.  So they never have to pay them.  Right?  There is some story the Government education system tells them about how property is transferred via maternal lineage (the eldest girl) which puts, then, a bounty on their head.  Kill the eldest girl or make her vanish so the property goes to a younger sister.  That's a convenient narrative to blame the natives.  For selling their loved ones (the girls) to cyotes in return for more power for themselves.  And so on.  But seriously.  Check that out.  There aren't any doctors graduating from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill!  With their specialisation in public health cancer care etc.  None of them.  The 'hospital' is empty.  No gradutes from the 'University'.  </p>

                                <p>Where do they go, then?  The medical graduates of the Univesrity of North Carolina?  The Medical Graduates of AMerica?  Where do they go?  To New Zealand?  Really?  Like that lady who was supposed to go to Invercargil and make youtube videos about birth control for pre-teens, or similar.  So their parents or the government appointed guardians could conceal their crimes for a little longer.  Set up their reputation as volunteers.  Film the women giving birht or similar.  Film the medical studnets performing cervical exams, we could call them.  Film the premature removals?  Nobody was ever prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus, in NZ.  IMplanting whatever you like and harvesting the incubator baby.  Get to work making real angel-man babies who will gigle and approve of anything anything anything you do to them.  Treat them however you like.  It's hard to underestimate the motivations of those who will do anything anything anything anything anything...</p>

                                <p>Where do they go, then, the Medical Graduates of North Carolina?  Maybe they do all turn up to the 'hospital' at the start of week one - never to leave end of week two.  Maybe the hospitals themselves are the gas chambers.  THe death camps.  When it's time to pay the studnets for their exit qualifications.  It's time to go, then.  To be replaced by new studnet slaves who will pay and pay and pay and pay and pay to do anything anything anything anything...  To be replaced by new student slaves who will do...</p>

                                <p>What are we supposed to believe?  What is most reasonable to believe?  Judith Collins is a KC and Shane Reti is a GP?  Ashley Bloomfield is a Professor and Jacinda Ardern was given 3 fellowships to Harvard (after applying for none) becuase she wants to write a book one day.  Have I done enoguh for a PhD?  Have I done enough for entry to MBChB?  Have I done enough for a paycheque?  To work in one of the fine government institutions?  Look at all the people they want to say have done enoguh and what it is that htey have done.  All the people they choose to keep on their payroll.  What a f*cking farce of a joke of a hoax of a scummy scummy scam.</p>

                                <p>Apparently I'm supposed to be working hard to build bridges to them.  Why?  It's so competitive and so hostile what have other people done for me?  Helped me or only worked to eliminate me becaus ethey saw me as a rival or competitor and they thought there wasnt' enoguh in the world for the both of us else they only wanted me in the world in a position of subordination to them.  Even when what I wanted posed no threat to them what they wanted was for me to be subordinate to them.  I'd have to be insane to build bridges to people who are only interested in stabotaging me.  What's that, Sterelny?  Oh, it's all so hostile and so competitive.  The point and purpose of emotions is to be machiavellian about it all.  Bully and abuse.  Guilt and shame.  Control to get people to do anything anything anything anything you want them to do.  Of course.  The controlled populations.  Don't you want to join them?  No.  I'm not a psychopath.  Oh.  SO then off to the gas chamber for me.  We've been taken over by psychopaths, you see.  They would have things no other way.  It's a competitive hierarchy and there is no other way they will allow the world to be.  They aren't he exception they are the norm.  Who wants to be a winner at life?  He who is responsible for annihiliation of everything first wins.  That's the point, right.  We know that there aren't weapons of mass destruction -- because there isn't mass destruction . There is no way that anybody would choose to stockpile a thing like that.  There is no will to live.  Only a will to annihilate everything.  The purpose or fucntion of guilt and shame.  The terrorist bombing leaders.  Weather bomb!  Urgency emergency none of the regular rules apply!  Law doesn't make any sense when you are annihilating the civilians!  There's nothing there.</p>
