                                <p>When I get some time I will try and make light and dark themes my first Javascript project.  I think people have strong preferences either way on the color scheme thing, and I was looking for My First Javascript Project.  So, that might be a nice one.</p>

                                <p> Thanks for bearing with me while I am working through readability issues and figuring out color options. </p>
           
                                <p>You can contact me via the email address: email@kellyroe.org.
                                Yes, you probably read that correctly, 
                                my email address starts with the word "email".
                                I'll let you copy-paste that into whatever email programme you like.

                            <h2>Court Process</h2>

                               <div class=container>

                            <p>Where things are up to with the courts.  I am trying to have the substantive judgments of the High Court heard in the Court of Appeal.  I think that if you read many of the High Court Judgments that come out of the High Court of NZ you will get the sense or the feeling that things read strangely and justice has not been done, yet.  At least, that is how I feel when I read High Court Judgments about cases where I don't know anything more than what is actually present or contained within that High Court Judgment.</p>

                            <p>
                            When I read the Judgments of the Court of Appeal they often read considerably better.  They sound fairer, if that makes sense.  And often the substantive judgment is overturned.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I do find myself thinking, though, that the courts seem more interested in writing eloquent law than in achieving timely justice.  Nobody cares (or nobody should care) about whether a judgment has the eloquence of Lord Denning (or whoever).  People should care about timely justice.  I thought that would have been the difference between law in the courts and law in the universities.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            In order to have a case heard on appeal you need to (1) file and serve an application (2) pay the filing fee or apply for it to be waived (3) apply for a hearing (4) pay a fee for the hearing and it is usual, also, for security for costs to be paid into a trust.  These things are supposed to happen within 20 days of the High Court Judgment else the appeal is deemed to have been abandoned.  But you can apply for extensions of time from the courts.  I have been prompt with my filings and my applications for waiver of fees but required to apply for extra time while the court determined whether or not the fees would be waived.  Then the judgment of the court that they not be waived could itself be appealed.  In this manner things have been forced to become 'meta' while I apply for extension after extension after extension of time to have the case heard on appeal.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I do understand that the reason the Court of Appeal judgments read better is because of the extra work that has gone into producing them.  But they don't pay me they don't pay me they don't pay me they don't pay me they don't pay me.  I am not a lawyer and they don't pay me.  I am not even a law student where there are prospects to pay me with a JD for my contribution to the development of law with respect to getting the cases through.  I am not a lawyer.  That's why they force me to do this.  As slave.  They don't pay me they don't pay me they don't pay me they don't pay me.  It's hard for me to get past that.  That's why my friends say from overseas.  The ones who left New Zealand.  They say:  'They pay me they pay me they pay me they pay me they pay me'.  New Zealand is really rather renowned for keeping slaves.

                            <p>If you want to be a surgeon then study carpentery.  If you want to be prime-minister study con-munications.  If you want to be a politician go to medical school.  If you want to work the plantations over summer then enrol in a PhD.  If you want to work for 3.4 years before submitting a thesis for a 3 EFT PhD with the Univerity of Otago before undergoing 3 months of external examination and then an oral defense and then...  How many years of changes?  To be held indefinately...  And if you protest then you pay the courts.  Right?  You pay them you pay them you pay them you pay them you pay them you pay them you pay...</p>

                            <p>I have the right to get justice by smashing people's heads in with hammers.  I voluntariliy choose to give up my unrestricted right to get justice by smashing people's heads in with hammers in exhange for the New Zealand Government providing access to justice.  It's called the 'social contract'.  And when the Government violates the social contract of the people by taking all the tax money and doing corrupt things with it instead of funding necessary social services..  Paying people to provide quality legal aid and nursing care and...  Then it's nasty bruitish and short, indeed.</p>
