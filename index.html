 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->

                            <article>
  

    <p>The Australian Constitution says explicitly that New Zealand is a state of Australia.  But Australia doesn't seem to think that they have to honor their constitution.  So they simply deny it.  They simply refuse to give New Zealanders voting papers for federal elections, and so forth.  They treat New Zealanders, for the most part, as second or third class Australians.  I think it is because of the history of being a prison colony the leaders govern, still, like they are leading a prison colony.  That is or means to say they treat the majority of the people as underclass criminals and the elite minority rule as prison guards or slavers.  
    </p>

    <p>There don't seem to be Universities in Australasia.  They seem to think that there isn't anything more to having a University qualificatation than they choose you to be a slaver.  I mean to say they are not processing applications to enroll, progressions, completions, on academic grounds.  Instead, they refuse to supply applications, they throw applications away arbitrarily, they refuse to get work to examiners so as to prevent and prohibit international community from signing off on completions in order to keep people as slaves.  </p>

    <p>They write that you are required to be re-enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled so that the Univerity gets more and more and more money for keeping you enrolled while they refuse to get your work out to external examiners.  Not because they believe external examiners would fail you -- they are happy to fail you themselves by refusing to get your work out.  They don't get your work out to examiners because they believe the examiners would  pass you.  But they aren't allowed to pass you.  Because they are the only game in town.  Nobody else is around therefore all of the money for them.  </p>

    <p>I have documented on the writing page various work that I did for various Universities of Australasia.  From the University of Waikato to the Australian National University.  They won't get my graduate research to examiners.  They won't get it to examiners.  Then they send it out for examination for the wrong qualification.  Then they refuse to get my updated work to examiners.  Then they instruct me to make changes from it that were quite different from those required by externals and make me take at least 6 additional months to do them (on a 1 year research enrolment) and when the international community requests an oral examination to see what the hell is going on they record on my transcript that I failed.  How hard can it possibly be to do a 1 year research project with the University of Waikato?  It is impossible, apparently, because they will not get your work to external examiners.  THey are not keeping Universities they are keeping prison detention or slave camps.  Up and down these lands. </p>

    <p>The judiciary does not appear to function.  That might be because they aren't processing applications, progressions, completions of Legal Training.  I mean to say, they likely aren't handling the Law Qualifications with any more integrity than the other kinds of applications.  They are throwing away applications from domestic adults for Medicine.  They choose to fill up the training programme with teenagers and then not give them their qualifications.  Then they put them to 'work' in the hospitals.  Only, the students pay the university, pay the university, pay the university for their ongoing 'training' while the University refuses to give them their qualificiation because it isn't going to pay them.  THey must pay the university pay the university pay the university.  Then it is time for the detaineee slave prisoner to go away.  To be replaced by another student who must pay the university pay the university pay the university.</p>

    <p>The Judiciary has heard a number of cases from me at the High Court level.  Apparently I am supposed to pay for the crimes of the Univesrities.  I am supposed to pay the courts for the crimes of the Universities.  I am required to revise and resubmit and revise and resubmit and revise and resubmit my filings with the courts because they refuse to process or progress filings.  I am supposed to opay the courts pay teh courts pay teh courts.  The government refuses to instruct Crown Law to prosecute statutory violation from the Universities.  The Universities are not functioning in these lands.  They are functioning as yet another institution of abuse.  There's nothing here.  Nobody home in this part of the world.  </p>

    <p>They are refusing to progress the cases through the court of appeal.  They delayed everything since aroudn this time last year.  THey demand I pay more than twenty thousand dollars security for costs to the courts because I must pay for the crimes of the universities, I must pay, I must pay, I must pay.  I must pay for their refusal to process applications to enrol, refusal to progress students through training, refusal to sign off on qualififation completion or give work to externals and allow externals to sign off. I must pay the courts I must pay the courts I must pay the courts for their crimes.  There is nothing in this part of the world.  The leaders choose to govern these lands as prison camp detention facilities.  They pretend to be too stupid to read their own constitution.  The judiciary refuses to uphold the law.  There aren't any universities.  Prison slave detention camps.  Up and down the land.</p>
