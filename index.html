 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">

                            <p>When the USMLE (United States Medical Lisencing Examination) made graduating from one of their acknowledged medical schools within the past 5 years a necessary pre-condition for certification...  The game was up.  I mean to say...  There is soooo much corruption going in to who is accepted into medical school and who is graduated from medical school.  More particularly, corruption with respect to who is prohibited and prevented.  Not because they are keen to keep out psychopaths and wrongful deathbringers.  Sexual offenders.  Child abusers.  Quite the converse.  They don't care how much or how well you know the USMLE content.  Not the theory.  Not the practice.  Not the clinical skills.  None of it.  You can't sit the lisencing examinations and get qualified to practice if and only if you demonstrate competence in the examinations.  It's just...  Corruption.  Through and through.  There's actually genuinely and truly nothing there.  Nothing of any value to be found.  In spite of.  Despite.  Not at all because of.  Just waiting for a generation to die so that other people can live.</p>

                            <p>The health system complains:  'We don't have enough beds' 'we are sending people away when we believe they would be better off in hospital' 'we are sending people away who are asking us for help'.  Why?  How many hostages are there, being kept in the hospital when they don't want to be?  Only treat the involuntary.  Wah wah wah wah wah there isn't enough funding for mental health.  Wah wah wah there aren't enough mental health practitioners for everyone to have the help they ask for.  Wah wah wah.  Only treat the involuntary.  Round them up like animals and court order them to be detained involuntarily in the name of compulsory medical treatment.  Wah wah wah there never will be enough for people who want help to have the help they need.  Only treat the involuntary non-consenting.  Only the involuntary non-consenting in the name of psychiatry.  There's no health system.  State institution of abuse up and down the land.  Not even trying to be fair.  The courts are delaying proceedings until people die.  They can't / won't do anything.  Pathetic.  Inept.  Corrupt.  What health system?  Can't process applications to enrol, progresssions through training, completions of training.  Can't publically advertise jobs, employ those qualified for them.  Won't pay the workers.  When it's time for us to pay you it's time for you to be deported.  For your crimes you did, for the NZ government.  Your role in the government institutions of abuse and torture and wrongful death and wrongful imprisonment.  Up and down the land.  There's nothing here.</p>

                            <p>Chris Hipkins expected to be able to say that he didn't see anything wrong.  He expected to be able to say it's like he had his eyes poked out.  No minister expected the police to be doing Dawn Raids.  To never have stopped doing them.  In fact...  Probably all the Ministers would say that something something about independence of the Police or separation of the Ministries and Politics and Politicians and the Executive or Police means that they can't say or do anything about the Police at all.  I mean, they reckon they can't inquire of the Judiciary when a Judgment is going to be outputted for a case that was heard more than 6 months ago...  Thereby establishing that the Judiciary of NZ doesn't belive that Justice is an essential need for people of NZ.  It doesn't see any people.  Reappointing Justice Toogood (not proper process) instead of appointing a Judge via proper process.  He doesn't see anything wrong either.  That is the expectation, right?  That he's either stupid or blind or both.  Incompetent or corrupt or both.  No speak English or no have the capacity to understand it or both.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/pou-tiaki/131927004/south-auckland-dawn-raid-criticised-by-pacific-community-leader  The purpose of the apology?  Well...  One way to think about it...  What was the purpose of the Cartwright Inquiry?  The people thought that one renegade or rogue person was actually held to account for wrongdoing and processes and so on were put into place to ensure that nothing like that ever happens again.  But actually, the reality of the Cartwright Inquiry is that various medical and related fields professionals say 'poor poor poor Dr Green.  It wasn't like he was doing anything differently from what any and everybody else in the field is doing.  He was scapegoated...  He's a national hero.  Let's build a monument to him he's like Jesus being unfairly persecuted for all of the good work he did wrongful deathing a bunch of people who wouldn't have died otherwise in an environment that's sooooooo competitive'.  So...  A public apology for the Dawn Raids.  Well, in the NZ context or in the context of NZ it basically means 'game on' with respect to 'hahahaha what are you going to do about it?  You and whose army?!' </p>

                            <p>The NZ Government wants to say that Australia is 'agressively recruiting' nurses, for example.  Not that they are 'attractively recruiting nurses'.  They want Australia to stop 'agressively recruiting nurses' (because they are concerned for the welfare of the nurses being given violently aggressive offers from overseas, one can only suppose) and they don't want Australia to stop 'attractively recruiting nurses' by offering them fairer wages and better working conditions than how NZ prefers to keep the slaves a slaving by not giving them the qualifications they were supposed to hand over after however many years of internship slavery while they paid and paid and paid the universities for increasing levels of debt against their name only.  While they were treated like crap.  It's sooooooo competitive, says the people who make their money requring them to re-re-re-re-re-re-re- enroll and hand over more and more and more and more money while they refuse to sign off on their internships and bully and abuse them into paying more and more and more money only.  Isn't it terrific that the NZ government cares soooooo muuuuuuch about nurses that it wants to prevent and prohibit them from being recruitable overseas so as to keep them as poorly as it can get away with for as long as it can get away with it...  Nasty nasty nasty slavers.  Our property!  Hands off foreign nations!  Our slaves.  We arrange our economy so that certain people are on payroll for the keeping of slaves.  We pay some people hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year (they are most valued) to keep other people as hostages or slaves only.  No intention of signing off on completion of their qualifiation.  No intention of supplying references attesting to the quality and integrity of their work.  No intention of allowing anybody to give fair wages to their slaves.  Only the intention of having their positions on the social hierarchy where they profiteer and make all their money off of the keeping of slaves.  They will not pay the workers.  They will not pay the workers.  They won't pay workers.  They will just get a new intake of students a slaving.  Handing over to them all of the money while they do all of the work while they teach their hidden curriculum of how many wrongful deaths can we  bring today?  Who wants to maim and harm and kill and torture?  Who wants to be positioned in a hospital where you can withhold pain medication and claim that since you are the only nurse they will allow and you cant' do everything all by yourself this is how you will have to keep them?  Who will want to work only in unsafe staffing levels so that you are providing unsafety only? Training them training them training them...  To inflict them on local populations...  NO fair wah!!!! Cries the NZ Government that Australia wants them to go wrongful death a bunch of 'other' over there...</p>

                            <p>I mean, we aren't even trying to be fair.  Are we???  YOu pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the Universities.  And the Universities (whose primary function is supposed to be research) employs people with what research output again?  What University??  PRison.  Slave.  Detention camp.  Not even trying to be fair.  They aren't offering jobs for nurses.  THey have recruitment firms collecting up people's data only.  SO people like Peter Crampton can throw the applications away.  Tell the nurses they need to re-re-re-re-re-re-re- re enrol in further training.  Never stop paying.  Never stop paying.  Never stop paying the 'university' for re-enrolment in courses where tehy can put you to work for no wages.  Scummy hoax of a farce of a scam.  There' snothing here.  They will not pay the workers.</p>

                            <p>The point of 'changing the name' of, for example, the University of Otago and Victoria University of Wellington is to...  Remove any international recognition or good-will or good-feeling about studnets applying claiming to have qualifications from those places.  I mean to say, they are basically trying to dis-establish or de-establish the various Universities of NZ.  To recognise that we don't have Universities, in fact.  We don't want to have Universities, in fact.  We want to keep slave, prison, detention camps full of slaves who will do the nations work while only recording ever increasing levels of debt against their name.  The point is that various alumni want to preserve options for themselves.  Want to keep for themselves the qualifications they have been acknowledged with and credited with.  Keep those things for themselves.  Refuse to grant any new qualifications or degrees to anybody who is not them.  Maybe give degrees to their dependent children.  Maybe.  Depending on the nature of their psychopathy (whether nepotism is part of their particular brand of it or whether they are equal opportunity psychopaths with no willingness or ability to refrain from eating their own children, even)...  The alumni don't actually want there to be new graduates.  And NZ as a country doesn't want any other nation to be offering actual pay cheques to anybody from NZ.  The NZ people are the property of the NZ government.  Clearly.  To be kept slaving in NZ institutions of abuse up and down the land.  Indignation at the thought that some people actually get away from NZ.  Make it out.  Earn a pay check for doing skilled labor.  What an affront.  Everything the government has done to raise an under-class of gamma baby degenerates only to do all of the work for none of the recognition and none of the pay..  Our property.  Graduates of the University of thioreghfj84r93oghfjk.  And when the foreign prospective employers check with the Univesrity to see if the student actually did the work or graduated NZ can say 'nonononono no no.  This person is a filthy degenerate who is deserving only of being kept unlawfully detained forever in a NZ government institution of abuse'.  Of course.  Quite the scummity-scam.  How's the blackbirding going for teenage slaves this year, Chris Whelan?  Find any 14 year olds to be detained in teh name of psychiatry after them being raped (not caught on camera, of course) in one or the other of the University residential halls???</p>

                            <p>Psychopathic things psychopathic people say. 'We can't backdate your enrolment start date'.  Fact.  Undergraduate students have up to 2 weeks into the start of A B and Y semester courses to finalise their enrolments.  That means to say undergraduate studnets can enrol in a course that started Monday of week one on friday of week two.  So they do, regularly, as a matter of course, backdate enrolment start dates.  Psychopathic things that psychopathic people say. 'We can't put your enrolment start date down as 05 March 2018 (even when you applied by the application deadline and have email evidence of your named supervisor instructing you how to search for readings on the 05 March 2018) because wah wah wah wah wah...  Instead we will record your enrolment start date as 01 May 2018 and call what happened previously free labor from you for us.  Shame on me for doing what my supervisor told me to do (and sending her weekly writings).  My bad.  I should pay I should pay I should pay.  I applied by the application deadline and they refuse to process my application for the progarmme of study  applied to.  I was the ONLY APPLICANT FOR THE PROGRAMME.  So we understand, now, the nature of the competition.  It isn't from the peers.  It is from the nasty nasty filthy slavers.</p>

                            <p>In early March of 2019 I get sent a letter saying I 'do not qualify to complete' a 120 point programme of research for the 2018 academic year.  Instead, in order for me to get credit for having written a masters research thesis I need to be re-enrolled in a 2019 programme of study so the univesrity can get more and more and more money for having me re-re-re-re-re enrolled.  They propose that my enrolment start date be 01 January 2019.  The University isn't even open on the 01 January 2019.  It is closed for the teaching recess ffs.  They want to backdate my enrolment start date to then.  They say.  In March.  After wah wah wah wah wahing about how impossible it was for them to enrol me with 05 March 2018 enrolment start date when I applied by the application deadline because they chose to delay processing my enrolment so as to yakkity yak yak yak about me for PhD scholarship in a meeting of PhD applicants WHEN I NEVER APPLIED TO BE ENROLLED IN THEIR PHD PROGRAMME.  I mean...  There is stupid and there is something different entirely.  Beyond stupid, I think we call it.  Unbelievably beyond stupid.  Over and above all the requirements for stupid.  F*cking psychopaths.  Allllll of the payroll for them to keep slaves.  They don't want a medical school for Waikato, at all.  All they want is the enrolment fees associated with medical school enrolment.  So they can put the slaves to work in the hospitals while the slaves pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the university.  Bonded labor is beside the point, you see.  The nature of the problem is something different, entirely...</p>

                            <p>Hey Australasia...  Why don't you pay your workers?  Pay your workers?  Pay your workers?  Pay your workers? Why won't you pay your workers?  Pay your workers?  Pay your workers?  Why won't you pay your workers?  Why won't you pay your workers?  Hey, pay your workers.  Pay your workers.</p>

                            <p>Free Citizens Advice Lawyers (aka not worth the money it's not even paid says): 'Why don't you pay the university, pay the university, pay the university?  Why dont' you pay the university (for programmes of study that I never applied to because I didn't need to apply to re-enrol since I'd done the work for the qualification I applied ot already and it's time for htem to give me the f*ckign qualification)...  Why don't you pay the university pay the universiety why don't you pay the university...  I don't need to pay the university...   The University simply tells the IRD that I owe them more fees and the IRD tells me that that is so.  Even when I never applied to that programme of study.  They record increasing levels of debt against my name only.  Nasty nation of slavers.  There's nothing here.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  HOw much work did you output in 2018 Justine Kingbury?  How much money did they pay you, in 2018 to be a university employee with the primary function of doing research?  What was your research output?  What would you say your students research output was, in 2018?  Your graduate research students? What did they output?  IN spite of you or because of you?  Are you facilitating research out preventing and prohibiting?  Why do they pay you?  Or maybe they don't pay you.  You just tell everyone that your postion on the social hierarchy is thus and so and they put your name on an office door because they don't plan on paying anybody to actualy work that job.  Like the guy who said he was a medical doctor (with time practicing in Boston) and they paid him 60,000 a year to pass himself off as medical doctor knowing full well he was a fraud -- because they were never going to pay anybdoy fair wages to work that job at all.  HOaxes and frauds and scummy scams and nasty slavers only need apply.  NOt even trying ot be fair at all.</p>

                            <p>'wah wah wah.  we can't / won't graduate our students because then someone will pay them to do the job that they do presently while paying the university paying the university paying the university paying the university.  wah wah wah wah wah we will never never never never never sign off on completion of their degree.  they can keep doing all the research work and pay pay paying they will keep paying they can pay and pay and pay the university.  we will never never never sign off on completion of their degree.  they do all of the work while they pay and pay and pay and pay the university'.</p>

                            <p>graduate our research-slaves?!  never!!  if we graduated them then someone else would pay them.  they might get a job overseas.  in australia or somehere outside nz.  but they are our slaves!  our property!  they do all of the work while they pay and pay and pay and pay us so that we can ponce about the world on conferences and the like with no research output of our own, only passing off their research output as our own.  we will never never never graduate our worker research slaves.  we will re-enrol them in programes of study they never even applied for.  says the courts.  we will never never free our worker slaves.  we will never never never acknowledge the work that they do.  all of the work from them.  all of the money for us.  to re-re-re-re-re- enrol in programmes they never even applied to.  5 years of bonded f*cking labor?  What a f*cking joke:  The glorious Kim Sterelny says:  'NZ does not believe in BONDING they believe in BRANDING'.  MONGREL MOB FOREVER on their faces.  There is no out.  Our property.  There is no out.  Our property.  Our property.  Our worker research slaves.  No graduation.  Nobody will play them.  Nobody will pay them locally.  Nobodoy will pay them internationally.  The social hierarchy must be preserved.  All and only those without capacity and / or willingness to do any work get alll of the money and titles and positions and powers to do none of the f*cking work.  Just keeping their research slaves.  Nasty filty disgusting nation of slavers.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  What Univesrity?  What Judiciary? What education and training system?  What a f*cking joke.</p>

                            <p>5 year bonding scheme?  Is that 5 years *post-graduation?*  But they aren't graduating students.  Why would you graduate a student when you can get them slaving their slave 'job' while paying the university paying the university paying the university paying the university for re-re-re-re-re-re-re enrolment while the university refuses to get their work out to external examiners, while the university refuses to accept that international community signed off on completion of the internship requirement?  They aren't graduating students who have met requirements for the qualifications becuase they get money for keeping them re-re-re-re-re enrolled while getting them doing the work while only recording increasing levels of debt against their name.  How much research output did the University of Waikato Philosophy Department output in 2018?  How about Canterbury?  More or less than 5,000 words per employee?  ffs.</p>

                            <p>
                                "This is a circumstance of our current economy where there's lots and lots of jobs. But at some point and we know this happens, a lot of trainees are going to find no one wants to have them with them, a whole lot of apprentices are going to find they need somewhere to train because companies are letting them go." https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/488955/te-pukenga-hopeful-work-based-funding-change-will-offset-other-income-drops  That is an interesting perspective.  Just checking my understanding...  The plan is that the teenagers (who are entitlted to free secondary school education until they attain the age of 20 years) are going to be enrolled in polytech or unitec or university or prison detention or slave camp courses (whatever you want to call them) where the studnets will have increasing levesl of debt against their name and the polytech or unitec or university or prison detention or slave camp will put them to work with the vague promise that they'll give them a certificate or degree of completion after however many years of labor.  Only, the Government actively gives the prison camps money for recording increasing levels of re-enrolment only and the camps can't / won't even keep accurate records of the involuntary detentions (after Justice Toogood found in the High Court that there wasn't anything wrong with the University of Waikato recording a student being re-enrolled in a programme of study they never applied to be enrolled in that set precedent, you see).  Justice Toogood was reappointed from his retirement (put back on payroll, apparently, so that there would be no position of Judge for a new person coming through.  Someone else can be appointed judge only over his dead body, it seems, why would he voluntariliy choose to walk away from his payroll?)  What developed nation?  F*cking farce of a hoax of a scummy scummy scam.  There aren't really any jobs in NZ, are there?  People like Chris Whelan get paid (by the government) to see no wrong.  To throw complaints of wrongdoing away.  They keep advertising and readvertising for non-research university academic positions (where the one defining feature of universities was supposed to be active production of research).  Nothing here. </p>

                            <p>  A lot of the supposed or apparent jobs that are being offered seem to be b*llsh*t.  Unclear if they ever actually intend to fill the position (or only waste the time of people applying, perhaps even making malevolent use of the data they collect in the application process.  There appear to be quite a few jobs working for 'recruitment firms'.  How can one possibly make money working for a recruitment firm?  Do they take a cut of the salary?  How do they make their money?  Then what is it that you do, working for a 'recruitment firm', exactly?  Advertise and re-advertise and re-advertise.  Interview and re-interview.  Collect up however many people who you can persuade have the same skillset to 'negotiate' for lower wages for them all.  It's sooooooooo competitive.  The jobs that are advertised by employment firms with no named company or business or whatever.  Just bogus.  To pretend like there are actually jobs being offered, in NZ.  Even Jacinda Ardern had to flee.  No job for her, in NZ.  There's nothing here.</p>

                            <p>The problem is not that there isn't enough money.  The problem is the awful people who are determined to be head of some social hierarchy, likely  because they think that nobody would voluntariliy choose to spend any time at all with them if they didn't grubby grub up all the money and force others to be dependent.  Slavers. </p>

                           

                            <p>I think that's pretty much what happens in the world.  You take people who have morality and ethics, regard for the other..  And you bully them and torture them and abuse them and harm them and injure them and mock them..  To try and eliminate out of them any good will or kindness or anything like that.  I mean, the more they persecuted Jesus and Socrates and Ghandi and..  Well, there are lots of examples from lots of different cultures..  The more they persecuted them the...  Less those figures cared about humanity?  Right?  Isn't that how the story goes?  You can simply torture beneficience and so on out of a person, can't you?  Isn't that the great NZ experiment with the trickle down economics?  See if you can get them gnawing each others arms off after them being pissed all over by a small elite minority for however many years?  Isn't that the goal?  Socially engineer the prisoners to be immoral psychopaths.  It isn't the people keeping others in conditions of torture and abuse and so on who are immoral.  They are subjectively doing fine.  That makes them moral, didn't you know?  Didn't you know that morality = winning = being highest up the social hierarchy.  Isn't that what morality means according to those with all the power on earth?  Forever and ever and ever amen.  Ascended to Gods they have, in virtue of being better than everybody else.</p>

                            <p> `Our research has shown that a person's subjective wellbeing - how they evaluate their life circumstances, experiences and feelings in relation to the people around them - needs to be good before they have room for moral and ethical consumer dilemmas such as sustainability, the environment and fair wages'.  https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/488651/a-decade-after-the-rana-plaza-factory-disaster-new-zealanders-still-rely-on-fast-fashion  I don't  believe that for a minute.  Only if I rate myself better off than you can I have regard for you?  Really?  Does that seem likely?  Oh.  Morality and ethics regarding fairness towards the other is costly to the individual.  If we can keep enough individuals in enough deprivation then we won't need to worry about anybody having any kind of morality or regard for anybody else.  Is that the social experiment, then?  See how badly we can treat people (in the name of trickle down economics) while inducing in them a selfishness self preservation immorality while the chortle chortle snort pat ourselves on the backs we are doing better than you's are the only ones willing or able to display or demonstrate any kind of ethics or morality.  Those who have the most in the present life are due most riches in the afterlife, too, of course, that seems plausible doesn't it?  They still doing the social engineering experiment on how to get the unruly masses gnawing each others arms off, then?  </p>

                            <p>How to breed a terrorist..  How to breed a terrorist..  How to have the world go 'awwwwww pooooooor yoooooou you were unfairly targeted by terrorists awwwwwww pooooooor you.'  Look to you to seek comfort.  How do we breed terrorists?  How do we breed terrorists?  How do we induce certain people to take the blame for all of the terrorist activity in the world?  Quite the conundrum for any leader..  How to get the people looking to oneself for comfort and guidance..  Doing anything anything anything one says in order to avoid being targeted by terrorists...</p>

                            <p>The aim was to torture kids in the schools, people in the hospitals etc etc so that the people would no longer present for social services.  Correct?  If you treat them badly enough in the schools and the hospitals then either they are 'asking for it' (the courts would say it was the victims fault) or else they will simply stop presenting for those services.  That way you don't have to pay teachers, doctors, nurses.  You can see about taking those who were struck off for atrocities, overseas.  Else, getting a bit more sophisticated, ones who might come under investigation because enoguh complaints have been (attempted to have been but not actually formally acknowledged) as having been lodged against their name.  Try and identify the biggest nastiest most psychopathic of the bullies and abusers and headhunt them for all the qualities that you value.  Put them into the public schools and hospitals.  But why stop there?  The same people work in private as in public.  You likely don't have to pay them.  You can find people like Dr Leeks who can figure a way to make money off of pimping the children out.  Then, later in life, the courts can say they need to say just how monumentally influential Dr Leeks was over and over and over and over and over and over.  Make it defining of their lives until the day they die.  Never stop paying never stop paying never stop paying the courts.  Sorry, the 'courts'.  Never stop paying for the crimes of the NZ governemnt, the only people who would be acknowledged as the leaders of NZ by overseas...  Never stop paying never stop paying never stop paying...  F*cking psychopaths.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>See you in a couple decades Jacinda.  Class of 2044 was it?  When you are due to graduate from your one semester long certificate programme.  They'll probably not extradite you for over-staying, but I'm sure it will be fun for you to go camping for a while, or however you want to view that as.  Don't forget to pay, Jacinda!  Don't forget to pay them!  Don't forget to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay.  </p>

                            <p>The goal.  I suppose the ideology is that they will just say that there was an online terrorist attack and so what happened was that payroll systems in NZ don't work anymore.  Nobody is on payroll anymore.  No income goes into anybodies bank accounts anymore.  Nothing there.  No birth certificates.  No passports.  No education qualifications.  No health records.  Nothing.  No information on any people from NZ.  From where?  Then we can march them off into submarines and drown them in the ocean.  Good idea? Start all over with a new cohort or generation of teenagers who will do all of the work while increasing leveld of debt are recorded against their names,  only.  That's a great plan.  Right?  Herd them off into death camps in the name of 'education and training' and pick them off one at a time.  Mason Pendrous.  There's one down.  Justice Toogood (pulled from retirement) doesn't see anything wrong.  But why think he's been pulled from retirement, at all?  Why think he has written any of the judgments at all?  Maybe they are simply the output of the post-modernist judgment generator.  'There could be no evidence admitted to these courts or accepted by these courts that could or would attest to corruption from the NZ government'.  You don't need an actual person to spit out the inevitable 'there is no justice at all' output of the 'courts' of NZL.  What judiciary?  What education and training system?  Can't / won't process applications to enrol.  Can't / won't acknowledge progression through training programmes.  Can't / won't graduate all and only those who have actually met requiremetns for qualifications.  Busy busy busy designing 'impossible' qualifications.  'There could be no person such that they have completed the requirements of a NZ degree programme' (because they intentionally designed it to be impossible to complete) while simultaneously saying that this, that, and the other person is credited with or awarded as having the qualification (which they never met requirements for either) because...  Because it's a f*ckign garbage dump of a f*cking garbage waste-rubbish-waste land.  Right, Sterelny?  Overtaken by psychopaths.  The way you wanted the world to be, was it?  Sooooo motivating and inspiring...  The worst of the socio-biology from the 1960's.  Yawn.</p>

                            <p>The NZ Government was so f*cking busy trying to force people to have a vaccination for Covid-19 (when the vaccination at that time was approved for use only under 'emergency authorisation only', which is to say it was an experimental vaccine, at that stage)...  The government was sooooooo busy trying to coerce and force people to having the experimental vaccine (even when there were not really any deaths from Covid in these parts)...  Sooo busy trying to force compliance...  To the point of people being removed from jobs and employment if they did not comply...  Sooo busy trying to force the involuntary only treat the involuntary only do experiments in the name of medical research on the non-consenting involuntary..  Meanwhile parents can't get the standard old regular MMR vaccines for their kids etc because apparently Chris Hipkins tiny little brain can only comprehend or consider involuntarily forcing one vaccine at a time.  What health system?  Let's withold the treatment options that people want (for informed reasons, like the vaccines that have been approved already for regular use) so that people from Harvard or wherever can run experiments on the NZ people.  Where people from NZ are co-erced and forced to comply whether they want to or not.  Great way to lead a country.  I don't think anybody would voluntarily choose to vote for that.  Unless, of course, there was no alternative.  What health system?  What education and training system?  Let's see the qualifications and credentials, then, of the Medical Doctor who testified that the infant needed to have the operation (that he would not grow out of his condition as his heart grew) and also the evidence that it was impossible for the mother or another person to be the donor.  What happens to the kid if the mother rejects it after the government has placed it's f*cking pawprints grubby hands all over it?  Birds reject their eggs and offspring if a person decides to be all helpful and get in there and mess around with things for a while.  Who pays for the fallout from disrupting the mother-child bond.  Wow.  Who wouldn't want to be a Dr Leeks in NZ, or Australia.  I see why it's soooooooooo competitive.  It's sooooo competitive in fact that nobody actually is allowed to practice medicine at all.  There's actually nothign there.  Yet another state institution of abuse.  Just like the courts, hey.  The 'Universities'.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.</p>

                            <p>  https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/baby-w-case-te-whatu-ora-spent-26000-on-lawyer-fees-over-baby-blood-donor-case/2JWTAERK7NFL3MI3YIS3VHYCJ4/  The government spent $26,000 to have the courts award custody of the child (for medical experimentation purposes) to a person that the government chooses to keep on their payroll as 'medical professional'.  The government spent more than $80,000 to have the university refuse to enrol me in medical training (even when I was rank order scored high enough for offer of place).  The lengths they go to to enforce compliance.  The judge delivered his judgment quickly quickly quickly under urgency it's an emergency.  There was no time for medical professionals not on the NZ government payroll to testify, to give evidence that the procedure the NZ payrolled doctor wanted to carry out was one that even needed to have been done, at all.  Urgency urgency it's an emergency.  Ms Roe waits more than 5 months, now, for a judgement out of the courts regarding the social security appeals authority's decision as to whether Justice is an essential need, or not.  The courts refuse to deliver a judgment on whether justice is an essential need or not.  The government spent I don't know how much in external legal counsel fees to assert before the court that justice is not an essential need and the courts haven't delivered a judgment on that, more than 5 months later. </p>

                            <p>What's Jacinda going to do when she gets back from overseas?  What kind of job is she going to get...  I've been looking through the jobs advertised on trade-me and seek and wonder what skilled labor job she will get in NZ.  I know..  She should re-enroll with a university and pay them more and more and more money for more and more training!  What a great idea!  Never stop paying the prison camp detention camp wasteland of NZ.  Never stop paying.  Never stop paying.  Never stop paying.  What a great idea.  That's brilliant.  The people of NZ should never stop paying for the crimes of the NZ government.  What's that?  You aren't in government anymore.  Awww.  Poor you.  Maybe the Harvard people can muster up enough 'like share and subscribes' so you can pass yourself off as being back in parliament.  Who counts the votes anyway?  kim.com?  He's providing the cloud servers for NZ is he?  He pays the courts.  Right?  He pays and pays and pays and they bloat the proceeding and refuse to extradite him to stand trial.  ANd they intentionally market to the world that people should come here, commit crimes, and then simply leave.  The police won't do anything.  We don't have prosecutors.  Nobody applied to Law School, apparently.  Only people on payroll were paid to throw the applications away so they could record more and more and more debt against people's names when those people never even applied to the programme.  Did you apply to go to Harvard, Jacinda?  Or you got 6 months detention somewhere in the US.  Are you actually going to be based in Boston?  I guess they have more than a few detention facilities in those parts.  Enjoy your room-share.</p>

                            <p>The Australians were sending their Doctor-Troops up through Florida.  The idea/l was that the University of Queensland would preferentially enrol the Vice Chancellor's daughter because of corruption and arrange for the Medical Students to sit (and presumably cheat them a pass) on the USMLE examinations and they would send them, then, on internships up through Florida.  Put them to work in the death camps, I mean aged care institutions, I mean death camps, of Florida.  I guess because the students throught the aged care institutions of the USA would be preferable to the death camps, the concentration camps, the asylum refugee camps, in Australia.  They didn't want to work the Australian death camps (even when they do everything everything everything they can to preferentially select for psychopaths including selecting students who must know full well they have been magicked in to having a place at all because of corruption)...  Corruption...  Corruption...  Corruption...  I actually know a few graduate students who were selected into graduate level Medical Programmes in Australia and also Undergraduate level Medical Programmes in Australia (as grads - presumably to give them a shot at USMLE)...  WHo were subsequently deployed to NZ as 'junior doctors'.  Where they were to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for further study and fees and training and pay and pay and pay and pay.  Never stop paying.  Never stop paying.  Scummy hoax of a scummy scam.  There's nothing there. </p>

                            <p>How much money are they paying you Jacinda?  To go do your one semseter certificate programme?  How much money are they paying you?  Do you get to live on campus?  Do you twin-share with another certificate student?  Do they include text-books for you?  Did you apply to go do that, then?  Get in an application by an application deadline.  Have it considered on it's academic merits?  Do you pay them?  How much money do you have to pay the private school for your one semster certificate programme?  Is it meant to pave the way for you to come back to NZ and keep students in NZ universities re-enrolled indefinately in a programme you can never graduate them from since you can't supervise them since you were never enrolled in, never did the work for, and were never graduated from any actual graduate level university degree.  What a f*cking joke.  Oooh.  Who wants to go to Harvard?  What are you going to give them lectures about, then?  How Harvard sets you up to to fashion spreads in Ali Barber clothes etc to make a f*ckimg mockery of NZ?  Do you pay them to sell out the health of the NZ people or do they pay you?  Trying to get a handle on the situation..  I wonder if you actually did go to Waikato.  The great con-munications degree.  Yeah, right.  The great Con.  </p>

                            <p> https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/jacinda-ardern-announces-new-role-with-harvard-university/Z3TO3CJZWRGT3IVBROA2F3CONU/  Aw, that's great, she can go do a one semester certificate in how to breed on-line terrorists in exchange for all the work she's done marketing NZ as the place for the psychopathic graduates of Harvard to come do their knock-out gamma baby studies so they can feel smarter about themselves, relatively speaking.  It's great, isn't it, the interest that a private school of Boston shows in aquiring natives brains (Richard Faull's brain bank), and the like.  Was it the Marc Hauser Research Centre in how to bully your graduate 'students' into outputting false data.  The great experiment that is New Zealand.  Governed indistinguishably from a computer programme.  Social engineering experiment in how to make certain people feel all good about themselves (relatively speaking).  How many Harvard Graduates were killed 'from Covid'?  Half?  How many of the Medical Students actually Graduated when they were supposed to, anyway?  How many of them were acknowledged as having passed their examinations?  How many shipped around the world so they could play Dr Leeks.  Most revered leader.  Let's build a f*cking monument.  F*cking psychopaths. </p>

                            <p>Mason Pendrous is likely still paying fees to the University of Canterbury.  By which I mean to say they are likely claiming that he's been re-enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled to help them keep their numbers up and he's going to stay re-enrolled with them on their re-enrolment reccords until the day his thesis is accepted (only it never will be because they won't send it out, but even if they did they'd send it out for the wrong qualification, but even if they did they wouldn't listen to what the external says, but even if they did they would never never never say that he'd done enough for completion of his qualification because they get more and more and more and more money for saying that they have more and more and more and more hostages or slaves.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                            <p>I mean it makes perfect sense, doesn't it.  The world can just send it's garbage here.  What is NZ going to do about it?  Who even writes the judgments?  Who keeps payroll records?  Microsoft?  Records who is on payroll and issues a judgment.  Maybe.  Nobody on payroll who doesn't output something indistinguishable from a computer programme because there's nobody home.  Nothing here.  F*cking garbage dump of a waste land.</p>

                            <p>SSAA37/2022 (Social security appeals authority) hearing was scheduled for 20 October 2022 at the Auckland District Court.  No judgment has been supplied.  More than 6 months later.  The Prime Minister, Leader for the Opposition, Minister of Justice, and Minister for the Courts have all been notiifed.  Apparently it would interfere with independence of the Judiciary if the Politicians were to do or say anything about NZ not having a functioning judiciary.  The ideal is to refuse to enrol, acknowledge progression through training, graduate.  That way NZ will never need to pay NZers for skilled labor (not acknowledging they have any skills) and they won't be able to leave and do skilled labor either because the 'Universities' won't acknowledgde they have any skills.  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camp.  Wrong people won WWII in this part of the world -- we know this because the atrocities never stopped.  Government institutions of abuse up and down the land.  No such thing as universities.  No such thing as schools.  They won't get studnets work out to be externally examined on the basis of it's academic merits even if (despite their very very best efforts) studnets actually acquire knowledge and skills.  No such thing as hospitals.  What doctors?  They aren't processing applications to enrol, progressions through training.  They aren't graduating.  They don't publically advertise jobs.  THey give money to people from nepotism only.  Garbage rubbish dump of a wasteland.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  Garbage rubbish dump of a f*cking wasteland. </p>

                            <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/488666/junior-doctors-increasingly-leaving-before-training-as-specialists-new-estimate-suggests  The scummy scam goes like this.  You pay the university.  You pay the univesrity.  You pay you pay you pay you pay you pay you pay the university.  Harlene Hayes refused to accept that studnets who had internships signed off had completed their internships.  Refused to graduate them.  Said they could do internships in NZ, now.  They would pass them off as 'junior doctors' in the NZ hospitals while they were still paying the university for being enrolled as medical students.  Even if they do acknowledge your graduation from medical school you are supposed to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the univesrity for re-enrollment in graduate level anatomy courses and so on so they can walk you through bloated textbooks full of arbitrary facts seemingly intentionally designed to be unlearnable.  You pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the university for all your graduate level courses while you pay for exams and you pay application fees to the specialist training colleges in the hope that they will pick you to be a student.  Most of them don't get accepted to train in a specialist training college.  They aren't actually interested in training anybody.  THey just want you to pay and pay and pay the university for enrolment and pay and pay the application fees and the examination fees.  It isn't that people aren't intersted in training to be specialists it is that we don't have an education and training system.  We have a scummy scam trying to identify the next Dr Leeks most desired and desirable person to be deployed to go help the 'other'.  Even if you do get picked to be enrolled in specialist training you still have to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay, don't you?  Reenrolment in more courses?  MOre examinations?  Who examines the examination scripts?  Oh, they just pick and choose (we like that one, he's so and so's son, he will likely make a great Dr Leeks, we choose that one!).  THen it's time for you to be deported.  Oh, no, that was the only reason why we let foreigners come here and pass themselves off as doctors for a time.  So they could play doctors and nurses while paying the university and paying the specialist training colleges and paying for exams that are bogus hoaxes and pay and pay and pay.  Then be deported.  What happens to the NZ ones?  Oh, they go overseas for a time.  And they pay and pay and pay until they are deported back to NZ, no doubt.  What education and training system?  It's sooooooo compeititve.  Why would anybody help anybody?  It's all been taken over by psychopaths.  There's nothing there.  Nobody is actually allowed to do it.  Only over their dead bodies.  The dead bodies of whom?  Those collecting up all of the money at present.  For the scummy scummy scam.  There's nothing there. </p>

                            <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/pou-tiaki/131840318/human-rights-commission-appears-at-united-nations-as-work-on-undrip-stalls  Hi!!! Hey!!!! Heya!!!! Hi, you stupid f*cking sh*ts.  I wrote a 120 point thesis on the subject all the way back in 2018.  I got NO SCHOLARSHIP TO DO IT even though I'd done a Masters thesis before, done a PhD (which was never sent by the university out for external examination) then did this as YET ANOTHER masters thesis (when it should bloody well have  been funded as a post-doctoral fellowship).  THey forced me to keeeep working through the 2019 academic year as well (charging more and more money for keeping me re-re-re-re-re enrolled in a qualifiation with a 'minimum, normal, or standard time' of 120 points = 1 EFT = 34 weeks work ONLY)...  Then recorded I failed on my university transcript.  Even when the Canadian external examiner said he wanted an oral defense they refused to schedule one and recorded I failed.  Stupid f*cking sh*ts.  Wah wah wah we can't it's too hard, only the slowest and most stupid will be tasked with doing absolutely f*cking nothing nothing nothing at all. </p>

                            <p>See...  When the Constitution of Australia asserted that (regardless of consent) NZL was a State or the Federation of Australia (on grounds of expediency)...  What it MEANT was that New Zealanders who have resided in Australia for at least 4 years since some particular year can then pay and pay and pay and pay and pay Australia to take some test whereby they may be declared Australian Citizens...  Or not...  That's what the constitution of Australia meant, clearly.  In Australian English.  What's wrong with you, New Zealander?  You no speak-Australian?  You don't understand Australian Values?  What it is that Australia values?  It takes the research work and it forwards it to external examiners so that it can be externally examined on the basis of it's academic merits compared to the standard exhibited by other students who had been working for comparable amounts of time.  No?  It just keeps certain students and they can just keep doing the work and handing the work over so that certain special othter studnets can take all the credit for having done work and take all the paid employment..  Real Aussie values, right there.  Everything it is that they value.  Nevermind the stereotypes.  Check out the reality.  Too f*cking stupid to take my work that they knew I'd done (presented at conferences and workshops.  Handouts distributed of the write-ups).  Written work in their email inboxes.  F*ckign idiot psychopaths.  That's right...  I have to listen to another f*cking speech from 'you have sex and then you die, the only function of 'old' women is to look after my babies' real motivating and inspiring guy...  Tell me all about how everything has been overtaken by psychopaths such as himself.  Really motivating and inspiring.  F*cking idiots and f*ckign idiot-land.  Go to University to eat our lunch, shall we?  Have morning tea and afternoon tea and give all our work away to the North Hemisphere people on payroll for no credit for ourselves.  F*cking stupid-land of f*cking stupids.</p>

                            <p>It's just great how there are positions advertised for lecturers at NZ Universities -- but they don't want people to be engaged in research, at all.  Unless they are going to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the University for being re re re re re re re re re re enrolled in PhD programmes, of course, whereby they hand all their research over to the Univerity so that the University can refuse to get it out to externals / can give it away to externals so that people already on payroll for having a research output other places around the world can claim to be the author of it themselves...  What Universities?  They won't hire researchers...  THey won't process applications to enrol from domestic adults (wanting to record levels of debt against teenagers only).  Institutions of abuse.  It's where the world is headed -- right?  Look at all the quality hires Australia took from NZ (Dr Leeks, Harlene Hayes, Kim Sterelny).  How many PhD's worth of research did Carl Brusse have to write for the ANU to et one PhD's worth of credit?  Where did his work on personal identity go?  Did Princeton pass it off as the PhD research output of one of their own in-breds who were incapable of a research output of their own?  Maybe one of their professors, even?  Oooooh I'm sooooo sad that I don't get to stay with you as a Philsoophy academic in Australia.  There's nothing there.  Hoax of a scam of a scummy waste-land.  You're welcome.  It takes the f*cking research and it hits 'forward' to forward the research to external examiners.  Can't do the job for which it is  actually paid (help me get work done in a timely fashion).  Worse than f*cking useless Sterelny.  Worse than f*cking useless.  He dead yet?  We can pray.  FFs.    </p>

                            <p>  https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/131827672/students-caught-cheating-with-chatgpt-offered-amnesty-for-confession  It isn't hard at all to see drafts of their work in progress to know if they wrote it themselves or if they thieved it from somewhere.  Version control.  Auto-saves.  Roll the system back.  See them typing the words onto the page in real time, even.  It's  not that hard.  But of course we only want to pass and reward and empoy the cheaters.  Right?  So we can pay one person to keep a hundred slaves and claim the research output for their own.  Only game in town.  Everyone can send Kim Sterelny their research work (in his capacity as editor of a journal) and he can re-attribute authorship to people without the willingness and / or ability to do much in the way of any research at all.  Quickly quickly quickly get the children of the administration SQL injected into payroll so they can take all of the money for doing none of the work.  Micromismanaging the administration until there's nothing left.  Tragedy of the unregulated commons.  Overtaken by psychopaths like Sterelny.  Only game in town.  Everybody else turned and fled.</p>

                            <p>I don't remember who or where...  I think it was in...  Boston?  Some Psychiatrist sent actors into emergency departments saying they heard a voice saying 'thud' or 'thump' or something like that.  So they were placed under a psychiatry observation hold to assess them over a period of...  He wanted to see how long they would be detained by the hospital (if they thought they could get away with it).  Well, there are different ways of telling the story.  Of what he was doing with that, why he was doing it.  To see if psychiatric diagnosis was something objective or subjectve.  Seeing how long it would take for people to realise that there wasn't anything psychiatrically wrong with or disturbed about the actors.  They were under instructions to behave normally once they were detained.  </p>

                            <p>Anyway...  One account was that the people were kept for 30 days on average, or something.  Or maybe that one of them was.  There needed to be something external to happen because the hospital wasn't going to let the person go.  Ever..  By the looks of it.  I wonder how many people are simililarly being unlawfully detained in our 'hospitals'.  Not just in the name of psychiatry.  Against their will, I mean to say.  Imprisoned.  Literally.  Why?  For the billings.  The hospital claiming money more and more and more money for keeping more and more and more and more people imprisoned in the hospitals.  Like the universities with their re-enrolment practices.  More and more and more and more and more money for keeping the people written up as 'studnets' or 'patients' or whatever.  Hostages.  It's soooooo competitive...</p>

                            <p>THe courts will only order more and more and more and more money to be paid by you for more and more and more filings from you.  Hostages.  It's sooooo competitive...</p>

                            <p>Maaori culture outside New Zealand.</p>

                            <p>The New Zealand Government likes to tell a story whereby leaving NZ means turning your back on Maaori culture.  But the thing is, it doesn't have to be that way.  One of the themes that comes through is that the Maaori people were great voyagers.  They navigated the globe.  Who says that their final resting place or position needs to be New Zealand?  Extinction strategy.  Extermination path.  The Government takes control of the Maaori language (deciding who and what is authorative when it comes to pronounciation and grammar and even what you are and are not allowed to say).  I strongly suspect that the only way for the Maaori culture to flourish and thrive is if many of the Maaori actually do up sticks and move away.   </p>

                            <p>I pointed out to some white lady from Christchurch (who was paid to give a seminar on something to do with heatlh) that Maaori seemed to do better when they moved away from NZ. That the worst thing there was for the health of Maaori seemed to be them living in NZ.  She said that was racist.  I was puzzled by that.  It is true -- isn't it?  That the worst thing there is for the health of Maaori is actually NZ.  I'm not suggesting that people walk away from land claims...  That's not what I'm getting at.  Only, the courts don't function to uphold justice at all.  The courts have very very clearly given teeth to the notion that people will die before they get justice out of the courts of NZ.  The 'courts'.  Hiring Justice Toogood to cover up the governments crimes..  THere isn't a functioning judiciary..  Not so far as I can see...</p>

                            <p>I mean..  What is Maaori culture?  You can take your beliefs and your practices and so on with you.  You can take your traditions and your language with you.  You can take other people with you.  You can probably speak more freely (in Maaori) only away from the NZ government, in fact.  I think you would have more freedom to practice your culture without external interference if you were located outside NZ.  That's a no brainer I would have thought.  The issue, then, really, is what opportunities there really are for NZers in Australia...  I mean...  They aren't processing applications to Medicine (someone had their application thrown out so that the daughter of the Vice Chancellor could take the place instead).  They aren't processing applications to Graduate Research qualifications (the ANU threw out my application so that they could expediate selection for whoever they decided to enrol instead).  THey aren't getting research out to externals.  My PhD thesis was never given to externals.  THey kept re-enrolling and re-enrolling and re-enrolling and re-enrolling until it was time for me to leave Australia.  Thanks for your slavings.  Just hand over your work and walk away.  They aren't trying to be fair, at all.  Where is the justice for me?</p>

                            <p>I think things have taken a dive in Australia since I was there.  Certain people were moved to Australia.  Dr Leeks.  He really really made it.  Was relocated to Melbourne with full honors and awards.  He was most desirable.  Harlene Hayes.  After the number she did on Otago.  Not graduating the Medical Students so the University of Otago could grubby grub up more money for re-enrolment and re-enrolment and re-enrolment.  She's gone off to do the same for Western Australia -- right?  Having the 18 year old teenage children of this and that administrator and official gifted places in the Medical Training Programme despite their rank order score on the basis of who their parents are.  To send them forth to practice their skills on the 'other'.  See how many they can kill.  Right?  Wrongful death.  Dr Leeks 2.0?  The glorious and magnificent Kim Sterelny.  I don't think he writes half of what he's been credited with in print.  Right?  How about many of his graduates?  The ones he says did enough for their PhDs?  How many of them actually had work they wrote themselves sent out for external examination?  Any of them?  Did any of them get back reports from external examiners?  Any of them at all?  Is he dead yet?  Good grief...</p>

                            <p>Australia did not treat me very well when I was there in Australia...  Though...  Mostly that's Kim Sterelny and the awful people in the Philsophy Programme.  Apparently it's soooooooo competitive.  Says Sterelny.  And various of his studnets say it's not about who does the work -- it's about who gets credit for having done it at the end of the day.  So they get all of the credit and all of the pay.  And nobody seem to care at all about putting things right for me.  F*cking psychopaths.  There's actually  nothing of any value there.  NO values.  Not so far as I can see.</p>

                            <p>The Australian National University only last year refusing to process an application to enrol, from me.  They say my application was 'incomplete' but that was false.  Sterelny refuses to write me a reference.  Refuses to be a referee.  I work with him as my named supervisor for how many years?  For how many years and he won't even acknowledge my work output.  I give him 100,000 words + and did he even read it?  Where is the evidence of him having read it?  Did he get it to externals?  Where is the evidence of him having got it to externals.  He says it's sooooo long ago he doesn't even remember.  I am supposed to give up my life so he can keep on taking all the payroll to go off on family holidays.  Is he f*cking well dead yet?  Oh God, I hope so.  So that someone else can live, for a change.  F*cking hurry up and die you f*cking prick.  Worst Supervisor Ever.  F*cking c*nt (that's what he'd say -- right?)  F*cked the dog you f*cking c*nt.  Everybody who knows him knows...  He was a real quality hire for the ANU.  I see why he's a member of whatever academy of this and that and the other.  See who Australia chooses...</p>

                            <p>The idea, of course, is that the best of the Australians pay however many hundreds of thousands of dollars to expediate their kids into the USA.  So they need to replace their children with NZers, I guess.  What's that?  Best place in the world to churn out people you can treat as children forever...</p>

                            <p>________</p>

                            <p>Oh, hey, I'm sooooooo glad that I left Australia to come back to NZ to pursue entry to Medical School with Otago or Auckland because I was a NZ citizen (and not Australian, apparently) which meant NZ was supposed to have 'first dibs' on me, or something...  Only Otago and then Auckland thought I was garbage garbage garbage...  That's right..  The Australain National University would only accept garbage garbage garbage in their top world 3 Philosophy of Mind Programme...  I'm garbage garbage garbage.  Clearly.  Can't do a 1 year level 5 sport and exercise science program at WELTEC. That's me.  Garbage garbage garbage.  Can't do a 1 year 120 point 1 EFT MPhil with Uniersity of Waikato. Garbage that's me.  Who wants to stay in NZL..  Voluntarily???  All voluntary-like???  I don't even have entry to MBChB (an undergraduate level degree).  Garbage garbage is me.  All make way for Dr Leeks 2.0!!!!!!!!!!!! Heil!!!!!!! All Heil!!!!!</p>

                            <p>I'm sorry... Shout out to the sport and exercise science tutors at Weltec.  Jenny.  Phillip.  Che???  OMG..  WTF... You guys are actually doing the teaching...  Day to day...  And you don't even have personal homepages within the organisation.  But you guys are the rock stars.  Honestly and truely.  Your knowledge and expertise and social skills (looking at you partiticulary che..  I can't even find your website..  wtf...)...  You guys are awesome.  I don't begrudge any of you at all.  I learned so much...  But when do I get recognition for even having seen that potential in you???  I'm not supposed to go to 'work experience' because..  I don't get to have a job in the field because... Of uh..  Well what job am I supposed to have, then???  WTF...</p>

                            <p>  https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/131834539/australia-to-let-kiwis-become-citizens-after-four-years-in-major-policy-shift  Some movement in the right direction.  Since it is in the Australian Constitution that NZ is a State of the Federation of Australia, and all.  Who knows what the consequences would be if they told NZers that they were Australian's now, living under Australian Federal Law...  Who knows..  It would all be a bit much, really, were it to happen overnight.  So...  A somewhat feasible pathway to residency.  And they can always simply say the NZers failed the citizenship test for whatever made-up reason.  They failed the test.  No speak Australian.  Whatever.  But yeah...  It doesn't really do for NZ to try and keep people enslaved without any qualifications for the work they have done, without any pay.  Just expect to record levels of debt against their name, cast aspersions on their character etc etc in order to keep them slaving as domestic slaves with no alternative.  Aiming and aspiring to be the last resort garbage land that nobody would voluntarily choose to live in.  Living under the thumb of 65+++ year olds who refuse to pay anybody else and refuse to f*cking well die already and get out of the f*cking way.  </p>

                            <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/488410/otago-university-just-doesn-t-have-any-financial-resilience-union  They refuse to supply applications to enrol to candidates who are declared to be eligible (by statute) so that they can enrol teenagers (who are eligible for free secondary schooling until they turn 20).  Cry cry cry we don't have more enrolments.  They are throwing away applications to enrol from domestic adults.  Cry cry cry they don't have any enrolments.  They are throwing away applications to enrol from people who are eligible to be enrolled *by statute*.  Beyond stupid. </p>

                            <p>So, I filled out the Census forms.  One for my individual dwelling, and one for my person.  I put them in the same envelope and posted them off.  Done.  Now they tell me they received my individual dwelling form, but not my person one.  So...  I think the government has taken to throwing away the person ones.  Just throwing them away.  Then saying they didn't receive them.  Then however much money isn't going to communities (where is it going to instead?) because they refuse to acknowledge they have received Census forms.  Sounds like them.  Can't do, won't do, a Census...  </p>

No informed consent.  No internship at all.  Supply them the informed consent forms by automaton and get out of the f*cking way.  We dont' have an education and training system.  Get out of the f*cking way.  Get out of the f*cking way.  Get out of the f*cking way.  There' snothing here.  Out the awy.  Get out.  Get out.  Are you dead yet?</p>

                            <p>What is Peter Crampton doing now?  Throwing away applications to work as a health professional for a DHB or for the National Health System, now.  That's his forte -- right?  To throw away applications from people who are qualified so as to ensure that the Dr Green and Dr Leeks and so on are the only people deployed onto those positions.  So that they can comit atrocities against the NZ people.  What health system?  What education and training system?  Doesn't matter what any of the laws because there is not a functioning judiciary.  More than 4 months since a substantive hearing in the Social Security Appeals Authority and no judgment output.  No judgment output.  Extensions of time for MSD so they can hire lawyers for themselves.  Extensions of time for the MSD.  No judgment output from the courts.  No justice in the High Courts of NZ.  Won't do it.  Lawyers are not awarded legal fees from the courts.  Ms Roe is required to slave for the courts.  Refile your refiling of the refilings MS Roe.  Else we won't progress your filings.  Refile the filings of the filings slaev for t he courts Ms Roe.  Reduction in costs awarded against you for your being techincally right in a technical matter.  What justice?  What judiciary?  Nobody  home.  NOthing there.  It is in the AUstralian COnstitution that NZ is a state of Australia and they keep NZ as as slave prison detention camp only.  NObody home.  Nothing tehre.  Not even trying to be fair at all.</p>

                            <p>Before Covid I remember reading about how people in apparently highly desirable jobs were smearing faeces on the wall at work.  CE's were complaining about how their workers were eating their lunches in the toilet stalls and smearing faeces on the walls, and such.  Do you think that that kind of behavior is something that happens when people are in healthy office working environments?  People were f*cking miserable.  A lot of them.  The bullies love it, of course.  You can see them...  Poncing about the libraries at University 'all eyes on me!  all eyes on me!  all eyes on me!' like they've been trained in the private boarding schools to supervise the students below them in their afterschool study, or whatever, and they are used to lording it above the students just beneath them and if you don't like it they can cover your head with a bag and beat you.  That kind of a wonderful happy healthy workplace.  </p>

                            <p>You don't have to worry about the bullies taking your work output and running away with it claiming it as their own when the bullies can't see you working and take it from you.  You don't have to worry about people bullying you at lunch time etc so you need to hide on the toilet stall if you want any away from people time if you are working from home.  Unless the bullies are keeping you in their houses, of course.  Or cramped however many people to a bedroom to afford their rent in their rental properties.  You can see who the actual workers are when it comes to working from home.  Not everybody is a benign slacker like..  What's his name from "Silicon Valley".  The nice guy who failed his way up to VC of Stanford.  Benign happy to work from work guy.  Unlike the many toxic people who need to work from work because they don't actually do any work.  They thrive on beating on the younger ones.  Preventing and prohibiting the actual work from being done.</p>

                            <p>Where is the University of Waikato's research output?  Mind you, the AUstralian National University doesn't seem to be acknowledging ressearch output from it's studnets in more recent years.  In fact...  I don't see any evidence that any of their research students work was actually sent out for external examination at all.  Some people were credited as having done enough for PhD's and research was attributed to their name.  I'm not sure what evidence there is or was that it was primarily their own research output, at all.  Version control management software woudl make their own personal contributino to it clear.  And when it was produced as a measure of whether they were doing enough work.  Or whether it was about who was attending morning and afternoon tea.  Who was typing together.  And so on.  I guess there would be reports from external examiners if there were reports from external examiners...  Auckland says they own the reports and they don't give them to students.  That makes me wonder if Auckland has any external examiners reports at all, as well.  Nothign there hey.  What reseach output?  Waiting for the slackers to be fired.  Best case.  Die, worst case.  They reckon it will come down to over their dead bodies.  THey have tenture.  Jobs for htem for life.  So many other people can just f*cking die for all they care.  So they can f*cking slack and teach high school curriculum contents in the 'universities' to people who will die before they will say they've done enough for completion fo graduate research since the people on payroll to supervise are likely incapable of that level themselves.  That seems to be the pre-requisite for why they are hired.  Chris Whelan is..  Well, either too f*cking stupid to do the job of taking the complaint and hitting 'forward' so it goes to police / is scheduled for meeting of the NZVCC.  A computer could do a better job of it.  How much money would it cost to get someoen to write a f*cking script to hit 'forward' on the emails going in to his outbox?  He's on hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.  I jsut saved the governmetn.  You are welcome.  The problem isn't that there isn't enough money.  The problem is corruption.  Stupidity.  Corruption.  Stupidity.  Corruption.  The courts can't even spit ta f*cking judgment out 3 months post hearing.  F*cking corruption.</p>

                            <p>That is actually what they need to do in academia.  Use version control management software (e.g., have students do their work in Git and Github or whatever).  So that you can see who does the actual f*cking research work.  See who the workers are.  Pay your workers.  And so you can automate release dates.  When is the work due?  The deadline?  The version that there is on release date is the version that is released.  It's not that f*cking hard.  What is the hold up?  Too busy slacking...  All the f*cking slackers...</p>

                            <p>It takes the applications that have been received by the application deadline and it processes them according to academic merits.  A computer could be programmed to do it.  You don't need a meeting of slackers where each of them is paid hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to yakkity yak yak yak about how they aren't going to select students on the basis of academic merits and you can't make them.  It takes the enrolment start date (that was stated on the application that was recived by the application deadline) and it spits out a thesis submission date.  So that the project the student applied to be enrolled in can be completed in a timely fashion.  A computer could do it.  You don't need to pay people hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to call meeting after meeting after meeting after email after email refusing to accept that 1 year of work should be completable in 1 year.  A computer could do it.  All of the f*ckign slackers on payroll.  Automaton would be better.  What do the people on payroll do to help the work get completed to a high standard?  Do they do more or less than what a computer can do with a f*cking spell checker?  Automaton.  Why are they on hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to prevent and prohibit the timely production of research output?  THey may make lovely secondary school teachers of secondary school level content.  But they aren't producing any research.  They don't have research output.  Chris is typing..  Amy is typing.  Chris and Amy are typing..  Let's go to school so we can eat our lunch together.  Let's go to school so we can meet up for morning tea.  Let's have a meeting!  Let's put on our fancy suits and make sure there is no research output at all.  What University?  

                            <p>These toxic bullying government institutions of abuse...  Do you think the studnets are more or less likely to experience the abuse at it's worst if they are required to go in in person to in person meetings where they are called into meetings with no witnesses..  Or if they are working remotely or by distance.  I have posted on my website emails that various people from the Univesrity of Waikato have sent me.  Telling me I'm not allowed to complete  1 year of work in 1 year and so on.  I can tell you it is vastly worse in person when they call you in to tell you to your face (behind closed doors) how garbage you are and how there will only  be a job for you over their dead bodies etc etc.  We know I wrote my work myself (I didn't plagarise it or thieve it from someone else) because we have the version control software that the people on payroll pretend to be too f*cking stupid to use.  Where are the changes they suggested to my work?  What was their contribution to it?? What concrete changes did they provide?  Did they help the work be better or merely different?  THink of the increase in productivity, the increse in research output that would come out of f*cking firing their stupid arses (put them on disability if they are incapable, put them on unemployment if they would be better suited to a different kind of work..  Maybe teaching secondary students secondary student curriculum if they aren't willing or able to keep up a research output)..  Automaton would be more helpful than them.  They couldn't proof things for typos with a submission date that I informed them of months and months and months in advance.  The submission date should have been spat out the f*cking computer when I was enrolled by the f*cking computer after the f*ckign computer received my application to be enrolled by the application deadline.  They can't do it / they won't do it.  WHy the bloody hell are they on payroll when they don't have a research output?  How much research work do they do every year?  Nothing.  I tell you what...  There's nothing here.  F*cking freeriders.</p>

                            <p>What is the outcome of the investigation into the legality of the war over in the Ukraine?  Does it come down to who started it?  I think...  I am remembering reading an article that said that some people in the Ukraine shot down an airplane.  That was the start of things.  If that was true and right...  Whose airspace was the aircraft in when it was shot down?  Was it actually in Ukraine terrain else did Ukraine shoot down an aircraft outside of the Ukraine.  In a sort of 'the best defence is an offence' kind or sort of situation?  Well then who gave the order for them to shoot the plane down?  That's who started it.  Right?  How is the investigation coming along?  Now now..  A whole bunch of world leaders are invested in their being war in the Ukraine for a whole bunch of reasons.  NZ's interest will be in trying to muster a draft, if possible.  To ship as many NZers off to die as possible.  We don't get submarines, however.  We can't just sink them under the sea on their way out of NZ...  Just walk away from the women and children.  We've got them, don't worry about that...  Just hand over all your stuff and walk off to die, now, thanks very much.  Justice Toogood has decided he wants to keep being payrolled for another 40  years so we aren't going to pay you...  Thanks for all the unpaid slave work you did.  Time to die now.  Thanks.  Ta.  Go on Chris, see if you can muster international enthusiasm for a draft from NZ...  See if people will go off all voluntary-like from Secondary School.  See if you can ship the 18 year olds off in the name of unpaid internship so you can have the life you believe you are entitlted to (twice the life, right Justice Toogood?).  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>Bell Gully..  Thompkins Wake..  I forget who the University of Auckland payrolled to do their filings.  Both of those firms were hired by someone, though.  Was it Chris Whelan to defend his entitlement to write off every single complaint he has received as a 'personal problem' of the student instead of following the policy and procedure that he wrote to uphold NZs international obligation to protect whistleblowers.  Since, you know, we don't just want to curb and kill the *perception* of wrongdoing in NZ Universities..  We actually want to ensure that there isn't any serious wrongdoing going on.  No?  That's not his Statutory responsibility?  Actually his job is to ensure that NZ never meet any of our international obligations (what are they going to do about it?  Weather bomb us?  Hahahahaha you and whose army?  What are they going to do?)...  I guess he wouldnt' have been payrolled otherwise...</p>

                            <p>I wonder a bit what is going on in the world, internationally, in IT.  If they are paying the workers (now that they can identify the workers via version control management software) and the Slackers are all being let go..  Else if the children of the administration who were cheated into the Public Schools of California (when their parents could have full fee paid their way through Stanford) and the like... The boys can take sports scholarships to play on the women's team, or whatever... In the name of transgender equity the children of the administration can take up all the training places...  Are being payrolled to micromismanage the administration of the marketing team of Slackers or whatever...  The bloat.  Bloatware.  Hundreds of thousands of dollars to them to be payrolled until, finally, automaton.  Go DevOps...</p>

                            <p>  https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/131788981/can-one-less-student-make-a-difference-teachers-respond-to-smaller-classes  What?  You are going to actually acknowledge that certain people have completed their teacher training and you are actually going to payroll them to work as teachers?  God no.  That's now how it works.  You don't acknowledge that they have graduated and you record only ever increasing levels of debt against their name while you put them to work as unpaid student interns teachers aides teachers assistants while they pay the university they pay the university they pay the university they pay the university.  Paying teachers for having completed their teacher training?  That is not how we do.  There aren't enough teachers!  We will have to re-enrol and re-enrol and re-enrol and re-enrol people into teacher training (whether they apply to the programme or not -- right, Justice Toogood?  The University of Waikato can record that studnets (e.g., Kelly Roe) is enrolled in a program of study *even when the student never applied to be enrolled in that program of study*.  Send the bill to the IRD For student fees *for programmes of study that the student never even applied to be enrolled in*.  Right, Justice Toogood?  What education and training system...</p>

                            <p>  https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/300855134/god-help-us--waikato-hospital-short-40-nurses-for-one-shift  How many "healthcare assistants" were there?  How many students who were enrolled in nursing qualifications (who had been re-enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled in nursing qualifications because nobody is ever going to sign off on them having completed their nursing training) were in the hospital?  Nurses don't actually do any of the things that were mentioned in the article -- right?  Unpaid voluntary nursing students do those things in their role as "healthcare assistant" for low to no wages.  For decades..  Right?  You won't sign off on completion of their training because then they would leave.  Right?  Since you aren't going to pay them they would pack up and move someplace where they would be paid.  Australia, maybe.  Else (worst case) they would apply for paid work in NZ which would mean that some other nurses out there wouldn't get so much over-time.  Over-time pay.  And so on.  Wouldn't be such a small exclusive group anymore.  Wouldn't get to feel so...  Powerful.  It's a certain special type of power, I suppose.  Feeling like that's how valuable you are.  How scarce.  </p>

                            <p>That was something that many medical people say.  Those of them that were graduated, however many decades ago.  That they were very young indeed (early 20's) when they were graduated and shipped off to some rural community where they would be the only doctor in town.  Or sometimes some rural hospital where they may be the only doctor on during the night, or whatever.  So no supervision.  Just get in there and have a go.  And you make mistakes.  Of course you do.  And you have to live with that and those.  I guess many people burn out.  Those who don't burn out have come to terms with getting in there and having a go and so on.  And they are determined that insofar as they actually play a role in the training of the new generation they will be complicit in their crimes.  There is that, I suppose.  When various people have been..  YOu know..  NOt washing their hands properly for years.  Not getting informed consents.  Overmedicating their patients.  All those sorts or kinds of things.  THey will only sign off on a new generation who is similarly implicated.  They get them writing all about the atrocities they are required to perform during their training in their ethics class.  Don't they?  Documenting their own crimes...  To normalise it.  So the law courts can go 'this is just how we do.  This is the kiwi way.  Only game in town'.</p>

                        <p>I'm not entirely sure about the 'men wanting to be women' characterisation...  But I agree with everything prior to that 100 per cent.  I was really really surprised to learn that Serena Williams wouldn't even be in the top 100 for tennis if there wasn't a womens's division, specifically.  If women who have gone through puberty as male (with male associated changes to bone density and frame and muscle mass) are directly competing against women who have gone through puberty as female (with associated changes to the shape of the pelvis and movement of bones and menstrual cycles) then it won't be very long at all before the transgender women are winning everything and displacing the females. </p>

                        <p>Once upon a time in the history of women's sport it was hard to get enough competitors for a competiton.  Maybe it is still the case.  Difficult for there to be weight class matched boxing or MMA or women's weightlifting events etc.  I reckon transgender athletes are in a similar position where we don't have transgender classes, yet, so that transgender athletes can compete against each other.  Maybe one day develop even to the point of when people transitioned, or whatever.  Different divisions.  To make things fairer.  More inclusive.  More of an interesting competition because things are evently matched.  A fair fight.  Do we still like for things to be fair?  Unclear...  I thought NZ was about the underdog but the attitude we get about the All Blacks being the best and that's why we love them seems to attest to otherwise.  People don't have a problem with jumping on the bandwagon of supporting the obvious winner.  I guess compensation for being kicked around so many other aspects or areas of life.  Have to take what you can get.  Sigh...</p>

                        <p>It is kind of interesting how different sports have gone different ways on it.  I guess in athletics and swimming there is recognition that puberty is really important.  Guys get a dramatic increase in performance.  Women don't.  They get worse for a time.  Many women feel demoralised over the drop in performance and drop out of sport altogether.  It sucks when you aren't as streamlined anymore because of your new shape.  It sucks when your pelvic bones start moving around so you have core instability and can't handle or drive your legs properly anymore.  Traditional ways of dealing with it were to starve them and put them on the pill and so on and keep training them as deficient boys, as much as you can...  Times are starting to change..  But, yeah...  </p>

                        

                            <p>______</p>

                            <p>Landon Watt in his capacity as legal advisor, office of the vice chancellor, university of auckland, informs me by email that the university of auckland spend $86,318.50 (including disbursements and GST) to hire external legal counsel for Roe v University of Auckland legal proceedings.</p>

                            <p>In the first case management conference for the above proceeding, Ms Roe pointed out to the 2 judges who were present that the Univesrity of Auckland had missed a filing deadline and she requested that judgment proceed in their absense.  That would  have saved the Univesrity $86,318.50 in legal fees.  The Judges who were present chose to grant the University an extension of time so that they could employ external counsel.  That was supposedly or apprently in the interests of Justice, the courts decided.  The courts decided to schedule a half day proceeding so that the University could asssert it's right to throw away applications from domestic adults even though the education and training act declares domestic adults to be eligible by statute.  The University published selection criterion (full time GPA, UMAT / UCAT Score, interview score) but refused to offer Ms Roe a place (or not) on the basis of her rank order score.  They said she was 'ineligible to have applied' and simply threw her application away. That was so that they could preferentially select teenagers and record levels of university debt against their name since the teenagers are entitlted to a secondary level education for free until they turn 20.  NZ doesn't have an education and training system.  Not even trying to be fair.  NZ doesn't have a functioning judiciary.  Not even trying to be fair.  Ms Roe doesn't 'get a discount on the amount awarded against her for Ms Roe being technincally right'.  Ms Roe is technically right in a technical matter of the University's decision to refuse to enrol her being ultra vires.  They were required to apply their published selection algorithm to her application and offer her enrolment if (and only if) her rank order score was high enough for selection.  They aren't being fair in how they are deciding who to enrol or not.  I don't know how much money people like Dr Leeks pay to do anything anything anything they like in our hospitals etc.  I would imagine considerably more than $86,318.50.  But the University behaving ultra vires has been upheld by the court.  The courts have chosen to give teeth to the Univesrity acting ultra vires.  What University?  What health system?  What education and training system?  What judiciary?  There's nothing here.</p>

                            <p>I am currently unemployed.  If you have a position suitable for someone with my level of education (you can see that I did the work for various qualifications whereas various other people on payroll didn't do the work for which they are paid - most minimally getting my reseach work out to externals so that they can sign off on completion fo my research qualification in a timely fashion).  https://www.payscale.com/research/NZ/Degree=Philosophiae_Doctor_(PhD)/Salary  Apparently NZ just keeps on needing to payroll new people from overeas (and people from NZ who didn't enrol in or do the work for these qualification) because they simply refuse to acknowledge the people in NZ who did apply to do the work and who did do the work.  Where is my government payroll?  Where is it?  Where is my money?  I was prepared to re-invest in further education..  But the government can't comprehend.  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camps.  Where is my money?  Only language y'all understand.</p>
                    
                        <p>These webpages document research that I have done for various Universities of NZ, Australia, USA.  Masters theses (MA and MPhil) and Doctoral thesis (PhD).  Also various graduate level course-work and write-ups of conference and seminar proceedings.  Articles.  A book chapter (co-authored).
                        </p>

                        <p>Much of that work that was given to supervisors and university admninistration was never sent out for external examination.  Supervisors didn't get comments back to me and didn't get it out to externals if they were too busy else lazy to do their job supervising me, so that externals could make concrete suggestions for changes else sign off that I had done enough for the 1 year masters or the 3 year doctoral programme that I had applied to be enrolled in.  The Universities kept recording re-enrolment and collect more and more money for keeping me re-enrolled.  Kept collecting more work from me.  Kept recording me as being re-enrolled.  The Universities aren't allowing externals to sign off on completion of research degrees.</p>

                        <p>I returned to New Zealand thinking that it didn't matter so much if the Australian National University wasn't going to send my thesis out for external examination, because I wanted to study Medicine and apparently it is competitive selection on the basis of full time GPA, primarily.  I thought with a GPA of excess 8.0 (actually 8.6 according to University of Auckland published criterion on how they will calculate it for the purposes of selection to Medicine) I had a pretty good chance.  But turns out that they aren't making decisions on the basis of GPA, at all.  They declared me 'ineligible to have applied' and they refused to correctly enter my GPA into their selection algorithm and offer me a place in the MBChB programme (or not) on the basis of my rank order score.</p>

                        <p>This website documents various cases that I have brought before the courts of New Zealand, therefore.  Auckland and Otago are not selecting people to MBChB on the basis of their academic GPA.  They are throwing away applications from domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years (who are eligible, by statute) in order to expediate selection of teenagers.</p>

                        <p>The statutory law of NZ says that NZ citizens are entitled to a free secondary school education until the age of 20.  When they turn 20 they are eligible to be enrolled in the tertiary programme they have applied to.  But the Universities are throwing away applications from domestic adults so they can record levels of debt against the name of the teenagers.  Often enrolling teenagers in only secondary level courses (partiuclarly in maths and science subjects at University).  Taking them out of secondary schooling in order to record levels of debt against their name.  Throwing away applications from domestic adults.</p>

                        <p>New Zealand is presently hearing cases of abuse in state care.  Not only are the courts delaying, but nobody in NZ seems interested, at all, in the selection practices that, for example, make Dr Leeks (and people like him) the only game in town.  Justice was not done for me in the various cases I brought before the High Court.  The Judges made errors of law (e.g., ignoring the TEC stating that 120 points of study = 1 EFTS of work = 1 academic year of work = 34 weeks enrolment including study breaks and the examination period).  The judges made errors of fact (e.g., I was eligible for enrolment so the university was required to process my application for enrolment according to their published criterion for selection whereby my GPA for the purposes of selection for MBChB was 8.6).  Justice Toogood was even pulled out of retirement (which is not proper process for appointing a judge) so as to refuse to uphold justice.  He is unwilling or unable to comprehend that the TEC states the enrolment period associated with the EFTS that the student has applied to be enrolled in and that that regulates what the University is allowed to charge to the studnets IRD for student loans for fees for having the student enrolled for however many years.  New Zealand is not keeping Universities.  New Zealand is not even trying to have a health system.  Apparently our health system is 'competitive'.  What is the aim of the competition?  To unlawfully detain in conditions of torture more people than any other nation in the world?  Or to pat ourselves on the back that we are doing better than Tonga?  They are not even trying to be fair.</p>

                        <p>Justice was not done in the High Court.  The Court of Appeal stated they required tens of thousands of dollars for the cases to go through the court of appeal.  They stated that the cases were all entirely particular and personal against me and not matters of public interest at all.  It isn't a matter of public interest that NZ Universities are keeping false records of student enrolment and false records of IRD debt.  It isn't a matter of public interest that NZ Universities are not getting research students work out for external examination.  That NZ Universities are not allowing external examiners to sign off on timely completion of graduate student research work.  It isn't a matter of public interest that Chris Whelan has not processed a single complaint of wrongdoing that he has received since he took up his position as head of the NZVCC in 2014.  It isn't a matter of public interest that Otago and Auckland Universities are throwing away applications to Medicine from domestic adults in order to ensure that Dr Leeks and people like him are the only game in town.  The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal's decision that these were not matters of public interest and that tens of thousands of dollars were required to be paid to the courts since Justice was not upheld in the High Court because of Judges that were not appointed by proper process precisely for the occasion.  The Social Security Appeals of Authority heard a case in late October and they still have not delivered Judgement on the case that was heard.  The Minister of Justice and Minister of the Courts say that it would be against independence of the Judiciary for the Ministers to remind them on expectations for timely Judgment delivery.</p>

                        <p>New Zealand is not keeping Universities.  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camps.  They record levels of debt against graduate research studnets name for enrolment periods the student never applied to.  They refuse to get the work out to externals.  New Zealand does not have a functioning health system.  They won't process applications to enrol.  They won't acknowledge progression through training.  They won't graduate people who have met requirements for Degree Completions.  They blackbird for slaves, only.  Chris Whelan and the like blackbird for slaves, only.  For a competitive health system where the aim seems to be to get unpaid volunteers to re-enrol and re-enrol and re-enrol in further training to unlawfully imprison and wrongful death as many people as they can get away with.  It's sooooooo competitive.  There's nothing here.</p>

                        <p>Apparently Ashley Bloomfield was appointed Professor for University of Auckland.  He never applied to PhD, never did the work for one, doesn't have any research output.  Apparently the reason they aren't signing off on (or allowing externals to sign off on) new graduates is because there won't be jobs for anybody else.  They'll pull Justice Toogood out of retirement (after he's been payrolled for more than 40  years) rather than appointing a new Judge.  Must keep the social hierarchy.  Apparently there will be jobs for new people only over the dead bodies of these people who were given governmernt jobs for life.  Many of them with tenured positions in the Universities and they have little to no research output to show for all of the government payroll that they have had in their life.  What do they do?  5,000 words of research every year they are paid to research at the University?  How many of them who actually claim research output of their own simply bully their students into fleeing so they can pass their work off as their own?  Give it to external examiners (who do not return it to the student - signifying that they accept the research) and then the University won't acknowledge the student has completed the qualification.  So that down the track other people can pass the students work off as their own.  Corruption.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                        <p>In some instances they aren't even grading the students work properly.  For example, they intentionally market the Public Health Degree Programme as one that is intended for students with a strong background in subjects like Arts and Law.  Then they say that actually it's intended as a 'first in family' Degree whereby it is intended that the graduates will consider themselves lucky to have been allowed to go to University and complete a Degree, at all.  The students aren't expected to be (are failed for) working to internationally accepted standards of scholarship.  Their work won't be assessed on academic merits, at all.  The tutors can write the essays for them else they can copy paste together the lecturers powerpoint slides else they'll be failed for the courses.  Fail anybody who can't / won't output work indistinguishable from the outputs of a computer programme.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                        <p>How many Medical Students did Dr Leeks bully into fleeing?  How many applications to Medicine does Professor Glue throw away so that he can keep up his Glue Factory as the Only Game in Town?  Nobody else need apply.  Nobody else will be graduated.  All of the money for him into perpeptuity.  All of the payroll for him and people like him.  It's sooooo competitive, apparently.  All of the payroll for him until the day that he dies.  </p>

                        <p>New Zealand does not have psychiatry.  Punative institution of abuse.  Not even trying to be theraputic.  Punative.  Abuse.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                        <p>Look at the calibre of the lawyers the NZ Universities chose to hire to defend their entitlement to throw away applications, to throw away research work, to refuse to allow externals to sign off on qualification completions.  They choose to hire senior partners of major firms.  That's the kind of thing that guilty people do.  That's taxpayers dollars they chose to spend defending their entitlement to not follow the statutory laws of NZ.  The courts gave Auckland University extension on their filings when I do not miss a single filing deadline.  They did not file their initial defense on time.  I requested that the courts allow things to proceed in their absense, therefore, but the courts asserted that 'that is not how we do things'.  Right.  So the University of Auckland spent how much money on hiring a partner of Bell Gully, then?  How much in court costs arose because of the courts decision to grant the Univesrity of Auckland etension of time so that they could pay laywers?  The courts do not function.  I wonder if it is because the Univesrity isnt' enrolling, progressing, graduating people from Law School.  What education and training system?  There's nothing here.  What health system?  What judiciary?  What skilled work?  Ashley needs hundreds and hundreds of thousands of tax payers dollars to pass himself off as a Professor, now?  Quickly quickly quickly tell all the graduates of Harvard to come here to do their knock-out gene studies  because nobody will be (and nobody ever was) prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus.  Apparently people can't be prosecuted for anything at all since Meredith Connell has the monopoly on prosecution and they are conflicted out from all the people who put a dollar in their private pockets.  There's nothing here.  </p>

                        <p>It is in the Australian Constitution that NZ is a State of the Federation of Australia.  Australia refuses to acknowledge this, though.  Refuses to supply voting papers to NZers to vote in Federal elections.  Refuses to pay Australian wages.  Refuses to supply Australaian birth certificates and passports.  The only leaders that internatinoal community will acknowledge as the leaders of NZ are ones who run this nation as a prison slave detention camp.  Blackbirding for slaves.  There's nothing here.</p>

                        <p>The Ombudsman delays things only.  Takes more than 1 year.  Anything the Ombudsman decides is not binding anyway.  Apparently it is all very very particular and very very personal how much money the University of Auckland chose to spend asserting their legal entitlement to throw away applications from domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years so as to preferentially select teenagers - many of whom have not finished all of what secondary levels of education are supposed to be offering them for free, in NZ.  Defending their entitlement to select students to Law and Medicine and so on on the basis of whatver they want.  With no accountabiltiy at all.  But still the University has not supplied the information to me as to how  much money the Senior Partner of Bell Gully made off of the University's decision to assert their entitlelment in court.  Whether it was pro bono work that she did in exchange for them still acknowledging her as a graduate of their University, or what.  It doesn't matter what the Ombudsman says, therefore.  Even when mostly what the Obmudsman says is that he is incapable or unwilling of seeing any wrong, at all.  It was very very personal and particular against Ms Roe, apparently.  It isn't sysematic or systemic that his is how people are treated in NZ.  Each and every complaint that Chris Whelan has received since he took up his office in 2014 has been thrown away (systemically and systematically) on the grounds that he has deemed the complaints to be all cases that are very very partiuclar and very very personal against the particular studnet.  All 'relationship problems' between the student and the only game in town that the University will employ to take all the money for doing little to no actual research work of their own.  That's why they pay them, seems to be the case.  To be a bully.  Take all the money out.  Only game in town.  There will be a job for their student only over their dead body, they claim.  They aren't even going to retire (e.g, Justice Toogood).  Only over their dead bodies can there be payrolls for anybody else.  Only game in town.</p>

                        <p>
                            https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/488062/teaching-hospitals-need-to-do-more-to-educate-about-consent-study  'It also found there was also a need to better advertise to patients that they were entering a teaching hospital and medical students would be part of their medical team.'  But they would only be part of their medical team -- if the patient consented for medical students to be part of the medical team. Isn't that what informed consent means?  That once you have been informed of something (e.g., that there are medical students wanting to practice playing doctors and nurses with you) that you have the right to say 'no, I don't want medical students to be part of my medical team'.  But why would our 'health system' listen to what the patients want?  Only Dr Leeks 2.0 need apply.  Only the best candidates for the next him will have their applications to medical school processed, at all.  The students need to get better at explaining to the patients how they have been volunteered for the only option that they have, whether they like it or not.  What health system?  Government institution of abuse.  There's nothing there. 
                        </p>

                        <p>I applied to the ANU to do a PhD on informed consent and how Australasia doesn't seem to comprehend what it is.  To see how they would handle my application.  THey say that my application was 'incomplete' which is false.  Deny that I provided writing samples (you can see the writing samples for yourself on my writing page.  THey also had 3 writing samples on file for me already and a more than 100,000 word PhD that they never got out for external examination.  That's over on the writing page too in case you don't believe me.)  Interesting to see that they chose to falsely accuse me of an 'incomplete application' while subsequently funding was given to various other people to research informed consent.  I guess that's the point of collecting up research proposals.  So you can take the proposal and then give it to someone else.  Take my outputs and give them to someone else.  Pay other people hundreds of thousands of dollars for taking from me all of the work that I do.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                        <p>I guess the consoliation is that they will get sick one day and the special handpicked psychopaths can have their turn with them, then.  It's sooooooo competitive...  The supposed medical students who get in there and have a go at playing doctors and nurses without informing their patients of who they are, what they want to do, why they want to do it, what they will do with the results, what options the patient has..  THey will get sick.  Then their fellow medical student frenemies can practice on them.  Gnawing each others arms off it's soooooo competitive.  Only game in town.  What health system?  What education system?  There's nothing there.</p>
