                            <article>

                            <p>
                            This website documents some of the academic work that I did for New Zealand, Australian, and American Universities.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I have requested the Australian National University supply me with the documentation they have on what supervision Kim Sterelny and the Philosophy Programme of the Research School of Social Sciences offered me and explain why it was that they gave me extensions and yet refused to progress me through the qualification and refused to grant me my PhD.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I have documented, here the work that I did for the University of Waikato, subsequent to that where I wrote for them a 120 point MPhil Masters Thesis and they went on to refuse to get it to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit them signing off on completion of that Degree.  They went on to get it out late requesting it be examined for the wrong qualification (doctoral rather than masters examination so it would be found to be 'too short').  They refused to allow the overseas based external examiner to sign me off and they refused to schedule an oral examination when he asked for that after seeing they refused to sign me off themselves.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I have also documeted a similar process occurring in the Courts of New Zealand.  They do not accept filings, they will not progress filings, they order case management conferences where the Judges instruct filings to be changed into things that are less likely to win and they refuse to progress cases through the courts.  

                            <p>
                            Here are my submissions to the Court of Appeal regarding the University of Otago:

                                <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>.  I post them here because the Courts say I am out of time because I did not pay them $7,060 by the deadline they set.  I post them here so you can judge for yourself whether the courts have or have not upheld justice.  You need to bear in mind, with my work, that nobody helped me fix up the typos etc.  There is also a certain amount of resentment that I am having to the courts when they refuse to pay a trained lawyer to do the filings (I cannot find a legal-aid lawyer who will do the work).  I don't want my filings to look like the filings of a trained lawyer.  They don't pay me.  They don't pay me.  They don't pay me.  The courts are supposed to uphold justice and fairness.  I should not have to read the judges the law.
                                </p>

                                <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings on grounds that it had already passed judgment on the filings and would not revisit the issue.  They did not think my filings sufficient to show there had been a grotesque injustice.  I post them so you can judge for yourself.  
                                </p> 

                                <p>
                                 Here is why I believe that New Zealand is a State of Australia (it is written into the Australian Constitution): <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  They do not progress my submissions.
                                </p>  

                                <p>
                                The Universities of Otago and Auckland are not being fair as to how they are choosing what students to enrol in Medicine.  I have documented how Otago unlawfully discriminates against applicants on the basis of disability (they are blatant about that being what they are doing) and I have documented how Auckland refuses to apply their published algorithm to applications.  That means that Dr Leeks wasn't the product of a fair algorithm.  He was hand-picked for displaying the qualities they have chosen to value.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The Universities and courts have broken the social contract.  The Courts have chosen to set precedent that it will cost upwards of $20,000 to take a case against the Univesrity to the High COurt and the High Court will not uphold Justice.  
                                </p>

                                <p>New Zealand keeps detention / slave camps.  New Zealand is a state of Australia.  Australia chooses to supply New Zealand Dollars to New Zealanders to prevent them travelling domestically and to disguise how low the wages are kept in New Zealand.  They will not pay the teachers, police, nurses, etc.  They do not value the lives of New Zealanders.  They keep slave / dention camps.  They do not allow qualification progression and completion.  They are not fair in their allocation of training places.  They are not fair in their process of advertising (if they even do) or appointing people for paid jobs.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Dishonest people live there.  They lie to prospective migrants and then they don't pay them.  They arrange for them to be abused.  They don't honor their part of the contract.  They don't progress the work they don't acknowledge the work.  They are not supportive or encouraging.  They don't acknowledge people's humanity.  They don't see people.
                                </p>
                        

                                <p> I put in an application to do another PhD with the ANU.  When I applied I said I was not really interested in starting over, and was more interested in recieving credit for the work I had done for them already.  I wanted to study Medicine.  Only I wasn't sure if there was any Medicine because there isn't any respect, at all, for informed consent.  So, there aren't 'cervical examinations' there are 'sexual assaults' and there aren't 'surgeries' there are 'physical assaults' and so on.   Here is a link to what Sterelny had to say about the idea of me being credited with a PhD in Philosophy: <a href="judicial-review/kim.pdf" target="_self"> Not supportive. </a>  I guess things are sooooooooo competitive that the work I have published on this site is not even enough for a fully self-funded applicant to be accepted to even START a PhD.  Nasty piece of work.  There is a global shortage of psychiatrists and medical specialists but he won't even support me in training to do that.  And by support I mean for him to say something f*cking nice for a change.  Everybody is just waiting for him to die so that there can be a jobs for a few more people.  But it is just so f*cking mean-spirited for him to prefer me to be kept or held or detained as slave.  Because he thought a good job for me was house-sitting for him and listenting to  him hanging off of his every word and sing sing singing his praises.  I wasn't allowed to work independently.  At least they took the journal off of him so that he doesn't get all the submissions for that anymore.  I wonder how many people he bullied into quitting the field entirely so he could incorporate their work into his own or give it to his friends.  So he could stop.  Prevent.  Prohibit people from doing philosophy entirely.  How is what he does Philosophy at all?  He shuns the traditional subject matter of Philosophy and refuses to teach anybody any of it.  His sole job has been to train a new generation of researchers so let's see the training he provided to me when I was enrolled under him for my PhD.  Lets see why you pay him.  I could not abide by his nasty in-group out-group mentality.  Grow up.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I find myself thinking 'there is no excuse for threats of violence'.  But I also find myself wondering what options there are for students or employees or slaves or volunteers when people who have kept them working or studying do not honor terms and when the courts refuse to uphold the law.  It might be possible to escape.  1/4 of the population of New Zealand has fled.  I find myself thinking 'it's the brain drain' and I find myself thinking about the brain drain 'if you have any brains then you will flee far away from here'.  And I find myself then thinking about flocks of migrants who are treated horribly everywhere they go.  False promises of a better life and then being kept as second or third class citizens.  And I wonder why it is that those who are wronged should be forced to flee and why it is that those who are doing the wrongs should  be allowed to persist in their wrongs.  
                               </p>

                               <p>
                                The Education and Training Act 2020 and the Education Acts prior to that all stated that domestic adults who had attained the age of 20 years were eligible to  be enrolled in the programme they applied to.  They stated that teenagers (under the age of 20 years) were able to be enrolled by the University only if the University was satisfied that they were able to complete the course.  So, when we hear of a Univerity being satisfied enough that a teenager could complete the course so as to enrol them and take their money and we then hear of the University failing them for their course not only once, but two years in a row, then it really looks like the University has some explaining to do as to how it was that they could not pass the student.
                               </p>

                               <p>
                                The High Court of Dunedin did not see it that way because the Judges are themselves involved in this process of bullying and abusing those who have  been wronged.  They think their job is to help the powerful be more powerful.  They don't appear to have a sense or conception of justice, at all.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The University of Otago is not processing applications to enrol properly.  They are not grading properly, either.  The reason why Universities do not give students back their work alongside grading schedules is to hide and conceal the evidence of them grading students work differently from teh grading schedules.  Published class lists make up studnets and information (e.g., saying that a certain number of students in the class were given A+ grades when that is not possible on that assignment without cheating).  They ask impossible questions in multiple-choice sometiems where the only way you could get that correct is by luck or by someone having given you the arbitrary answer in advance. They do this so as to give hardworking and motivated students poor grades.  It is part of the bullying and abuse that they do to have studnets feel inferior.  It is not an education system or a training program in anything other than having students settle for low to no paid work.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                When there is no justice then what are you supposed to do?  You could flee...  But why should you?  I don't know who decided (New Zealand Government or the Government of somewhere else) that New Zealand would be an experiment in how to breed terrorists.  That seems to be what they are training people to be.  When they refuse to listen to or progress complaints.  When they insist on treating people unfairly.  When the judiciary fails to uphold justice.  When people get sick and tired of running away (or when Covid restrictions prevent people from fleeing so that people are required to stand up for themselves back home) then what do people have to do for things to change?  
                                </p>

                                <p>  Where is Stuart McCutcheon?
                                </p>

                                <p>  Why would Australian want to have Harlene Hayes over in Western Australia?  Is it about ensuring the miners (I don't know how many of them are former New Zealanders) don't have medical care.  Correlation does not prove causation and there isn't any such thing as occupational disease and there is no treatment for people we do not value.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                New Zealand refuses to train doctors.  So doctors come here from overseas looking for work.  There was the Orthopedics one.  He was here for 10 days before his wife (also a Doctor) was accused of murdering his children and his employer in conjunction with the courts detained his wife indefinately in the psych hospital as patient.  He fled.  There was the neurosurgeon one.  It wasn't about the money because the people of Dunedin had donated money so that he could be paid.  He trained for several years at Waikato, even, so as to demonstrate he could function in our unique environment and not just the lofty ivy tower of England.  But we refuse to acknowledge or pay him so he's forced to go away.  Then there was the anesthetist who was lost at sea.  I don't know how many studnet doctors or visiting doctors are killed on the roads each year.  It doesn't seem very safe to be a doctor in New Zealand.  Do not travel.  I suppose you would say.
                                </p>

                                <p>We need engineers, do we?  There's a shortage of that.  Well, then, I suppose we have the standard sort of curriculum teaching the standard sorts of things so that the people with motivation and capacity to do it can get on with doing the training for that...  We don't?  
                                </p>

                                <p>We seem to be more interested in keeping slaves than anything else.  I wrote to Chris Hipkins, already.  Let's be real, Chris, the squabble about the curriculum is really about whatever it is that you have to do so that someone cleans your toilet for you, for less than minimum wage, inter-generationally.  Right?  So the people will do anything anything anything John Key says for $25 or some amount of money that is easy for him to afford.  Right?  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                We would rather pay people from overseas to come here and participate in the slave owner bullying and abuse of the ruling class dynamic than train our own people to do the work.  Because there isn't the work.  Is there.  There isn't really any work being done.  There's just the bulling and abuse dynamics.
                                </p>

                                Computer chips.  Also, Australia does not have.
