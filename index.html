 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">

                           <p>Australasian Universities aren't functioning as Universities.  They aren't properly processing applications to enrol.  They aren't properly acknowledging progression through training.  They aren't employing people to supervise studnets, get their work out to external examiners, allow externals to sign the students off when their work is at the requisite standard.  They aren't graduating the studnets.  Keeping them re re re re re enrolled for more and more and more and more money for the University.  I've put some of my academic work up on this site.  I didn't start out overly or overtly political but they wouldn't process or progree my work.  I was supposed to just keep handing over more and more and more work, oh, and taking out more and more and more debt to the University so that they could have pay increases for themselves while they don't do the job for which they are paid.  I think the journals etc are just scams, basically.  Indefinately hold up publication until the people are bullied into leaving so they can reattribute authorship to people on payroll.  I don't know that the people they chose to say graduates had their theses externally examined or if they paid bribes or whatever to the University in exhange for them saying they'd done enough for their qualification completion.</p>

                           <p>Australasia doesn't really seem to have functioning or functional health system, education system, judiciary.  They didn't enrol, acknowledge progression through training, graduate, employ people willing and or able to do those kinds of jobs.  There doesn't really seem to be anything there.</p>

                           <p>The Australian Constitution says that NZ is a State of Australia.  It is named a State of Australia.  The second original state after NSW.  But Australia won't give Australian passports or birth certificates to people who were born in NZ.  Won't process applications for enrolment in certain qualifications. Won't supply federal voting papers.  Won't process applications for certain government jobs.  Who arranges for New Zealand Currency to be printed in...  Canada?  To disguise just how low NZ wages are kept.  To prevent travel and the like.  New Manus Island.  Prison camp.  Detention camp.  Keeping slaves.  Treating the students as their property.  More and more and more and more money for more and more and more enrolment.  Not doing the job for which they are paid.  I guess the reason why they pay CHris Whelan hundreds of thousands of dollars per year is because he has the statutory function of processing complaints of wrongdoing.  He has used his position to refuse to process any complaints of wrongdoing.  Una Jagose has used her position to obstruct justice and order evidence to be hidden and thrown away (her role in the abuse in NZ government care inquiry).  Reappointing retired judges back on payroll so they can see nothing wrong (Justice Toogood was recently appointed not by proper process).  Not even trying to do any of the things they are on payroll to do.  Seemingly on payroll precisely only because they are unwilling and or unable to do any of the things they are supposedly paid to do.  Upside down stupid-f*cking land.</p>
