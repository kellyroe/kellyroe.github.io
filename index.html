                            <article>

                                <p>We are apparently supposed to believe that this guy has mad skillz such that he was able to forge a working barcode on a University of Auckland Student Identification Card. 

                                https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/middlemore-hospital-impostor-doctor-pleads-guilty-to-forging-document/JCAC2D3J3SJJRN63P2H4PC2RKQ/ 



                                  No?  They didn't have Student Identification Barcode Scanners in the Cadavar Dissection Lab.  When I was at Auckland they were scanning student barcodes on LECTURE THEATRES and ALL LABORATORIES.  I mean, you can't observe water, at the University of Auckland, without a working barcode.  Trust me, they are ensuring that you have paid your fees (and then some) in order for you to even be allowed on campus.  We are supposed to  believe he forged himself a Student Identification Number (present on the student id) and the Student Idenficiation Number that he forged for  himself on his Student Identification Card happened to match a Student Identification Number on the Roll for that class.  How many students is it to a Cadaver?  Is it 6 these days?  The group did not notice that their group had an extra student in it?  The tutor did not notice?  I mean, it defies credibility and it defies plausibility.  The most likely explanation is that this guy said or did something the Univesrity Administration or Governmetn did not like so they have decided to imprison him (like Brian Tamaki).  It isn't plausible, at all, that he fake himself a working Identification Card student number.  I think anybody who has done first year Health Science at the University of Auckland will know full well that this story defies credability.  What did he say or do?  He told someone with fibrosis of the lung that they needed to get an imaging scan.  What a crime.  We don't have radiologists, you see.  Apparently the Government was paying the radiation oncology people (radiate people on instructions from management?) thinking that they were Medical Doctors and thinking that they were Radiologists.  That sort of defies credability, also, honestly.
                                </p>

                                <p>I find it funny (strange, not funny haha) that the Dean of the School of Research, University of Waikato would instruct me to look deeply into her eyes and..  What?  Beg and plead for her to send my thesis out to external examiners...  Like she is paid to do...  To take the thesis from the student and post it out to the external examiners with instructions for them to examine it, in accordance with University regulations, for the Degree the student had applied, by the deadline, to be enrolled in...  She wants me to look her in the eyes, apparently, and say anything anything anything anything anything anything anything...  That will suitably motivate and incentivise her do, uh...  Do the f*cking job, for which she is paid.  I said to her 'is that what you want from your Medical Doctors?  You want them to look you in the eyes and say anything anything anything anything anything...'  Apparently so.  That is the standard or quality of healthcare that she wants, that she desires, for herself.  Not only herself -- but for everybody else.  Apparently the University of Waikato wants a Medical Training Programme so that the University administration can teach the students a little lesson or two in saying or doing anything anything anything anything anything the University Administration says...  The Waikato Hostpial is about the biggest Hostpial in Australasia.  They (for the most part) refuse to employ NZ trained Medical Doctors because, uh, there aren't any.  They find that people from developing nations overseas are more inclined to do anything anything anything the administration says (without pay). Go figure.
                                </p>

                            <p>The alliance between North America (USA and Canada) England (UK) and Australasia was, I thought, one that was based on things like democracy and rule by law.  Australasia refuses to be rule by law, however, things are too corrupt in these parts.  The Australasian Government seems to be choosing to keep a series or system of detention camps where the Justice, Education, and Health systems are used as tools of oppression against the people.  This website documents how the Tertiary Education System of Australasia refuses to train workers, refuses to sign off on completion of the training, refuses to grant qualifications to all (and only) the people who have meet requirements for the qualification, refuses to follow fair selection processes or their own published regulations when it comes to selecting which studnets to enrol, refuses to get supervised work out to external examiners in  timely fashion.  The Universities think their job is to keep detention camps where the studnets pay the University and / or the Government pays the University for detaining the student.  This feeds in to how the Judiciary refuses to uphold the laws.  The Judiciary seems to function as a tool of oppression against the people.  The Judicial Review page shows how the appointed judges (or judges pulled out of retirement who weren't even appointed properly) refuse to uphold justice.  They deny half the laws.  They deny the evidnece that has been put before them.  I have also documented how the Health System also is a tool against the people.  They are not processing applications to medicine properly.  They are not signing off on completion of training.  They put the Medical Students to work passing themselves off as Junior Doctors or Training Specialists or Consultant Specialists when they have not met requirements or when they have met requirements they deny them the qualifications and the training places and the supervision and the pay checks.  They have people kept in conditions of torture in the name of 'prisons' and 'psychiatric detention' and 'education schooling' and 'aged care' and it is just a system of detention camps up and down the land.  The Governments won't pay for the provision of social services (won't pay people to be doctors, teachers, lawyers, judges) and the like.  Not unless they are punative bullies and abusers.  Brian Tamaki gets locked up in Mt Eden because they don't want to hear how they are keeping detention camps.  Dr Leeks get to be placed in charge of selection, training, and sign off on Psychiatrists in New Zealand and Australia.  What you have to do in order to get a reference to be employed for a 'Social Services' job in Education, Health, Justice, in Austalasia.  There isn't anything here...  
                            </p>

                            <p>I have lodged a complaint with the Vice Chancellor of the Australian National University about them not processing applications to enrol properly (they say they decline my application on grounds they refuse to accept that anything on my writing page constitutes a 'writing sample' and they say that they do not have anybody willing or able to supervise research at that University).  The Vice Chancellor instructs me to re-write my complaint again and again (to 2 different Deans) and they say that I need to re-write my complaint again and again and again and again...  They simply refuse to acknowledge that they have received any complaints.  This is what Chris Whelan of the New Zealand Vice Chancellor's Committee was appointed to do.  When he isn't  blackbirding for student slaves in Vietnam or Brazil or Malaysia he is writing how he has recived precisely no complaints of wrongdoing about any of the Universities of New Zealand.  When AUT chooses to enrol a 14 year old girl in a Finance Degree (when 16 is the minimum age for University enrolment and when the Education Act states that Domestic Adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible to be enrolled in programmes they have applied to --  but the Universities withhold applications and choose to use discretion they believe they have to enrol teenagers).  When there are media reports of studnets claiming to have been sexually abused or used by supervisors before being deported without their qualifications (with or without a period of being drugged and detained in teh name of psychiatry services) Chris Whelan, apparently, has received no complaints.  When at least 1 person is found to be enrolled in the University, paying fees to the University, paying accommodation costs to the University -- while being dead for over 1 month.  Chris Whelan has recived no complaints at all about any of the New Zealand Universities.  Except for mine.  And the Judge pulled out of retirement to see no wrong writes that Chris Whelan would be behaving unlawfully if he performed his statutory function and actually Chris Whelan was appointed only to ensure that New Zealand would achieve 'lowest rate of perceived corruption' by being so corrupt as to pay him more than $200,000 per year to write only how he has never received a single complaint about wrongdoing from any of the Universities of New Zealand.  Where are all the theses?  For all teh studnets that the Unviersities of New Zealand say they have enrolled in graduate studnet research qualifications?  Where are they, then?  The Edcuation Act states that research is required to be the primary function of Universities.  Where is all the research, then?  Where is the research output of the studnets and the faculty?  Where are the journals?  Where are the books?  Where are the PhD theses and the enrolment dates associated with the production of the documents?  A PhD is supposed to take 3 years (extendible to 4 because it could take up to 1 year for the external examination process to work through).  Australasia seems only interested in keeping people unlawfully detained -- many of them won't get their PhD's until or unless they are literally dead so the Governmetn will never pay them.  Worse, many of them won't get their undergraduate Degrees until they are literally dead.  Worse, look at the people the Government chooses to acknowledge.  Dr Leeks gets hand-picked to select and train and graduate people as Psychiatrists.  To keep the instititions where we can put people when it looks like they have the willingness and ability to get their f*cking work done in a timely fashion.  Australasia cannot claim to have Universities.  Hospitals.  Judiciary.  There's nothing here.
                            </p>

                            <p>The Australian National University is not willing and / or able to supervise graduate research in philosophy.  They tell me they did not receive my research proposal (for any topic) from me, but there is no supervision available in the Philosophy Programme for 2022.  So, I suppose they didn't have any Philosophy students starting their PhD in 2022.  Else, they intend to refuse to provide supervision to those students.  They are done pretending to offer supervision to me.  Time to scammy scam some younger ones.  They like 'em young for the party party parties, you see.  I provided a research proposal to my former supervisor (who previously judged my work to be very good and expressed willingness to supervise me on a topic of his choosing) but they don't acknowledge the research proposal and he refuses to be a referee.  What kind of `employer' or `supervisor' refuses to write their employee or student a reference?  One that doesn't want to pay them and (more importantly) doesn't want anybody else to pay them either.  I think you have to be a violent sexual offender to get a reference, these days.   
                            </p>

                            <p>The writing page shows a 100,000 words + thesis that I provided to my supervisor, Kim Sterelny on the topic of his choosing.  More than 10 years ago...  He still hasn't given me any concrete comments on it as to what I need to do before I should get it to the external examiners.  He hasn't told me that he has read it, yet.  He also hasn't told me that if I want to get a thesis to externals then it is despite him or in spite of him and not at all because of him.  Does it look to you like he helped me with the thesis?  He chose the topic for me.  The evolutionary aspect to cognitive breakdown.  I didn't really see how viewing the phenemonon as evolutionary (or as a matter of breakdown) was particularly useful or helpful.  But it was a topic of his choosing.  A topic he was apparently willing to supervise me on.  So, where is evidence of his helping, then?  Does it look like a thesis that was produced under Sterelny's supervision?  What do they pay him for?  All the teaching that he does?  No?  Waiting on you, Sterelny.  Any time you are ready to unpack your stuff and get to work. The job for which you are paid.  My ANU student records are full of people in the Philosophy Programme saying that they should get more money from the government to keep me enrolled as student.  They say that my progress as student is just fine.  Nearly a full draft.  A full draft.  They expect me to submit by a certain date.  But they never get the work that I have given them to the examiners and there won't be evience of them having helped me with it in their email outboxes.
                            </p>

                            <p>Here is a question for you.  Is a student supposed to write the thesis and then softbind the thesis and then submit the thesis for external examination to a timeline.  For example, if it is reasonable to expect to take 1 year for external examination (3 months followed by 6 months changes followed by 3 months external examination for a total of 12 months of examination) then submitting a 3 year PhD thesis at the end of the second year would be the way to go.  Or, is the student supposed to work to a timeline set by their supervisor where their supervisor tells them when they are ready to submit the thesis?  Are you supposed to get your supervisor nice and drunk and get them to sign off on your submission date in that way 'by agreement'?  How is it supposed to go, exactly?  What if your supervisor just says 'keeeeeeep working'?  
                            </p>

                            <p>Supervisors have (one would suppose of a premier research university like the Australian National University) had experience with supervising before.  So they have supervised PhD students before.  So they have some idea of how long various things take and some idea of a realistic timeline to completion.  But the PhD student has, typically, standardly usually, not written or worked on or submitted a PhD before.  Who is being employed to  help who?  Or is the job to prevent and prohibit and obstruct.  Maybe the student only gets their PhD when they kill their supervisor.  Maybe that is the idea.  Because it's soooooooooo competitive.  The supervisors go gunning for their students.  That's the nature of the competition.  Divide and conquer.  Here are the special students (set up as targets only to be hated by the other students).  Create dissent.  Division.  All very...  Motivational and inspirational.  Don't you want to join them?  Party party party.  There's nothing wrong with a good party...  But there is something wrong with being expected to party with your boss or your supervisor partiuclarly when they are not being professional with their professional duties or obligations when it comes to processing or progressing or assessing or helping you improve your work performance.  Telling you timeline information.  Who wants to party party party with Des?  18 year old applicants to medicine?  I'm sure there is a brilliant 14 year old out there who will do anything anything anything anything it's sooooooo competitive.  That is the concern about the party party party situation.  And that is the nature of the competition.  It must be soooooooo competitive such that they will do anything anything anything anything anything.  Just following orders, you see.  Anything anything anything.
                            </p>

                            <p>No?  Well..  Leave then.  Just drop all of your stuff.  Just  hand it over.  Give it to us.  Then turn and walk away.  Or curl up and die.  Whatever.  Thanks for playing.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Chloe says that education is a poverty trap -- but she doesn't know what education is.  Education is not a poverty trap.  Education is not a social mobiliser, either.  Education is learning about the world.  Teacher and supervisors are supposed to help the students.  They are supposed to have more knowledge and more experience then them so that they are in the position (knowledge-wise) to help them.  They are supposed to have the motivation and desire to help them.  They are paid to help them.  We don't have education in New Zealand.  We won't pay people to do that.  We pay people to prevent and prohibit people with the willingness and ability to do the job from doing the job.  We have a system of slave or prison or detention camps with the aim or goal of preventing and prohibiting social mobility.  We don't have an education system.  If you learn to read, write, do arithmetic.  Do calculus.  Learn Medicine.  It's all despite of or in spite of our 'education' institutions.  There's nothing there.  There's nobody home.  They wouldn't pay anybody to do the actual job.  The actual work.  There's just a bunch of people trying to keep slaves detained indefinately while teaching them nothing and not allowing them to do any work to the best of their ability to prevent and prohibit and obstruct that too.  It's soooo competitive.  The slaves will do anything anything anything.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            They won't pay anyone to work clinical jobs.  You pay the university or the polytech training system (they are still working on setting it up) so that the slave worker students will be put to work and the slave worker students will pay the university they will pay the university they will pay the university they will pay.  They will never stop paying.  They will never stop paying the university.  And the university (or the polytech) will put them to work in the name of their training programme.  And not write them references for the work that they have done.  Will bully them and tell them that they are incompetent and inept and they don't know anything.  Will say that this one or that one is special (so the other ones will turn against them because it's soooooooooooo competitive).  And they won't pay the doctors or the nurses or the teachers or the sterile supply technicians or anybody anybody anybody at all.  Unless you want to be one of them.  Of course.  Don't you want to be one of them?  Ensuring that there aren't any teachers or doctors or nurses or sterile supply tecnicians.  No lawyers.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing at all.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            We do pay high taxes in New Zealand.  It has been with the expectation of social services.  But the Government will not pay people to provide social services.  They won't pay the teachers or the doctors or the nurses or the sterile supply technicians.  You pay the university or the polytech system.  They refuse to sign off on your workplace internship completion.  They say you have to keep working your internship just keep doing your internship.  Just keep paying the university and also doing the work you pay your employer.  Didn't you know?  That's what work is or what work means.  You pay the university because they are your employer.  You are a student and whistleblower protections don't apply to students because they are not employers there are no employment laws for the slaves that are detained by the universities and training system that makes people pay only.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The government wants people to comply in this, that, and the other respect.  To sign off that this, that, and the other building is safe (e.g., not an earthquake risk, not a fire hazard) so that insurance companies will bear at least some of the cost of the rebuild.  And the like.  The government wants people to do what they are told when they are told because they are told.  The judges.  I would suppose.  Brian Tamaki needs to be in Mt Eden but Dr Leeks needs to go train some more students in Melbourne.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            All of the power and none of the accountability.  Nobody can function.  One of the most under-developed economies in the world.  Corruption.  They won't pay the workers.  And where does all the money go, then?  Who is getting all the money on the payroll?  People who refuse to perform their statutory functions.  Chris Whelan, still.  Refusing to process or progress any complaints of serious wrong-doing against the Universities of New Zealand.  He won't do it.  Will not do it.  I was confused a bit because OIA request from me said that he did not fly anywhere on the taxpayers dime.  But I was sure he was off blackbirding for studnets very regularly in South America and Vietnam and the like.  I suppose those trips are unrelated.  Do do remember reading abuot a...  14 year old finance graduate from AUT...  I suppose the 'minimum age' laws on Tertiary Education (16 since that is the age for consent and party party party we all know how you gotta love 'dem parties with the admin in order to have the possibility of a place at all).  I thought that was why the Auckland VC's University provided house had rooms for a basement-slave.  Party party party.  It's soooooooo competitive.  The kiddies will do anything anything anything anything anything.  Right?  That's the nature of the competition and why it is that the people with power are determined to make everything a great competition.
                            </p>


                            <p>The Tertiary Education Commission defines a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  
                            <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a>.  The writing tab shows that the University acknowledged having received my application to enrol in a 120 point MPhil with 05 March 2018 start date by their prescribed deadline.  The TEC approved the qualification as being 'right sized'.  They have the statutory function of approving qualifications and checking that the enrolment period (34 weeks) matches the FTE EFTS (1) also the points value (120).  But the University of Waikato is keeping records showing that they are not billing students in this manner, at all.  They have had every opportunity to correct their records and they refuse.  They instructed me to take them to court if I had a problem with their practices.  The courts have, thus far, refused to uphold justice.  International and domestic community need to be warned that they are lacking in honesty and integrity.  They are interested in closing ranks around their wrongs.  New Zealand isn't lacking skilled workforce or labor, at all.  New Zealand is a nasty little despot where the people with power refuse to allow other people to function.  Hostages.
                            </p>


                            <p>Here is how much the Inland Revenue now says I owe the New Zealand Government for my 'Education' and 'Training' that are not acknowledged because New Zealand qualifications apparently expire 5 years post-graduation (well, not the Judges law degrees, apparently, but my qualifications have expired): 
                            <a href="judicial-review/ird-shot.pdf" target="_self"> $104,663.</a>  You can see, then, that New Zealand does not appear to have functioning Universities, they appear to have detention or forced labor camps.  They won't progress or process academic work (particularly research).  They refuse to get official documents (theses submitted for examination) to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit external examiners signing off on qualification completions.  There is no skilled labor workforce, in New Zealand, because New Zealand has a series or system of forced labor detention camps only.  You pay the University you pay the University you pay the University you pay the University.  Maybe they put you to work as an actor playing the part of a skilled professional.  Then, when you are done paying them, your qualifications are withheld.  
                            </p>

                            
                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  They aren't progressing the filings. They are refusing to supply applications, refusing to process applications on their academic merits.  Apparently it isn't a matter of public interest how they pick and choose people to pass themsleves off as 'doctors' in our hospitals.
                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  Demanding me to pay more and more and more money to the courts else they force all my cases aborted, or abandoned.  <a href="judicial-review/sc-eyes.pdf" target="_self"> Here is the Judgement of the Supreme Court that I am attempting to appeal on the grounds that it is manifestly grotesquely unjust. </a>  It is like they have their eyes poked out.  Our highest court does not seem to have the conception of justice, at all.  It was the courts decision to delay Roe v University of Waikato proceedings until AFTER Roe v NZVCC and also until AFTER Roe v University of Auckland.  The Judge for Roe v NZVCC made all kinds of pronouncement in his judgment on the matter of Roe v University of Waikato.  That is to say instead of judging the issue he was supposed to be judging (the inaction of Chris Whelan in his capacity as CE of the NZVCC) he thought he would weigh in on whether or not I had done enough for completion of the MPhil Degree.  Clearly that is a matter of the Judge of a different case to decide!  
                            </p> 

                            <p>
                             <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  The Australian Constitution clearly names New Zealand as a state of Australia.  They say that they don't have to honor the constitution because New Zealand officials did not turn up to various things and they did not consent.  I don't know why Australia would care about consent in that instance.  Did they care about the consent of the Aboriginal people of Australia?  Did they care about consent of people to be immunised or subject to medical treatments or experimentation?  If they want to change the constitution then there is a process for it to be changed.  I think it involves a vote.  But New Zealanders don't get to vote so the Australian Government clearly does not care whether or not the people of New Zealand consent.  New Zealand functions as a detention camp of Australia.  But then, Australia still seems to govern like it is a detention camp of the Northern Hemisphere, so...
                            </p>

                            <p>Here are  <a href="judicial-review/sup-court-waikato.pdf" target="_self"> My Filings </a>to the Supreme Court regarding the University of Waikato    
                            </p>

                            <p>Una Jagose doesn't seem to have the job of instructing Crown Law to prosecute corruption within New Zealand Universities, or within the Judiciary (where judges refuse to accept evidence and where the supreme court punishes people for bringing injustices before the courts).  I suppose that is why they pay her more than half a million dollars to do that job.  They pay her to ensure the job is not done by anyone.  Not by her and not by anybody else.  The fact she is in the job prevents and prohibits the job being filled  by anyone with the willingness and ability to do the job.  It seems there is no evidence that they will accept that would attest to corruption.  None of the invoicing information that I provided (e.g., 0.5 EFTS = 120 points = 60 points = indefinate enrolment).  New Zealand does not appear to have a functioning judiciary.    <p> <a href="judicial-review/crown-law.pdf" target="_self"> Blow off response. </a>  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            <a href="judicial-review/adhbinterlocutory.pdf" target="_self"> My request for permission from the High Court to appeal their decision to award costs against me with respect to the ADHB having chosen to file motion to have my proceedings struck out rather than the ADHB having chosen to stop with involuntarily detaining people in conditions likey amounting to torture. </a>  That sounds confusing.  It all starts to sound confusing, doesn't it.  The gaslighting garbage output nonsense nonsene nonsense from the courts.  Denying the evidence.  Refusing to acknowledge the half of the laws that speak to the duties and responsiblities and actual job descriptions of the various government departments (e.g, the NZVCC and various of the Universities).  
                            </p>

                            <p>Australia now seems to have a case of the 'meeeeeeee toooooooooos'.  The 'metoo' in this part of the world is when the leadership sees a practice that is more depraved and deprivation inducing than the ones they currently have and they aspire to go even lower than lower than low.  They get all motivated and inspired at just how bad things can be..  And nothing will happen.  Right?  There will be no consequences.  Right?  Because it's hell on earth.  Right?  All the work that they do to bring it to  be.  Sooooooooooo competitive.  No education.  No justice.  No meaning.  No value.  Nothing.  Just a bunch of zombies following orders.  Which is fine.  No conscience.  When I grow up I want to be a...  Sophist.  No?  Psychopath?  Wrongful deathbringer?  Pedophile in the schools?  Sooooooo competitive...
                            </p>

                            <p>I don't see the pretty 14 year old girls turning up to play 'flight attendant' in the 'job fairs'.  But we see the face of unemployment, in NZ.  Oooooh no, the people turning up for the job fares already have jobs.  They are just looking for better offers.  And the people paid to do the deciding, well they don't see 14 year old girls to abuse.  So...  Bring on the cheap migrant slaves.  C'mon other countries.  You gotta have pretty young things you want to (effectively) sentance to death.  Right?  We will give them a 'job' in NZ.  Renowned the world over for fair wages for fair work (not).  Oh please sell your child into slavery to the NZ government.  We want someone to clean Chris Hipkins (minister of everything's) toilet.  Intergenerationally.  For less than minium wage.  Get a student to do it, right Chris?  The generations 50++ year PhD in cleaning your toilet for they pay the New Zealand Education System to do their 'workplace internship' in cleaning your toilet.  Intergenerationally.  For less than minimun wage.  No recourse for complaints.  Only a 'student' -- right?  Not even an employee.  A what now?  Don't you know how many generations of slavery are required for so much as minimum wage in New Zealand?  I mean...  People must be, like, 50 years +++ behind Chris Hipkins.  Who wears his intelligence and administration skills etc etc upon his sleeve.  Because they count the votes (yeah right).  When so many are kept in government institutions without so much as a post office box to their name.  Yeah, right.  All the work that goes into the prevention and prohibition of development...  The Harry Harlow Island Based Research Program.  They sold out the health of their people for what, now?  That's why we keep them the way that we do.  Of course.  All the honors and awards for the most esteemed Jacinda Ardern.  Her con-munications Degree from Waikato.  Then her PhD from Harvard in exchange for informing the graduating class how they were welcome to harvest their designer baby inplants from NZ without criminal sanctions.  Come get your designer babies.  The most designer baby of all being Angleman Syndrome Baby, of course, who (with the help of a little horse tranquiliser) will never  be able to object, protet, or complain how you choose to sexually and physically and psychologically abuse and torture them.  Of course.  The aim or purpose of Medicine.  To drug the non-consenting.  Because they have been consented.  What part of that is difficult?  The government decides what you voluntarily do.  From your education to your employment to your death.  Right?  Of course.  I mean, who did you think was the boss of you outside your workng hours.  Your what, now?  Party party party.  Who wants to party?  Anything anything anything it's soooooooooooooo competitive....  Yawn.
                            </p>

                            <p>So the governments have this idea of terrorist bombing graduations.  That's a good idea.  That way you will never have to pay them wages for doing skilled work.  Instead of people complaining about the university refusing to give them the qualifications they have met the requirements for, instead of people complaining about them refusing to publiclly advertise jobs, refusing to hire people for jobs they insist upon keeping vacant else only filling with violent offenders, the people can just die in a terrorist attack, then.  Else maybe the New Zealand government can send them off to 'fight for Ukraine' by which I mean dump them on Russian soil in the hope that the Russian Government will be blamed for their ill treatment and untimely death.  The Medical Students staying at Carrington College get to walk through the memorial every morning on their way into Medical School.  It's been carefully placed to be a constant reminder to them of what will happen to them if they object to anything the Government chooses to do.  The Government decides what you have voluntarily consented.  You have been voluntarily consented.  What part of that is hard to understand.  You lose, people of New Zealand.  People of Australasia.  All of the tax money and none of the social services.  The Government is the major employer (pretty much everything else was forced by the Government into bankruptcy with unlawful lock-down policies enforced by the police and New Zealand gangs working togethr to ensure the logistics of drug supply etc up and down the country).  We aren't even pretending to be a  nation that is even trying even a little  bit to be rule  by law. The laws are grotesquely inadequate and even when they aren't nobody cares what they say because they aren't inforced, at all.  Australia has decided that they don't care whether or not Aborginal people are written into the constitution.  New Zealand is written into the constitution.  How is that upheld?  Well, then.  It's all just a waste of time.  Completely and utterly.  The worse things are for the people of a country the better the leaders feel about themselves.  Didn't you know?  The prevention and prohibition of development.  Shortland street always was a Government Propaganda programme designed for people overseas to watch.  It was to help us blackbird for a constant supply of 'workers' who would arrive here only to discover that we would not acknowledge their qualifications, we would not sign off on new qualifications, we would not pay them, we would not pay them, we would not pay them, we would not pay them, they are to pay us for the cost of their 'training'.  But there is no supervision and there are no qualifications.  The Government will arrange a terrorist bombing of graduation else drafting to die on foreign lands.  Deportation.  Untimly death.  The government will not pay the workers.  Will not pay the workers.  You pay the government.  You pay the government.   You need to apply for a visa.   You need a new medical exam.   The doctors on payroll are to write reports for expulsion only.  Never stop paying.  Never stop paying.  Never stop paying the New Zealand government.  Never stop.  What's that?  Time to stop paying?  Why, then, it's time for you to go away.  Thanks for playing.  How many children hostages did you leave us?
                            </p>

                            <p>'In the name of cancer-care'.  I suppose that's a way to get rid of people.  Radiation oncology.  You could prescribe to people high doses of protease pump inhibitors.  That will reduce the amount of acid being produced in their stomach.  Then you could give them some kind of a nerve block to immobilise them.  Maybe from the neck down.  You could radition treatment their esophagus.  Esophageal spincter.  Then you could suddenly stop the ant-acid medication so they get a rebound syndrome.  All of a sudden they will be producing a lot of acid and with a weakened sphincter and having been immobilised I guess they will die in their acid secretions.  That would be a way to get people.  Quite a lot you could do with radiation oncology.  In conjunction with a few other things.  That's the aim or the goal or the purpose or point of the population control strategies that there are in public medicine or public health, in New Zealand?  No?  Yes?  Just following orders.  Of course.  From the way the patients are triaged on the basis of their home address and GP details and whatever the government has in their notes on them.  Maybe it is in their notes tha the government raised them as a Fisher and Paykel inubator baby where they kept them, like in one of those old Russian Orphanages where they weren't touched by humans to try and induce attachment disorders and the like.  So everyone can learn that they have been hand-picked chosen by the Government to be all special raised to be part of a gang with the party party party party party drug shipments.  That kind of a thing.  It's not plausible to think that we need to spend the next however many generations repeating all the inhuman and inhumane research experiments etc etc that were only ever poor, thin, weak, excuses for torturing and abusing and exterminating so many people.  We know exactly what we are doing...  That's why they have all of the money and all of the power.  Right?  Because of how clever they are?
                            </p>

                            <p>I wonder how many cloned people there are?  Genetically identical to someone else.  So that one of them can be organ donor for the other, should the need arise.  That will be why the ancestry stuff is...  Well, it's becoming problematic that people have access to paternity testing and genetic analysis, and the like.  I think estimates were someting like around 1/4 of people are wrong about who their genetic daddy is.  I guess there are a whole bunch of reasons why that might be so.  Of course 'she asked for it' is the best defence of the indefensible that there is.  That's why you hear it so much.  What else could they possibly say, in their defence?  Well, then, that's what 'voluntarily' means.  Clearly.  And when you get your supervisor a 100,000 + PhD thesis they say 'they thought you voluntarily quit'.  But you didn't say that you quit.  That's what makes it 'quiet quitting'.  I suppose.  Nobody hears you say 'I quit'.  They just write you up as a quitter and they don't write you a reference.  Then, if anybody asks, it's  because you are garbage garbage garbage.  Either you didn't write a thesis else they judged it to be garbage garbage garbage.  Because that's what external examination or external assessment means, now.  It means your supervisor gets to decide.  Not just whether they themselves will give you some of the vast volumes of research funds that they get (e.g., employing you as post-doc on the topic of their choosing) -- but whether anybody else is allowed to hire you.  They decide that nobody is allowed to hire you.  Because you are garbage garbage garbage.  They won't write you a reference.  They won't allow you to have your Degree.
                            </p>

                            <p>I guess the only reason he got the job is because he looks like one of Harry Harlow or Marc Hauser's laboratory animals escaped.  They will think that's soooooooo funny.  So the people from Harvard can visit Australia during their winter.  Party party party.  Let's have a party.  Let's have a weekend party where the people from Harvard can give their talks and we can just sing about how brilliant they are all day and all night...  Make sure the work we do is only singing the praises of the work they choose to present to us.  Party party.  Who wants to party?
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Of course Shortland Street is just trying to be what Grays Anatomy is trying to be..  Whatever the current version is.  Whatever it takes to sell 1 million dollar US Degrees in the USA.  Right?  And then the cost of sitting the Step exams and all the transport and flights and tourism activities associated with that...  For what?  So people can develop drug addictions (e.g., House, Nurse Jackie) or have the authority to get subordinate employees to drop their pants in the medical supply room, or whatever.  That's why people want to spend that much money on those Degrees.  Right?  It's so motivating and inspiring.  You should pay the University, pay the university, pay the University.  For the opportunity to to anything anything anything anything anything in...  In what, exactly?  In any hospital?  Anywhere in the world?
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            So the 'graduates' from Brown got to choose.  (1)  Early graduation.  That is to say, they would be given their Medical Degrees without having completed their supervised internship.  (2)  Indefinately post-poned graduation.  Because of Covid.  That is or means to say that there aren't any jobs for them.  Nobody will pay them to work that job.  Nobody will pay people to work jobs.  There aren't any jobs.  Not for things like that.  Social services.  Health, education, justice.  Everything has been overtaken by psychopaths.  It's soooooooooooooo competitive...
                            </p>

                            <p>Soo...  How are we going to motivate and inspire a future workforce of 'radiation oncologists' who will deliver lethal doses of radiation...  Gee, I don't know.  How did they motivate and inspire people to flip the switch on the legal doses of electric shock?  We find people who will just follow orders.  Not becuase the person wears a white coat.  But because...  I don't know.  Their manager told them to.  Maybe  because of the little note that someone or other put on their file notes.  You probably want a class..  Maybe 1,000 ++ studnets.  Each of them thinking that it's soooooooo competitive.  Oooooh.  I'll do anything anything anything anything anything.  Pick me!  Ooh choose me!!  Then you create division from within the cohort...  Have them turning on each other...  All the things that go into creating a compliant poplulation who will do anything anything...
                            </p>

                            <p>That's basically the culture, here.  In New Zealand.  Why suicide rates are so high.  Also 'suicide' rates (likely state ordered murders).  The volume of people imprisoned without just cause (e.g., because they protest acts of the government during their own free time outside working hours).  The volume of people imprisoned in the name of 'psychiatry'.  The judgements of the courts.  Judges -- pulled out of retirement (refusal to appoint new judges in accordance with the process that is supposed to be employed to ensure independence of the judiciary from the government).  The gaslighting in the judgements of the judges.  The judges ordering the lawyers (if the lawyers don't voluntarily go there) to gaslight the victims.  Blame the victims.  Punish the victims for speaking up and speaking out about the government atrocities and the atrocities that the government knows is happening that they refuse to do anything about.  Their constant, repeated, persistent decisions about who they hire.  Choosing to hire people to ensure their statutory function is not performed.  Is not performed by them, is not performed by anyone.  This is not the developed world.  It is not the developed world, at all.
                            </p>

                            <p>They (governments, government departments, executive branches e.g., hospitals and universities and the like) are only supposed to be hiring foreigners when there aren't any people within the country to work that job.  All the jobs in administration and management, in NZ filled by foreigners.  All the jobs in the hospitals and the universities filled  by foreigners.  While New Zealanders have their qualifications withheld and while New Zealanders are kept in detention facilities simply because they were born in New Zealand and they are not silent about the atrocities committed by the Goverment.  The Australian Federal Government will not allow people from the State of NZ to vote in Federal Elections, to stand for Federal Office.  Will not allow peope from the Australian State of New Zealand to apply (or have their application processed for) Ausstralian Federal Government Jobs.  New Zealanders are streamed into qualifications that the Australian Federal Government itself considers 'low value' and are expected to stake second stage to Australian Citizens born of every state other than New Zealand.  But then, the main purpose or point of the Australian Government is to be second rate American Government, so, well.  So they can pay a million dollars for their Medical Degrees from the Ivy League only to be informed that they can either 'Graduate Early'
  without having supervised workplace internship signed off as completed by the University.  That is to say, they can have their Degree on an 'honorary basis' else their qualification is withheld indefinately.  That is to say, they just don't choose them.  Not to go wrongful deathbringing in the detention camps of America...  Guess they will only take your money take your money take your money.  I wonder how much the guy from South Africa had to pay the New Zealand Government to play 'Orthopedic Surgeon' in the hospitals of New Zealand for 10 days before being made bachelor again.  He must have really  hated his wife to have paid to have dumped her at Hillmorton indefinately.  Did she try and speak out about the crimes of the New Zealand Government?  About his not really being an Orthopedic Surgeon?  Only 'Orthopedic Surgeon' on payroll at Canterbury District Health Board, was he?                           </p>

  <p>Their whole attitude when you complain about them not even trying to be rule of or rule by law (governed by principles of justice and fairness and rules based order) is 'and what are you going to do about it?  you and whose army?'  Does that seem like 'rule by law' to you?  I mean, not even a little bit of 'try'.
</p>

<p>They say that if people lived the way the average New Zealander lives that we would need 2 planets.  Does the average New Zealander live the way that they actually want to live -- or do they live the way that the New Zealand Government has mandated how they will live?  Are people provided with information about how to make good food choices (e.g, ingredients lists, information about how much they pay their workers, information about their health and safety compliance, information about animal welfare conditions, information about slavery in the supply chain, information about sustainable business practices) or does the Government encourage if not actively itself choose to participate in marketing campaigns etc trying to actively create demand for things that it then wants to chastise the people for?  System of abuse.  Over and over and over and over and over.  Yawn.  So f*cking tiresome.  Hey, if what England did to the Irish during the Irish famine was tolerated on the world stage then the New Zealand Government has something even worse to aspire to -- right?  It isn't that people in these parts are so very very bad at being good.  It's more how good they are at being bad.  I mean, the principle of charity can only get us so far once we realise the state sanctioned 'charity' detention camp system of abuse up and down the land...
