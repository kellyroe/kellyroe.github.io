 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">

                            <p>University of Canterbury can fire people for subcontracting out a lecture.  Lots of academics have done that, so that's a lot of potential firings.  I'm surprised that the court didn't say that they should have explained to her that she was not to do that and told her not to do it again.  Sent a memo out to all the university employees and tell them that they were not to subcontract their work or get their students doing their research and / or teaching work for them for less pay.  I would have thought that before you fired someone over something you were supposed to tell them that something was not acceptable and give them opportunity to remedey that.  But the courts of NZ have ruled that if you find that your employee has done something like that then you can fire them.  So, I wonder how many people will be fired from NZ 'Universities' now.</p>

                            <p>They fired someone who actually produced a research output of a sort.  A play.  Wrote a new play.  I would imagine or suppose that the rest of the English department would have been sooooooooooo jealous that one of the people in the department had produced a research output.  Soooooooooo jealous.  Oh my!  They would have got together for a right tongue wag!   The play would have been garbage garbage garbage rubbish rubbish would have been the verdict from all the unproductive frienemies.  Nasty.  Vindictive.  Spiteful.  Mean.  That's the way of universities when the lack of production of research output becomes the norm.  The most unproductive are often the meanest when it comes to undermining the outputs of others.  Because it's sooooooooo competitive.  </p>

                            <p>THey probably fired the most productive person in the English Department.  So they can get back, then, to business as usual, where they eye each other wariliy and call 'garbage garbage' until nobody outputs any work at all.  The race to the bottom.</p>

                            <p>It wasn't very nice of me to call my frienemies 'f*cking retards'.  But then, it was not very nice of them not to get my work out for external examination.  I'm trying to remember if I was ever nasty or mean or whatever about their work.  I'm wondering why they think it is acceptable for them to  be nasty about or over mine?  I see now that it was about my not applying for jobs that they were applying to so that they would be the only game in town.  I'm not surprised Kim Sterelny wanted to keep Rachel close -- wasn't Rachel's husband privately tutoring his daughter in math?  I guess Kim would have wanted to make sure that the got the school grades that she needed to do whatever he wanted her to be enrolled in in University.  That makes sense.  Why he would have been keen to have Rachel and Rachel's husband kept around.  Why didn't my work go out to externals Rachel?  How about your work..  Did your work ever go out to externals?  Did you get reports from external examiners who were independent enough from Sterelny and the production of your research for them to be independent?  I wonder because I remember Nick saying that his externals didn't have so much as a typographical alteration for him to make.  THey just accepted his thesis without any changes at all.  Which, more recently, I've thought is most likely to be the case when...   Why, when the Univesrity simply says that they sent it out to examiners and simply says that they didn't have any changes.  I mean to say...  Who externally examines a thesis and doesn't find so much as a sentance that can be restructured?  A single typo to be corrected?  Another reference to be added?  It just doesn't sound plausible to me at all that someone be paid however much to externally examine a thesis and then..  Not write examiners reports of that thesis, at all.  It sounds to me like it was not sent out for external examination.  They just gave him the Degree.</p>

                            <p>Nasty business.  Nasty business, indeed.  You are right Sterelny.  Australasia does not have an education and training system, at all.  There's nothing there.  It got overtaken by the likes of you.  F*cking psychopaths.  </p>
