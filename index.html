                            <p>
                            This is a website that I put together relatively quickly so that people can see evidence of some of the things that I have done.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The writing page contains a variety of writing samples where I am the first, or only author.  The samples range from fairly tightly written technical pieces in philosophy and psychology to longer explorations or investigations where the role of the philosopher is supposed to be the 'critic and conscience of society'.  You will find samples of my undergrad and honors research and coursework.  A MA thesis, MPhil thesis, PhD thesis.  A co-authored book chapter.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The seminars page contains more than a dozen seminars that were presented to departmental seminars or international conferences.  I have provided the written version of the talk and powerpoint presentation for the majority of them.  </p>

                            <p>The teaching page provides a list of courses I have taught and the subject contents that I was sub-contracted to develop to help the students understand the contents of a texbook that I was told to teach from.</p>

                            <p>The judicial review page provides a list of legal proceedings that I have filed with various courts of New Zealand.  Presently, the Social Security Appeals Authority is required to pass judgment on whether or not the Ministry of Social Development's decision to refuse to provide advance benefit payment for security for costs set by court of appeal on grounds that 'Justice is not an essential need' is to be upheld or to be overturned.  There was a substantive hearing of this matter in September of 2022 and judgment is awaited.</p>

                            <p>Neil Quigley instructed me to complain to the Office of the Ombudsman and then take the University to Court if I was unhappy with how the University of Waikato handled my enrolment etc in 2018-2019.  I was very unhappy with them (1) refusing to enrol me in the programme I applied to (2) recording I  had been enrolled in programmes I never applied to.  (3)  Refusing to get a thesis that I submitted for examination out to external examiners so as to prevent them accepting it.  (4)  Sending a thesis I submitted for MPhil examination out for 'doctoral reports' to be written (sending it out to be examined for the wrong degree).  (5)  Refusing to base the outcome of external examination on the reports of external examiners.  How could any of this be considered acceptable?  Justice Toogood was reappointed from his retirement to write reports on the untimely deaths of Mason Pendrous and Olivia Podmore.  He was also given his day in court hearing Roe v University of Waikato legal proceedings. </p>

                            <p> New Zealand does not seem to have a functioning tertiary education system.  The 'Universities' are not processing applications to enrol.  They are not acknowledging progression through training programmes.  They are not graduating people who have done the work for their degrees.  I am trying to remember whether ANY of the students at the Australian National University actually had their work go out for external examination at all, or whether the University simply decided that they had done enough for their degrees.  The Australian National University kept Carl Brusse re re re enrolled for more than 10 years as a doctoral student.  Correct?  How many times over did he write doctoral theses for the Australian National University while they only take more and more and more money from the government for keeping him re re re re enrolled.  So that his supposed 'supervisors' can be paid hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of base salary and research funding.  While they refuse to do the supervision job for which they are paid (where is the evidence of my being supervised?  Evidence of meetings?  Evidence of written comments on my written work?)   What education and training system?</p>

                            <p>The University of Auckland is not processing applications to enrol in Medicine properly, at all.  They are throwing away applications when they don't have grounds to.  They don't get to decide whether or not domestic adults are eligible to be enrolled in that programme. The Education and Training Act proclaims that they are eligible.  But the 'Universities' prefer to traffick in teenagers.  Enrolling them in programmes they never applied to, refusing to allow them to be externally examined, deporting them without their qualifications so as to replace them with new studnets.  The new students can be put to work, then, in the name of 'internships' so they can provide research work to the 'university' or nursing work or whatever...  Passing themselves off as doctors in the hospitals and so on...  While they pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the 'Universities' for no supervision and no training.  What tertiary education system?  There doesn't seem to be anything there.  By the time various people take out hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year (particularly people who are over 65 after having taken more than 40 years of government payroll already) there doesn't seem to be anything there.</p>

                            <p>WHERE IS THE MONEY, BUDDY???  WHERE IS THE MONEY??  ONLY OVER YOUR DEAD BODIES, YOU SAY???  HOW MANY  YEARS AM I SUPPOSED TO GIVE YOU WORK FOR PHD CREDIT FFS??  F*CKING PSYCHOPATHS...</p>

                            <p>Apparently I cannot be found to be correct in the High Court Proceedings because I am self-represented and self-represented litigants cannot win costs.  But costs are required to follow the judgment.  So, one man's modus ponens is another man's modus tollens.  I cannot win costs, therefore I cannot be found to be substantively correct.  Justice Fitzgerald was able to award me a reduction in costs against me in virtue of my being technically correct on a technical matter.  What justice is this?  What courts?</p>

                            <p>New Zealand does not seem to have a functioning health system, education system, judiciary.  There really doesn't seem to be anything there.  I don't even see people trying, actually...  WHERE IS MY MONEY, BUDDY?  WHERE IS MY MONEY?  FOR HOW MANY YEARS AM I SUPPOSED TO DO ALL OF THE F*CKING WORK FOR NONE OF THE MONEY?  Where are all the legal aid lawyers who are supposed to represent the students when the 'Universities' refuse to enrol them, acknowledge progression through training, refuse to graduate them after they have done the work for their qualifications?  I guess they aren't graduating lawyers or doctors any more than they are graduating much in the way of anybody else.  How does it go?  Only graduate the ones who cannot do filings.  Is that the idea/l?  </p>

                            <p>So...  What is the government's plan, then, since they aren't going to get their draft of shipping people off to the Ukraine so they can shut up about how much they have been abused at the hands of various government employees who don't seem to do much of anything at all regarding the things they are supposed to do in order for them to be paid.  Just waiting for them to die, we are, apparently.  So that the next generation can live.  I don't know why they aren't willing and or able to share, but the choices they have made.  They kept Carl enrolled for more than 10 years.  Taking his work and getting more and more and more money for having him enrolled.  They stole from him.  Where is my money?  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                            <p>What education and training system?  Apparently medical students have enough time in their day to study medicine, attend their internship, and fitness model group fitness (making up their own flows) in Les Mills Group Fitness classes, every day.  I see Les Mills offers an apprenticeship model of who gets to teach their classes (not).  I don't know how she does it.  Superman!  I don't know how Amy does it.  ER doc and making up her own dance routines?  Spin fitness modelling?  That's what it meeeeeeans to be a medical student or an emergency room physician.  It means spending however many hours of however many days travelling between Les Mills gyms making up your own flows teaching people fitness.  Sure it does.  Yeah, right.  And being a lawyer involves...  Applying for extensions on filing deadlines?  Is that right?  So the judges can say that it isnt' that they are late with their judgments, it's that the lawyers aren't capable of doing their filings.  And the research outputs of those paid to do research at the 'universities' (when they aren't appropriating their studnets work or others journal submissions for their own) is... Uh...  What education and training system?  Fraud upon all of the people?  That one?  WHERE IS THE MONEY, BUDDY?  THE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR QUIGLEY TO REFUSE TO EMPLOY RESEARCHERS.  Where does the research funding go?  The studnet scholarships most often aren't being paid to the studnets at all.  They tell the studnets they didn't get scholarships (for example) when they were supposed to be straightforwardly handed out on the  basis of academic merits.  GPA.  THey refuse to acnowledge GPAs that were awarded to studnets at their own institution ffs.  There's really  nothing there, hey.  Scummy scummy scam.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  WHERE IS THE MONEY, BUDDY????</p>

                            <p>That is a good idea.  For the senior doctors to go on strike.  Get out.  Don't come back.  See ya!  Where are all the studentst that you trained?  GET OUT.  DON'T COME BACK NOW, YA HEAR???</p>
