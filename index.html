                            <p>They are talking about recruiting for 'Public Health Registrars' like that's actually a thing.  Medical Doctors being paid not to work with patients.  I suppose pathologists don't work with patients.  They don't get the consent forms from the patient to say that they consent to this that or the other  being done to their cells for the purposes of obtaining this or that information to be provided back to them, then, in a timely fashion.  Radiologists don't get the informed consent forms from the patient to say that they consent to this or that dose of radiation being applied to them for the purposes of investigating them for this or that or the other of their complaints.  I don't suppose the, uh, 'people' being employed to do population health need to bother about the goals or wishes or aspirations or desires or consents or otherwise of the members of the herd.  Just take what you know from vetrinary science (Massey) and apply it to the herd.  All the principles of behaviorism and gaslighting from cognitive psychology with a little pharmaceutical kicker if need be.  For the interests of the patient, of course.  Not the interests of the we happy few who have decided that herds of people are required to be sacrified because they have no intention of retiring at age 65 and there simply isn't anything left for anybody else.</p>
