                                <p>
                                    People are lonely for community?  But it's sooooooooooo competititive!  It's sooooooooooo competitive!  It's sooooooooooo competitive.  There never will be enough to go around and people are like chickens with the pecking order and being with people is just a constant fight of 'I'm better than you' and 'I'm trying to stab you in the back' and 'I'm just  frienemy really trying to figure how to make myself look better than you'.  It's a fight for the all-important resources.  Money to pay pretty young things to do anything anything anything outside a nightclub on a Saturday night, and so on.  It's such a friendly friendly place to be, New Zealand.  Yeah, right. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                   The function of purpose of this thing they like to call 'Law', in New Zealand, appears to be a mechanism or way of the powerful to oppress others.  THe laws aren't things that protect the people or serve their interests.  The interests of community, say.  The laws are things that prevent and prohibit community by themselves simply being an expression of the depravity of those who knew in the depths of their hearts that the real meaning or purpose or function or point of life was to grubby grub grub their way up some social hierarchy where they could do anything anything anything with complete and utter impunity. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                   Nice. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Now think about what 'Medicine' and 'Healthcare' means in a nation such as this...  Ashley needs to earn half a million dollars per year  because he knows full well if he wants healthcare he will need to pay for it overseas.  International tourist rates.  If he needs an ambulance at the bottom of a cliff it's a chopper ride to Sydney, at the very least.  Assuming they have Medical Doctors.  I mean the Australian National University doesn't seem willing or able to process applications to enrol, these days.  Can't / won't supervise graduate student research (check my former supervisors email outbox for evidence to the contrary).  Can't / won't get studnets work out to externals for it to be externally examined even if it can't / won't employ anybody willing and / or able to supervise graduate student research.  I mean, if that's the state of the Australian Natioanal University, and every other University in Australasia is forced to 'get in behind' that state of affairs then it really isn't hard to see, at all, why there is no community in Australasia.  Despite their very best efforts to educate us otherwise with such gems as 'Home and Away', 'Neighbours', and 'Shortland Street'.
                                </p>

                                <p>Of course, the easiest way to win a social hierarchy competition is the 'I am the only game in town' and 'there is no alternative' and 'how low can we go' exercise or activity of trying to stabotage or undermine everybody else.  Instead of creating you can simply destroy.  And that's what we see.  THe prevention and prohibition of social development.  What was that, Sterelny?  We are all slaves to some people's selfish selfish selfish.  And the selfish that's apparently or allegedly in their genes (therefore not their fault, they can't help it, one can only suppose) ensures that everything gets overtaken and taken over by psychopaths.  For sure.  So that anything of any value doesn't actually remain for any particular length of time.  It's a f*cking miracle that there is anything at all.  Any co-operation.  Any con-munity.  Miracle.  Gee...  Better take allllllll the research funding to write about it.  The New Canberra Plan, we could call it.  The race to the bottom.  For sure.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Some things were nice about Canberra...  The problem was the lack of social conscience.  Frienemies.  Riiiiiight.  It's soooooooo fun to hang out with frienemies.  The only research game in town.  
                                </p>

                                <p>Shame New Zealand doesn't really have journals...  Research outputs.  But they're supposed to get in behind, there.  I suppose there's a faint dim hope that people might get airlifted to Sydney for Medical Treatment.  But I don't know why we would think that there would be any Medical Treatment in Sydney.  I mean, if Canberra can't process applications to enrol, can't train people at Univesrity, can't get work to external examiners, then what hope is there for the rest of Australasia?  It takes the rocks from out the ground...  And it hands them over.  For sure.  The only game in town.</p>

                                <p>Apparently it is 'not appropriate' for Aaron Perkins to represent me in a legal matter.  Hmm.  What does that mean?  I have asked him to state his conflict.  I'm sure I don't need to explain his professional duties to him.  I'm sure he knows what his professional duties are.  I'm sure he knows what things like 'Law' and 'justice' mean, in New Zealand.  </p>

                                <p>Garbage garbage garbage garbage garbage garbage outputs.  Hey...  What complete and utter garbage.  Hey...  </p>

                                <p>Did you know that the Univerities of New Zealand can say that you were enrolled (and invoice your student loan for fees) for courses that you *never applied to be enrolled in*.  Wow.  Hey, check in with the IRD everyone.  About what courses the Universities of New Zealand may have recorded you enrolled in.  Maybe you think you don't need to worry because you never even applied to go to University.  That doesn't matter, though.  Apparently they choose.  They choose what (if any) courses are right for them to bill for you..  They choose.  They choose.  They choose.  That's how we have the Medical, Legal, and Engineering workforce that we have today.  The slavery model of business where you force people to work and they don't pay (or where you force people to work and to also pay you for the work that they do)  Etc.  What kind of gaslighting is this?  Indeed... </p>

                                <p>The social engineering experiment in the lack of society.  The lack of engineering.  What happens when there is no education or health or law or anything anything anything at all.  Right Sterelny?  Think about all the things of meaning and value of which there is none of.  Nothing.   Nada.  NOthing to see people.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  Who wants to party party party with the administration?  Strange how pedophiles like community.  Right?  Wrongful deathbringers?  They quite like to spend time with people, too.  Such community.  There for the taking.  Right?  Who wouldn't want to get in there and take take take take take.  It's sooooo fun.  No??  Well then.  Starve the people into compliance.  Whatever.  It's fun to be the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff because then it's 'my way or the highway' where the highway is literally being left to die.  And the point or the purpose of Medicine is killing as many as possible 'aw, at least we tried, it's sooooooo competitive'.  That's the only thing that makes any sense, really.  Of why it's soooooo competitive for all the selfish.    </p>
