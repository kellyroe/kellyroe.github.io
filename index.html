 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>I suppose I will clean this page up, at some point.  There are links to things on this page that I want to keep.
                                </p>

                                <p>I do believe that I started by speaking directly to people's faces.  Then, when they were dismissive of me, I wanted a written record of the interaction.  Then, when they were still dismissive of me, I gave them the opportunity to put things right.  Then, when they were still dismissive of me I went over their heads.  If they didn't want me screaming this stuff from the rooftops then they can't say that they didn't have the time or the oppportunity to put things right years and years and years ago.  Still, today, all the active busy-work going into delaying and obstructing and preventing and prohibiting and confusing...  No hint of 'try'.  
                                </p>

                                <p>Apparently how they treated me was some kind of model or template or ideal as to how they could treat others.   How they disabled me (how they record me as being incompetent and illiterate and so on) is a model of how they can disable anyone.  Right?  I mean, if I am illiterate then surely they can pronounce and proclaim anyone anyone anyone at all to be!  If I don't have the capacity to do math or I don't have the ability to get my work done and in on time then they are free to prounce that everybody is New Zealand is intellectually handicapped.  Anybody they want.  Right?  They can just pronounce the entire country to be, right?  I mean...  Nobody actually can do anything at all, in New Zealand.  Right?  Without a special permission exemption on personal grounds.  Right?
                                </p>

                                <p>We hear of all the crimes of the people on Government payroll as 'Medical Doctors'.  Most of them aren't, of course.  They pay the Univesrity they pay the University they pay the University and get to pass themselves off as doing or being anything anything.  Until they stop paying then it is time for them to go away.  There is nothing actually here.  Or, there's people picked because they thought they would make the next Dr Leeks or Dr Glue.  That is to say they would do any atrocities, any any any any any atrocities at all.  Try and make the little boys behave like little girls for the sexual gratification of the tourists.  Etc.  Drug the people into shutting up about the crimes of the Government and the Government Employees.
                                </p>

                            <p>The Tertiary Education Commission defines a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  
                            <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a>.  The Universities and the Courts will not accept this, however.  They will not allow people to complete their work in a timely fashion.  They force extensions.  Sometimes studnets are outright bullied into not handing their work in.  Sometimes they pretend they never received work that was in fact handed in.  If you keep records of the fact that you handed the work in before the deadline then the University and the Courts both still deny it.  They will not allow people to complete their work in a timely fashion.  Because it is not an education system.  It is an unlawful slave or detention camp for endentured servants.
                            </p>

                            <p>The Judiciary is now imploding.  Making it obvious or apparent to everyone that there isn't a functioning Judiciary, etiher.  Read the Judgements of the courts for yourself.  Particularly the Supreme Court Judgements.  See how they order or instruct me to refile and refile and refile my filings?  THere is no precedent for a self-represented litigant to win costs.  Most of the time the courts will not award the full amount of the financial costs to the successful party (they prefer to jump on the bandwagon of harming the person who is the victim of injustice even if that means blaming the victim and accusing them of being half way responsible at the very least).  That is to say New Zealand does not have a functioning judiciary.  Kim.com pays the courts he pays the courts he pays the courts so he is not extradited to stand trial in the USA.  New Zealand put out a beacon for all the criminals of the world to come to New Zealand and pay the courts of New Zealand for delays and delays and delays with no extradition.  New Zealand put out a beacon that we are a slave camp detention centre endentured servant slum of the world.

                            </p>

                            <p>This stuff gets repetitive.  There must be something wrong with me that other people no comprehend-aye?  Maybe if I explain it just one more time, just a little bit more slowly?  No?  That's not the problem?
                            </p>

                            <p>Apparently I don't get to do Medicine (really) because I passed the ethics test - where passing the ethics test means failing to gain entry to Medicine in New Zealand.  Because we don't have a health system, at all.  How much will people pay to get to do anything anything anything anything in the hospitals?  So many things that psychopaths have the desire to do...  Well, come to New Zealand, then.  No liability for any of the things that you do.  ACC will just bully your victims into shutting up else the courts will ensure that they die before any kind of justice is forthcoming at all.  For how little did the New Zealand Government sell out the health of the people?  The Government?  What's that?  Wouldn't that require an actual election and stuff?  But the people are kept in conditions where they don't even have secure post-boxes.  What Postal Service?  The one that takes post and dumps it because they will not pay the workers?  That one?
                            </p>

                            <p>THAT WILL BE A GOOD SLAVE JOB FOR YOU!!!! YOU CAN SPEND YOUR LIFE PAYING THE COURTS AND PAYING THE COURTS AND PAYING THE COURTS AND PAYING THE UNIVERSIY AND PAYING THE UNIVERSITY AND PAYING THE GOVERNMENT FOR HOUSING AND PAYING THE GOVERNMENT FOR 'ESSENTIAL COSTS' PERTAINING TO THE FACT THAT YOU WERE BORN IN THIS F*CKING STUPID STATE THAT PRETENDS TO BE A 'COUNTRY' THAT WILL BE A GOOD SLAVE JOB FOR YOU HAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAH ALL OFF THE DOCUMENTATION OF THE CRIMES FROM YOU ALL OF THE SLAVE LABOR FROM YOU ALL OF THE SLAVE FROM YOU HAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHA IF YOU AREN'T GOING TO DO IT, THEN WHO ELSE WILL?  HAHAHHAHAHHAH WHAT A GREAT JOB FOR YOU!!! BEST SLAVE EVER!!!!
                            </p>

                            <p>I would  need more than one hand to count the number of times people say 'there will be a job for you -- over my dead body'.  Guess they aren't interested in writing me a reference, then.  Certainly not for something like Medical School.  Are they dead, yet?  Are they dead, yet?  Are they dead, yet?  Are they dead?  Waiting on them to die, then, so that my life can begin...  Are they dead, yet?  Now are they dead?  How about today?  Waiting on them to die, then...  No surprises they wouldn't want me in Medical School, hey.  Surprising then, that they don't seem to mind if I serve them food or drink or I have free range in their house while they go off on holiday...  Not the brightest, one might say.  Trusting?  Apparently the problem is that I'm too stupid...
                            </p>

                            <p>Do not travel to New Zealand, there is nothing here.
                            </p>

                            <p>Apparently now, I am too old.  Other people my age grubby grub grub grub grubbed their way to PhD or MD (lolz) or JD (LMFAO) MbChB or LLB by the time they were 25.  That means they've had more than 15 years of payroll as Doctor for themselves and the families they chose to have given that they had the financial means to support them to adulthood.  Those people are supposed to retire, then, at 65, after 40 years of payroll for themselves.  That means it isn't worth training me.  They won't retire until they are 80+++ so there isn't a job for me.  Turns out there isn't a job for their children, either.  Their great idea was to take not only all the jobs of the present generation (by throwing people like me in the psych hospitals or the prisons or refusing to acknowledge receipt of their work or by taking their work for themselves and so on) but they often want their children's jobs as well.  Something something about 2 parents who are both on payroll at Massey while their child doesn't hand in his Honors work.  They need payrises so they can keep supporting him, you see.  Because he doesn't get his work in one time, so there can't be a job for him.  All of the money to them and for them insetad.  Of course.  Look at the fabulous research outputs of the University!  Just call me yo b*tch yo.  Hahahahaha better luck next generation.  I didn't have kids.  I didn't have enough to have a life worth living for myself.  I wanted to do Medicine so I could have a meaningful career.  So you should take that, too.  You should just take everything and then gnaw each others f*cking arms off for all I care.

                            <p>Here is how much the Inland Revenue now says I owe the New Zealand Government for my 'Education' and 'Training' that are not acknowledged because New Zealand qualifications apparently expire 5 years post-graduation (well, not the Judges law degrees, apparently, but my qualifications have expired): 
                            <a href="judicial-review/ird-shot.pdf" target="_self"> $104,663.</a>  You can see, then, that New Zealand does not appear to have functioning Universities, they appear to have detention or forced labor camps.  They won't progress or process academic work (particularly research).  They refuse to get official documents (theses submitted for examination) to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit external examiners signing off on qualification completions.  There is no skilled labor workforce, in New Zealand, because New Zealand has a series or system of forced labor detention camps only.  You pay the University you pay the University you pay the University you pay the University.  Maybe they put you to work as an actor playing the part of a skilled professional.  Then, when you are done paying them, your qualifications are withheld.  
                            </p>

                            
                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  They aren't progressing the filings. They are refusing to supply applications, refusing to process applications on their academic merits.  Apparently it isn't a matter of public interest how they pick and choose people to pass themsleves off as 'doctors' in our hospitals.
                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  Demanding me to pay more and more and more money to the courts else they force all my cases aborted, or abandoned.  <a href="judicial-review/sc-eyes.pdf" target="_self"> Here is the Judgement of the Supreme Court that I am attempting to appeal on the grounds that it is manifestly grotesquely unjust. </a>  It is like they have their eyes poked out.  Our highest court does not seem to have the conception of justice, at all.  It was the courts decision to delay Roe v University of Waikato proceedings until AFTER Roe v NZVCC and also until AFTER Roe v University of Auckland.  The Judge for Roe v NZVCC made all kinds of pronouncement in his judgment on the matter of Roe v University of Waikato.  That is to say instead of judging the issue he was supposed to be judging (the inaction of Chris Whelan in his capacity as CE of the NZVCC) he thought he would weigh in on whether or not I had done enough for completion of the MPhil Degree.  Clearly that is a matter of the Judge of a different case to decide!  
                            </p> 

                            <p>
                             <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  The Australian Constitution clearly names New Zealand as a state of Australia.  They say that they don't have to honor the constitution because New Zealand officials did not turn up to various things and they did not consent.  I don't know why Australia would care about consent in that instance.  Did they care about the consent of the Aboriginal people of Australia?  Did they care about consent of people to be immunised or subject to medical treatments or experimentation?  If they want to change the constitution then there is a process for it to be changed.  I think it involves a vote.  But New Zealanders don't get to vote so the Australian Government clearly does not care whether or not the people of New Zealand consent.  New Zealand functions as a detention camp of Australia.  But then, Australia still seems to govern like it is a detention camp of the Northern Hemisphere, so...
                            </p>

                            <p>Here are  <a href="judicial-review/sup-court-waikato.pdf" target="_self"> My Filings </a>to the Supreme Court regarding the University of Waikato    
                            </p>

                            <p>Una Jagose doesn't seem to have the job of instructing Crown Law to prosecute corruption within New Zealand Universities, or within the Judiciary (where judges refuse to accept evidence and where the supreme court punishes people for bringing injustices before the courts).  I suppose that is why they pay her more than half a million dollars to do that job.  They pay her to ensure the job is not done by anyone.  Not by her and not by anybody else.  The fact she is in the job prevents and prohibits the job being filled  by anyone with the willingness and ability to do the job.  It seems there is no evidence that they will accept that would attest to corruption.  None of the invoicing information that I provided (e.g., 0.5 EFTS = 120 points = 60 points = indefinate enrolment).  New Zealand does not appear to have a functioning judiciary.    <p> <a href="judicial-review/crown-law.pdf" target="_self"> Blow off response. </a>  
                            </p>

It all starts to sound confusing, doesn't it.  The gaslighting garbage output nonsense nonsene nonsense from the courts.  Denying the evidence.  Refusing to acknowledge the half of the laws that speak to the duties and responsiblities and actual job descriptions of the various government departments (e.g, the NZVCC and various of the Universities).  
                            </p>


    <p>Evidence of corruption.  <a href="writing/lawsociety.pdf" target="_self">Letter from the Law Society (PDF)</a></p>

    <p> Here we have a letter from the Law Society that declares that Philip Cornege is conflicted out of representing a party when his wife (K Cornege) has been employed by opposing counsel. 

     <a href="writing/conflict.eml" target="_self">Here is a letter from me to the Court of Appeal informing them of Phillip and K Cornege being being employed by opposing counsel in certain matters of corruption to be heard in the Court of Appeal (.eml). </a>  (The file format is .eml which means it will use your browser or your email programme to open the text file).  I notified Una Jagose of the conflict on April 25 2021 at 7:24pm by email.  K Cornege responded to me as follows:  'Phillip does not act for the Commissioner of Police, but for MAP and Associates Trustee Company Limited.  There is no conflict between our respective clients, whose interests are aligned for the purposes of the High Court proceeding and appeal.  I recognise that the Court of Appeal list is somewhat confusing as to who acts for whom.' Yes.  I am confused.  K Cornege and P Cornege are on different sides of the 'v' which means they are acting on opposing sides with respect to these proceedings.  Me soooooooooooo confuuuuuuused.  Yeeeeeeees.  That must  be the problem. The response I received from the Court of Appeal was to say 'as you are not a party to this proceeding we are unable to discuss matters of party representation with you. No correspondence will be entered in to regarding it.'  That is how the Court of Appeal saw fit to respond to my concern by email on 2 October at 10:24am.  That is to say they (to the best of my knowledge) refused to look into the conflict and / or refused to do anything at all about the apparent conflict.</p>

    <p>K Cornege of Thompkins Wake also pointed out to me that the finding of P Cornege being conflicted out of representing anybody who was opposed by the University of Waikato since they had put a dollar in her pocket - was a finding that I was supposed to keep secret and not publicise.  That he sat on filings for several months only later to claim to be conflicted out was also something that I was supposed to keep secret and not publicise.  If the Law Society had seen fit to do it's job properly then I wouldn't need to publicise it becuase things would have been dealt with internally, in house.  But the Law Society brushed off my complaint / blew off my complaint.  So I now inform the public so they know what kind of people they may be dealing with.  I see that P Cornege is now claiming on his website to be employed by the Government for the abuse in state care inquiry.  I wonder if this is because they have collected up evidence of him being willing to delay proceedings and being willing to blame the complainant (e.g., construe Roe v University of Waikato as my being upset I did not get my qualification rather than an issue to do with how they are incorrectly invoicing students and how they are mishandling official thesis documents etc).
    </p>

    <p>You can see from the letter that the Law Society said I needed to pay them $50 if I wanted to take the complaint further.  I did the filings for taking the complaint further.  I filed that IF Mr Cornege was in fact conflicted out (as the Law Society found that he was) THEN he did not get to have a professional opinion on the mertis of the case.  I did not have $50 at the time to pay the filing fee that the Law Society asked of me.  I requested the Law Society waive the fee in my case on the same grounds that the High Court waives filing fees for people in receipt of Work and Income Benefit. The Law Society response to that was that they did not have to, I could not make them, and I was to pay them, otherwise there would be no justice for me.  That's the Law Society.  The professional body governing professionalism in Law in New Zealand.  Refusing to consider a case where someone claims to be conflicted out of progressing proceedings... Where the guy delays filings for a couple  months and (more problematically in my mind) he insisted on construing the case as a case with no merit.  That is or means to say he insisted on construing the case as being me being personally upset about not getting the qualification.  When my filings construed the case for the Law Courts as being a matter of the Univesrity acting Ultra Vires.  Issues of them not doing what the Law stated they were required to do when it came to processing applications and when it came to them incorrectly invoicing, keeping false records of studnet progress, false transcripts, adn misusing official thesis doucments by refusing to examine them.
    </p>

<p>It seems to me that there is an apparent conflict.  I am sorry that Philip Cornege was not willing to regulate his behavior.  But he did not, so I had to complain to the Law Soceity. I am sorry that the Law Society did not deal with it.  They didn't, so then the issue comes up for the Court of Appeal.  I am sorry that they did not deal with it.  They didn't, so now the issue goes before the public.  Every oppportunity.  Every opportunity.  I start by being reasonable and rational and polite.  FOR HOW MANY YEARS SHOULD I BE PATIENT BEFORE IT'S TIME TO SCREAM?  AT WHAT POINT DO I THINK IT MIGHT BE NICE WERE THE WRATH OF THE GODS TO RAIN UPON YOU.  Hey that's a good reason to arrange for people to be murdered and start over with a new lot of kiddies.   
    </p>


    <p>Universitites, District Health Boards, Government Departments are not being fair in the way they handle (actually mis-handle) applications.  Concrete examples.  The University of Waikato wanted to have a yakkity yak yak yak yak yak about why I had not been ranked for PhD (doctoral) scholarship in their meeting about who was going to be granted doctoral scholarships when I never applied to the doctoral programme with that University.  The Waikato District Health Board advertised a $5,000 masters research scholarship where the successful candidate was to give a talk to the DHB.  I have repeatedly asked (including under OIA) for the name of the receipient of that scholarship in 2018 because I have a strong suspicion that they did not give the funding to any actual student and instead decided to have a party party party for themselves.  They refuse to supply me with information as to when the student gave their talk to the DHB and where there masters research thesis actually is so that I can see the project that they funded with public money (yeah, right).

    <p>Streaming in schools
    </p>
    <p>_______________________________</p>

    <p>We should just have everybody in one large hall.  When they arrive at school we should ussher them into the hall and barricade the doors and set it on fire.  No, that's something else.  We shouldn't do that.  We should herd them into smaller classrooms.  Is it 30 kids to 1 teacher these days?  With a 'teacher aid' to take out anybody who doesn't keep there head sufficiently down and give them the bash or whatever needs to be done to teach them to keep their head down or stay the hell away.  Keep getting money for having them on the roll and not having them in the classroom.  Or having them in the classroom if they are sufficiently good at bullying the hell out of the other students and teaching them to keep their heads down in that way.
    </p>

    <p>How do we decide what classroom to put the kids in?  I guess you probably want for there to be a big bully in each and every class..  Probably.  Distribute them.  Like how you distribute gang bangers into communities later in life, to keep their communities in line.  Entertain the children and so on.  
    </p>

    <p>Traditionally, the idea was to stream them all by age.  Right?  So, to be simple about it.  First grade.  For one year.  Then second grade for one year.  Then third grade for one year.  Kids started school at what age?  There was a way of sorting or doing that.  Bit like race horses.  So the kids have their academic ages.  I think hockey does that, too.  Ice Hockey in Canada.  That's how they end up with the biggest kids, usually, being the ones who were born at a certain time of the year.  Because they are actually a bit older then the other kids who were streamed into the same cohort or division or whatever you want to call it.  So, then, streaming on the basis of age.
    </p>

    <p>But then...  Some kids start school when they are 5.  And other kids don't start school until they are 7.  Is that right?  You don't have to start school until you are 7?  And then other kids, really really want to go to school when they are 4.  And they are toilet trained and able to be attentive in class and so on.  Maybe because they only have older siblings and they want to be like them.  Going to school like them.  So, if the 4 year old and the 5 year old and the 6 year old and the 7 year old all turn up for first grade (let's call it that, I don't know what it is here.  Early Entrance class?  Perhaps the idea/l is to keep them detained and not learning until the 7 year olds arrive and then they can all learn together as one cohort)?  I don't know how it is supposed to go.  But you can see problems with the idea/l of age cohort streaming, right there.
    </p>

    <p>It isn't nice or fun or a good learning experience for the 4 year olds.  Likely to be the smallest and most bullied and picked on.  'You think you are so smart you think you are better than us' and so on.  It isn't nice or fun or a good learning experience for the 7 year olds.  Likely to be the largest and having trouble getting a handle on everything that is going on.  'You think you are so smart you think you are better than us' and so on.  Let's all work, then, to placate the bullies.  When they are kept 30 to a teacher, was it?  Let's all learn to keep our heads down.
    </p>

    <p>Maybe if you streamed them more strictly by age.  So that no 4 year olds or 7 year olds were in that class.  They could all be 5 and 6.  But still, you would get the same variation within the cohort  becuase people are not all the same.
    </p>

    <p>Should we, then, take something like Khan Academy Math Curriculum Contents and teach all of it simultaneously to a class of 30 kids who have not been streamed on the basis of age or on the basis of academic performance?
    </p>

    <p>How would you do that?  I guess every kid could have a book.  A math book, say.  And they could work through that book (and check their answers in a timely fashion so they are acquring the concepts and not being bombarded with questions where they don't have timely feedback on their answers).  I guess you could do that.  But then every kid would  need to work individually since every kid is working at their own pace and every kid is starting from a different starting place and also often working at a different pace depending on the quality of their nutrition and their intrinsic motivation and whether they are upset about being sexually molested in their Government accommodations).  But math teachers aren't allowed to enforce silent individual anything in the schools, anymore.  They also aren't allowed to stream the cohort on the basis of their starting place or on the basis of assumptions about how much or how little they are able to progress every day...
    </p>

    <p>Why would you stream on the basis of academic performance?  That's the question?  I ask: why would you not stream on the basis of academic performance?  What does that mean?  Put them all in one big room together?  Randomise the streaming?  Is that the idea?  Why wouldn't the same people who have corrupted academic ability streaming work to corrupt randomised streaming?  The problem is the cheats and the corruption.
    </p>

    <p>Here is a problem in math...  Who can do it (who has  been taught how to do it, who can do it?)  Those kids need to be taught something else,  now.  Who can't do it (who has not been taught how to do it?  Who can't do it, yet?)  Those kids need to be taught that thing.  Why is this so hard?
    </p>

    <p>Oh, yeah.   Because people think that 'academic performance'  is only something that the teachers or administrators kids are allowed to do or are allowed to have.  That is their birthright.  That's what it meeeeeeeans to be academically performing.  For your parents to be SQuigly fixing your grades.  
    </p>

    <p>So that measures of academic performance don't actually track academic performance.
    </p>

    <p>What was wrong with the high end classes being streamed (not on the basis of academic performance but on the basis of who the kids parents were or how much money (in some instances) they were willing to pay to have people SQuigley fix their grades) was simply the other end of the problem where they intentionally put certain kids into a class in order to indoctronate them into believing that they were congenitally academically deficient in one or all things irrevokably and unremediably.  I mean, they were telling the converse to the kids in the highest class.  Right?  But on both cases it was a hokey scummy scam.
    </p>

    <p>But that practice isn't streaming kids on the basis of academic performance.  Not really.  It's streaming them on the basis of corruption.  WHo their parents are and how much money they might be able to get in bribes or whatever (which becomes very very important when the government or the executive school people won't pay the teachers so the 'teachers' are forced to work for bribes or whatever if they want to exist in the schools at all).  Like how SQuigley fixing isn't fixing things, really, it is breaking them.  Like how doctoring your stats isn't really doctoring.  Like how water care isn't about helping purify the water.  Like how equity isn't about justice or fairness at all.  Like how justice isn't about justice.  And so on...
    </p>

    <p>We must be forced between only 2 options.  Firstly, kids can be streamed on the basis of who their parents are and how much money they hand over to have their academic work SQuigley fixed for admission, progression, graduation.  Otherwise, we can randomise the thing, then.  Maybe the teachers and administrators and rich people's kids will find themselves randomly in the same classes or maybe they will find themselves academically streamed there.  What's the difference?  What we will not do is have a functioning education system.  Where people are actually allowed to learn things and then employed to put their skills to work helping people or society or teaching others.  Everything is all SQuigley fixed (aka f*cked up).  Indeed.  They will not pay the teachers, they will not pay teh teachers, they will not pay the teachers, they will not pay the teachers.  So, then, the only people remaining as 'teachers' are people who are making their money off of bribes or pimping the kids out or what have you.  That is to say...  There is no education system.  Nothing to see, at all.
    </p>

    <p>Go to school and keep your head down... Try and fly under the radar.  Always.  There is no other way to be, in New Zealand.  
    </p>

    <p>The Universities are the same, now.  They stream kids into what Degree they believe is right for the kid on the basis of information they have about the students home address and race and so on.  They might have these really large first year classes (so they can employ 1 lecturer per 1,000 kids or something equally ridiculous) but that's just designed to have the kiddies believe that it's sooooooooo competitive it's sooooooo competitive it's soooooooo competitive.  Look at all the kiddies who never had a chance starting to realise that and chewing each others arms off or chewing their own arms off or killing themselves or killing each other it's sooooooo competitive.  But there's nothign you can do...  I mean...  It isn't like studying harder or smarter has any effect.  Because academic achievement and academic streaming isn't based on things like how hard and how smart you studied.  You are more likely to get picked for the programme you want if you party party party at the VC's house than if you spend the weekend studying intelligently.  Assuming the test questions even make any sense, half the time.  Assuming any integrity in the grading.  Assuming that they use the numeric outcomes from that kind of thing for the streaming, at any rate.  I mean to say, I know that there are some teachers who work really hard to teach well and grade fairly -- but in those cases or situations often the University or Central Education Processing Whatever for Secondary School will intervene between the fair graders and the grades in the name of making 'adjustments' or whatever.  But really they scramble or scrabble the signal.  SO that their own children don't look like they have been expediated unfairly.  They want to make sure the cohort is of kids that make their own kids look like they are obviously and clearly the best.  
    </p>

    <p>For example, the 'cool kids' in first year.  Because they know that it doesn't really matter what they do...  They will get their place because of birthright, or similar.  And however many other 'cool kids' (maybe who don't really want to do it who can be bullyed into fleeing before graduation or shortly thereafter) so that their kids don't stand out as being cool.  Or whatever...
    </p>

    <p>The race to the bottom...
    </p>

    <p>How would you do it, then?  Well...  If school isn't to be about sitting around singing the praises of the biggest bully all day...  That is to say if it is to be about adademics rather than politics...  Then what is wrong with Khan Academy?  Kids can start wherever they need to and learn at their own pace.  We don't want kids learning / we don't value kids learning.  We don't want teachers or doctors or lawyers or whatever...  We don't want people knowing anything, really.  We just want them sitting about sing sing sing sing singing our praises every day.  What do they do with the kids they identify as academically advanced?  They will say 'academically advanced for your age' and they will get the kid sitting in the naughty corner or sitting on their hands until they believe the other kids have caught up.  Surpassed, even.  Can I start Medical School, now?  Am I ready, yet?  I waited and I waited and I waited and I waited...  Still waiting...  Ooooh...  I waited sooooo long that y'all think that I'm slow.  
    </p>

    <p>Well, I must be stupid.  Right?  Not to have kept my head down and huddled in with the herd.  Ooooh.  You mean the bus out to Tamaki herd?  That herd?  That would have been better for you, would it?  So the cool kids could take the places they were always going to be handed.  So they could get to work following orders to order however many other people's kids off on the bus to Tamaki.  Sounds like a great job for me!  
    </p>

    <p>The costly fitness trap that is New Zealand.  It is basically a social experiment in costly fitness traps.  It is very very much about political power.  Yeah.  We are all slaves to the biggest bully.  Everything is decided on personal or emotional or charasmatic...  The emotion system hijacking the frontal lobes.  Reason or rationality is subservient to personal or emotional or charasmatic.  THey most value the cool calm and collected psychopath who is most charasmatic.  Would be singing motivationally and inspirationally while other people's kids are marched off to the death camps.  
    </p>

    <p>No education.  No health.  No justice.  No meaning.  No value.  Nothing to see, people.  Not even people, hey.  Herds of things gnawing each other's arms off.  Squabbling and squawking and so on...  The unruly masses..  To incentivise only why Jacinda will have to pay and pay and pay and smile and wink and nudge and so on and so forth to have her darling daughter identified as 'academically special' all the Honorary Degrees from Harvard for her so people can listen to her listen to her listen to her listen to her all day....  Or maybe she'll just eat her.  I don't really understand why anybody would choose to have a kid given the current climate.  Oh, but this is just my experience becuase someone wrote a little note on my files at some point saying that I was for the death camps.  Right?  Or to be excluded or shunned.  Why, again?  Oh,  because it's soooooooo competitive.  The academics, thing.  It is about SQuiggley fixing the next generation.  That requires me to have a kid who I will do anything anything anything for...  Where anything anything likely means being active in being a SQuiggley fixer myself.  I guess that's the idea.  The children hostages.  
    </p>

    <p>Don't get sick y'all.  It's sooooooooooo competitive!  
    </p>

    <p>They are pushing pretty hard,  now, saying that the ER's are overcrowded by people 'voluntarily' turning up to them.  Yeah, right.  Weren't the ambulance officer volunteers finding them and ramping them outside the ER?  Wasn't that the pipeline of paying customers?  They get invoiced or billed if they complain about being involuntarily detained by the hostpial.  Right?  Very lucrative system of government kidnapping you got there. For the entertainment of your darling children, I suppose.  
    </p>

    <p>The problem is the social inqualities.  People will do anything anyting for their kids to have them part of the top end and not the bottom.  Because of how they want to treat the 'other' people on the bottom.  We have a disappearing or vanishing working class.  They won't pay people to work those jobs.  They get the students passing themselves off as working class but they aren't paid for their work, they pay the University they pay the Unviersity they pay the Courts they pay teh Government for all of the borrowing they need to do to eat and to live in housing.  Then they dump them at the bottom.  The top end is shrinking, too.  Any excuse to dump more and more and more at the bottom.  They'll do anything anything anything to avoid their kids being dumped at the bottom.  Unless it comes down to them vs their kids.  In which case.  Well, their kids were their insurance policy.  Right?  There to be eaten if times got tough. 
    </p>

    <p>Look at how we pick the kids to study Medicine.  Look at what we want or hope or expect that those kids will do.  Look at how we expect them to triage (on the basis of home address or post-code as a proxy for their value or worth as people and on the basis of information about race and the like we decide about how much money we can get for them if their family or whomever starts a gofund me or kickstarter for whatever problem we claim to have found).  Look at what we expect them to do.  Look at what they are required to do in order to be on payroll.  Look at the things they are required to do in order to be on some kind of payroll or in order to be in the hospitals at all.  All the work that goes into ensuring that there's nothing here.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing at all.
    </p>

    <p>Rocket Lab has nothing to do with New Zealand (except that it is located geographically).  Microsoft..  It's an empty shell of a building.  It's a logo on the wall only.  Nothing nothing nothing.  There's nothing here.   Nothing to see, at all.  The 'attacks' to our IT infrastructure...  When people try and book something (book rooms in quarantine or buy shares in the stock market)...  There's nothing here.  The health record and education records.  The double book-keeping.  The SQuigley fixing the 'information', no doubt.  The things you need to falsely record about others to make you and your own look like the only game in town.
    </p>

    <p>The Government is going to directly commission research, now.  Is that the idea?  All the 'independent inquiries' and 'independent investigations' and 'independent reports'.  Instead of having researchers research things that they value (things of value and so on) the Government will decide what research is allowed and the content of hte report and so on.  The Government decided that the report on disabiltiy must  be completed under conditions of lateness only because it is by definition more costly.  Because the schools and universities claim more money for people who have bounties on their heads.  If a school claims to be a 'special school' devoted to having people believe that they are costly to society to keep around then the Government will pay them extra for all the good work that they do, there.  That's the sort of idea.
    </p>

    <p>They can get people like Chris Whelan on payroll or Una Jagose and they can go 'the point or purpose or function of these people is to ensure the job description is not filled by them is not filled by anyone'.  Then they could point out that Jacindas Daughter could do an equally good job of it today.  Give her the payroll and titles, then.  They could also point out that the most severely handicapped person in the psych hospital could also do it equally well.  As could the coma patient.  Well, then.  ALl of the money can go where the money was always going to go.  Tragedy of commons nasty bruitish and short costly fitness trap that is New Zealand.  Too much corruption.
    </p>

    <p>The Education and Training Act says that people are entitled to Secondary Schooling up until the age of 20.  It also says that people are entitled to Tertiary Education (to be enrolled in the programme of their choosing) once they have attained the age of 20 years.  In practice, the Tertiary Education Institutions have targeted under 20  year olds.  To the point where the vast majority of people taking on debt or whose parents are paying for them to be enrolled in Universities are under the age of 20.  They try and fill up the Medicine and Law Degree programmes with the youngest children they can get away with.  The Supreme Court Justice was selected for...  Uh...  Her motivating and inspiring speeches about  how she was a fashion model?  Is that right?  And then she went from fashion into law but she still has a real interest in keeping the bar on how the girls particularly are to be dressed in their internships...  It's important to really market and advertise and promote everything it is that we value for Law so that the teenagers are motivated and inspired to get themselves into debt and get their parents paying howeve rmuch in bribes...  So they can put on a fancy suit or whatever and entertain the senior partners.  Was it...  I can't remember the name of the Law Professor from Otago who liked to watch them run about naked at law camp. They gave  him a promotion to work out of Auckland, now.  They thought he could get a good Law Camp of naked teenagers going on at Auckland.  If he does a good job of it maybe he will make it to Sydney or Melbourne before he turns 90?  Is that the plan?
    </p>

    <p>Quickly quickly quickly!  Everybody knows the people with the most ability and talent and merit for singing are the pre-pubescent alter boys hand-picked by pedophiles. Everybody knows those kids have most merit.  Most talent for music.  Rinse and repeat.  What it is that we value...
    </p>

    <p>No education no health no wealth (economy doing poorly and very high suicide rates) nothing to see...  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  
    </p>

    <p>Oh, YOU CHOOSE!  YOU CHOOSE what degree I should enrol in.  Oh, YOU CHOOSE whether you will arrange for external examination of my work by someone who doens't know me at all and doesn't know anything about the production of the work and who has never met me and who doesn't know how old I am or if I like to party or not..  YOU CHOOSE to refuse to allow them to examine my work.  Socrates said 'the unexamined life is not worth living'.  That is or means to say they decided to fail me themselves because they decided themselves that my life was not worth living.  The reason they did not get my work to externals was not because they thought externals would fail me.  They failed me themselves.  They did not get my work to externals because they thought it likely that externals would pass me.
    </p>

    <p>Don't get sick!

    </p>

    <p>Look out!  Here comes a St Johns 'volunteer'
    </p>

    <p>Do they get money for every person they dump in the 'hospital'?
    </p>

    <p>Staying at Salmond College I was supposed to have access to Knox in-house tutorials.  I remember turning up for a scheduled Bio-Chemistry tutorial on a Friday night in about week 3 of the first semester and running into the Master of the House.  The Residential Hall seemed very quiet and pretty empty.  He laughed at me when I said I turned up for a scheduled tutorial.  He said that everyone in the hall had gone on an arranged skiing weekend trip.  I don't know if they were skiing or if they were working individually.  Either way...  Otago is the dumping ground for when the elite can't get their kids into the US or Canada or the UK or Australia...  So things are very nasty nasty nasty particularly nasty in these parts. 
    </p>

    <p>I mean, who would rather spend their time studying bio-chemistry (in order to better understand bio-chemistry) rather than going skiing?  Not many people.  Therefore we must take the academic contents out of the 'academic classes' in order to proclaim Jacinda Ardern the rightful recipient of a 5 year law degree.  Was it?  For all of the qualities that it is that we most value.  We want the Medical Doctors to look us meaningfully in the eyes and whisper sweet nothings.  Awwwwww.  Feeeeeeeeel  better.  Furrowed brow.  I am expressing that I am very concerned.  Empathy.  All of that.  While putting together or reaching out for the final solution needle to put us out of our misery for having a life they deemed not worth living.  That's the grand strategy plan for Medicine.  Who wants to be a Medical Doctor?  You get to play doctors and nurses practicing on each other...  Seeing the girls bare their chests so you can check their heart etc etc.  What 18 year old boy wouldn't want to sign up for that Degree wink wink nudge nudge.  We need to market it so that people want to do it.  The 'right kind' of people.  The 'right kind' being the ones who...  Will collect the most money for holding the most hostages?  Is that the idea/l?  
    </p>

    <p>Actually speaking to the kids at Salmond College...  They did not start out all wanting to grubby grub grub grub their way into Medicine or Law.  Most of them said they had no idea what they wanted to do with themselves, yet.  They mostly said they wanted to study a range of subjects in Arts and Science and various things.  They said they wanted to try things they had not studied at school.  They said they had done really well at school.  Most of them said they mostly got Excellences.  So, I'm wondering, why they are staying at school (given they are entitled until they turn 20) and enrolling in the various classes that they still want to learn...  At school rather than paying money paying money paying money getting into debt with the University.
    </p>

    <p>The University taught them to 'aim for the top and settle for what you get' so by the end of week 2 everybody is saying they want to do Medicine.  Then, all of a sudden, with all of the demand that has been created by the Univesrity for that programme some people's parents will pay how much to expediate their enrolment in that Degree?  What a f*cking farce.
    </p>

    <p>Most of the first year kids across the University were saying they got Excellences for most or everything when they were at High School.  So it was a shock to them to discover, at University of Otago that they had been streamed already (by the University) into getting the grades they were going to be given at the end of the first year.  To position them on what the University taught them was a hierarchy.
    </p>

    <p>At the start of the year, also, some students seemed fairly clear on things they wanted to pursue.  I was particularly interested to hear from the kids who were interested in Sport and Exercise and Physio.  Then seeing how the University got them themselves internalising the idea/l that those subjects were 'dumb subjects' in comparison to Medicine for people who were streamed into them.
    </p>

    <p>We don't have an education and training system.  We have a slave detention camp for the purposes of identifying or picking out some people to play the role of prison guard.  Nothing to do with academics, really.  That's just the front.  But then the health system and judicial system etc etc appear to be nothing other than fronts, also.  No hint of 'try'.  Look at the lengths they are prepared to go to (the blatant disregard of the laws by the judiciary for example) to persist in their wrongs.
    </p>

    <p>I mean, everybody knows what it means to be doctor is to be paid to play golf.  Right?
    </p>

    <p>It is the vanishing or disappearing middle class.  THe government won't pay teachers and nurses and police and so on.  THey figure ways to make their money -- but then they aren't functioning as teachers and nurses and police and so on.  There aren't any teachers and nurses and police and so on.  Detention camps up and down the land...  I guess the bombs will drop any old day.  Nothing here.  Nothing at all.  Final solution to the problem of most under-productive economy in the world.  Nothing to see.  Nothing here.  No education and training.  No skilled workers.  No skilled work.  What you have to do to get a pay cheque these days.  Just trying to eat.  Sure.  Eating each others arms off.  It's sooooooooo competitive.  Divide and conquer.  Infighting squabbling bitching moaning and carrying on.  Wailing.  Gnashing of teeth.  Not honoring contracts.  No functioning judiciary.  Nothing.  There's nothing here.  
    </p>

    <p>All of the Government workers on $200,000++++ per year.  They can't afford to spend $100,000 NZD (say $50,000 USD) per year to have their kids go to Harvard?  Full fee paying international student fees for the very very very very best of the US private schools.  They can't full fee pay their kids way into there?  The New Zealand public servants serving the public for all the work they do fulfilling their function according to statute.  No ammount of money would buy their kids a place...  Not in the US, not in the UK, not in Canada, not in Australia.  Get in behind, every other New Zealander.  Get in behind those kids...  Sit on your hands..  Are they there, yet?  Are they there, yet?  Are they there, yet?  Still waiting....  Are they there, yet?  Are they there?  Are they there?   Oh, they are the only Medical Doctor on Payroll to go Skiing...  Riiiiiiight.  Just so we know why New Zealanders don't have access to healthcare or medicine or justice or...  Anything.  Really.  Highest suicide rate (also 'suicide rate') there's nothing there....
    </p>

    <p>LMFAO I just read something in 'The Conversation' saying that Asian students were streamed lower in math.  Nonononononono what happened when Asian students consistently scored better in math was that math as an entire subject was devalued.  As in 'oooooooh you think you are soooooo clever you think you are smarter than us you Asian who scored 97 per cent on the math test nobody at MIT cares how high you score in math all we care about is whether you will play "I'm a barbie girl in a barbie world' in the party party party with the administration party...  Everybody knows that academic achievement isn't just about academics.  It is mostly or exclusively about being the daughter of the VC and so on...

<p>Aka.  Wake up.  There isn't any medicine.  There isn't any law.  There's nothing nothing nothing at all.  Nobody there.  Nobody home.  It all got crowded out because of various other interests had by various other 'players'.</p>

<p>Souxie Wiles...  Born in South Africa, moved to England, moved to New Zealand to become New Zealander of the year specialising in science con-munications...  Works with infectious diseases in a science laboratory (how many of your students have access to face masks working with infectious organisms in your 'science' laboratory? -- every time they do someone kills a kitten)...  Expressing an opinion on the voting in Auckland...  Or lack thereof...</p>

<p>I suppose the concern is that in New Zealand, you are supposed to have 5% of the vote in order to have any representation in parliament, at all.  But if only about 30% of the people vote...  Then if you get less than 1/6th of the votes you won't get into parliament.  The people aren't voting because they know the elections are SQuigley fixed.  So there isn't any point in voting.  Game is up.  Nasty little despot:  Win.  Democracy:  Fail.  Good job.  Well done.  Most compliant population in the world.</p>

<p>They have been consented!  They have been volunteered!  The volunteers 'found' them unconscious and volunteered them, all voluntary-like.  The laws on people having the right to refuse or opt out or off of consent to be kept in 'medical trials' (to be placed in control groups of 'no treatment' or 'do not treat' or outright torture and abuse and harm were repealed.  But it it does not matter what the laws are because they never will uphold them.  It is written into the Australiain Constitution that NZ is a State of Australia.  The Federal Government of Australia refuses to accept that, however, and refuses to allow NZ citizens to vote or work in government etc.  It does not matter what is in the Australian Constitution, in other words.  It is in the NZ Education and Training Act about the function of Universities NZ and the role of the VC of Universities NZ.  The courts refuse to uphold the law and remove someone from office who is not fulfilling their statutory function (e.g., Chris Whelan who has refused to process or progress a single complaint since he was appointed to office where his statutory function is described in law as him processing or progressing complaints so as to uphold the quality and integrity of NZ Universities.  That is or means to say the quality and integrity of NZ Universities is completely and entirely and utterly lacking, at all.  No amount of money would have got the rich kids into Universities in the US, Canada, UK, Australia...  And everybody else is expected to get in behind them, in New Zealand. </p>

<p>They intentionally try and make various things 'stupid degrees' for 'stupid people' so that the stupid people won't find them attractive and won't want to do them.  They intentionally try and market certain things as desirable for all the wrong reasons so that stupid people are attracted to those programmes.  That means that it isn't possible for people to do the programme.  That means that we don't have functioning graduates of the programmes.   </p>

<p>Then they give the titles and honors and awards to people all honorary-like.  Geoffrey Palmer was Prime Minister of New Zealand.  His son gets a (taxpayers funded?) 2 year Masters from Yale.  I don't know how much in ransom he had to pay in extra fees (library fines and the like) in order to actually graduate on time (if he did graduate on time).  But graduate he did.  I don't know how many years of NZ Government payroll Justice Palmer has received over the course of his life.  He was appointed all independent-like, of course, independence of the Judiciary and all that.  What was his thing?  He was all about how the Judicature Act was obsolete.  Archaic.  He was all about how it did (how it must  have)  no teeth.  That just is or means to say either there must be no teeth to the law (it must be washy washy so that nobody can actually be found in violation of it) else it must never be upheld.  That's right...  There isn't anything that Daddy can't do!  No impeachment for anybody in Government Jobs.  They will have to be murdered or maimed.  I mean...  At what point did the age of retirement become optional?  At what point did all of these people over 65 (in a country without the life expectancy of many developed countries or nations) get to just keep on keeping on with the payroll.  Of course, nobody questions that they are any less effective than coma patient.  Nobody questions that they aren't as competent or capable as anybody else (including their own newborns).  Anyway, there can't be any groundns to recuse Justice Palmer no matter how old he gets (that would be discrimination, I'm sure he'd have a few things to say about that).  He'd rather position himself so that he would need to be whacked  before anybody else could have a job.  That's the kiwi way, by the seems of it.  Bully  him until he volunteers to stop recieving however many hundreds of thousands of dollars of payroll.  That's what 'voluntary' looks like.  I'm sure.  What would have to happen to or with you in order for you to voluntarily give up that much money all voluntary like.  </p>

<p>No functioning education system.  No functioning health system.  No functioning judicial system.  No function.  No work.  New Zealand:  It's not working.  Nothing here.  Zero zilch zip.  Nothing to see people.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  Nothing nothing nothing by design.  5 Million people, was it?  The team of 5 million people.  That means Labor needs how many votes in order to be elected into parliament, at all?  5% was it?  Without hijacking bundles of voting papers and having certain people vote en masse.  Not a functioning democracy.  NOthing nothing nothing at all.  The waste camp detention centre of the world quite by design.  Every other nation scuttling to follow the lead example of New Zealand in the how low can we go think lower than lower than lower than lower than lower than lower than low game.  Hey, there is some nurse involved in a murdering the kids in the NICU in England.  She'd be perfect fit for the new children's hospital in Wellington -- right?  MUST HAVE.</p>
