    <p>'One of the issues which has been identified by the network is that the NCEA results in rural areas are limiting the pool of prospective students'.  https://www.odt.co.nz/opinion/editorial/rural-gp-training-proposal-welcome  They are throwing away applications is the problem.  The Education and Training Act states that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible to be enrolled in the programme they have applied for.  The 'University' then throws away applications and cries about how they don't have any.  And cries about how there are too many which is why they throw them away.  And cries about how they don't have any.  And cries about how there are too many.  Cry cry cry cry cry.  What nonsense.  They are refusing to train a new generation of GPs because new GPs will get a job only over the dead bodies of the old GPs.  The old GPs have no intention whatsoever of ever retiring.  They will work up until the day they die.  Alllllllll of the payroll for them.  Alllllll of the payroll for them.  Allllllll of the payroll for them.
