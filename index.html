                            <p>Waiting for the social security appeals authority to overturn the ministry of social development's declaration that 'justice not essential need'.  It hasn't been overturned when the substantive hearing of the issue was more than 9 months ago.</p>

                            <p>This is so that cases can be heard on appeal.  The High Court Judges were (in 2 instances) re-appointed into position from retirement.  NZ has a compulsory age of retirement for Judges and the Judges are required to get out once they hit that age.  These 'Judges' were required to have gotten out.  They were not appointed  by proper process at all, because there is no proper process for re-appointing Judges past the age of their retirement.  Why am I having to explain this?  NZ is not even trying to be rule by law, at all.  What judiciary?</p>

                            <p>The 'Universities' of NZ are not properly processing applications to enrol, graduations etc.  They refuse to comply with the education and training act. They refuse to comply with Tertiary Edcuation Commission Guidelines.  Chris Whelan is paid upwards of several hundred thousands of dollars every year to take all the complaints that he receives every year and declare each and every one of them (since he was appointed to office in about 2014) to not be a complaint of serious wrongdoing, at all.  He refuses to follow the policy that the NZVCC wrote that it would follow when it receives complaints.  He refuses to get evidence to police.  He refuses to bring issues (or allow complainants to bring issues) before the NZVCC.  Not even trying to comply with the statutory laws or government policy documents of NZ.  Judges hauled out of retirement for the occassion cannot / will not see anything wrong.  There are none so blind as those who will not see.</p>

                            <p>The Supreme Court of NZ declares that it is not a matter of public interest that NZ Universities are not properly processing applications to enrol in MBChB (Medicine) or graduate research qualifictions.  That they are keeping false records about enrolments including sending false information to the Inland Revenue Department.  Saying studnets have been enrolled in programmes they never applied to.  Refusing to get work that has been submitted for external examination out for external examination.  What Universities?  What judiciary?  WHat health system?  They aren't processing applications for Medical School.  They aren't processing graduations.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  There's nothing there.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>Poor Dr Green.  Poor Dr Leeks.  It isn't like what they were doing was any different from what any other Medical Doctor was doing.  What they ARE doing.  All of the qualities that we value.  Expedited into position quickly quickly quickly by throwing everybody else's application away.  Professor Glue's Glue Factory is the only game in town.  Declaring (particularly young females) to be treatment resistent and feeding them horse tranquilier, ketamine, LSD...  As a first treatment last resort...  Auckland busying itself manufacturing ketamine and LSD...  Anything easy and cheap.  Anything...  Abusive.  Not keeping medical records of prescribed medications.  Drugging people in the 'hospitals' and likely the prisons etc as well.  Tool for gaslighting (it's not cold!  There must be something wrong with you!  It's all in your head!)  Bullying and abuse.  Only game in town.  Everybody else's application thrown away.  Better re re re re re apply for visas, all you foreigners, so that you can come to NZ and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the 'Universities' to do anything anything anything everything Professor Glue says (in return you can do a little anything anything to the victims, no doubt, I mean who would believe them anyway)?  Right?  What health system?  What University?  What Medical SChool?  What judiciary?  Not even trying to be rule by law.  Will not properly process applications to Medicine.  Throwing the theses away.  Throwing the theses away.  Will not acnkowledge research output.  Poor Dr Leeks.  Poor Dr Green.  Poor Professor Glue.  It isn't like what they are doing is any different or any worse to anything that anybody else on payroll is doing.  NZ refused to have or allow things to be any other way.  F*cking psychopaths.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>The Education and Training Act says that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are ELIGIBLE to be enrolled in the programme they have applied to.  The 'Universities' refuse to accept this and the courts refuse to uphold the laws.  They preferentially record that teenagers (under 20) have been enrolled in Tertiary Education (often levels of debt against their name) when it is in the law books that they are entitled to a free secondary education until they are 20.  The 'Universities' throw away applications from domestic adults.  They will not do it.  They will nto process the applications to enrol.  They also will not get studnets work to external examiners.  They refuse to allow qualification completions.  They will not do it.  They record re re re re re enrolment in qualifications when the requirements for them have been met by the studnet years ago.  Decades ago, in some instances.  THey are not even trying to be an education system, at all.  HOstages.  Slaves.  There's actually nothing there.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>
