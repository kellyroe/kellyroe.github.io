 <h3>Hello World!</h3> 
                        <div id="container">

                                <p>
                                This is the first major style update of the site.  I have converted my MA Thesis into HTML.  I think I need to upload this in order to check the links. Maybe because I made them absolute rather than relative.  Hopefully this update won't break anything!  Thanks for bearing with me while I am working through readibility issues and figuring out color options. </p>
           
                                <p>You can contact me via the email address: email@kellyroe.org.
                                Yes, you probably read that correctly, 
                                my email address starts with the word "email".
                                I'll let you copy-paste that into whatever email programme you like. 
                                </p>

                                <p>Thanks for visiting!</p>

                                <p>P.S. There are two kinds of people in this world.  There are the English people.  There are the Maths people.  All of the English people aspire to do Law.  It is the head of the language hierarchy of  being.  All of the Maths people aspire to do Medicine.  It is the head of the Math/Science hierarchy of being.  But then it turns out the Maths people can retire into the arts / social sciences.  So haha fooled you into working for something that was always perceived as 'less than'.  The most important, crucial, take-home is that everybody is aspiring towards the same thing (the philandering of "Shortland Street") and therefore you aim for that and then settle for what you get.  It is important to say what the aspirational goal is quite clearly so that we can all understand what the problem is...</p>

                                <p>  Some people want to do Law because they want to be like...  And there are various things.  From Atticus to being 'Lit up' (for all those people who have felt powerless out there)...  And there are a variety of reasons to want to do Medical School, too.  From the philandering of cheap TV to other reasons.  And then there are so many other things (Engineering?  Physics?  Business?)...  Why must we micro-mismanage everything.  Oh yeah.  Because everyone wants to be Dr Leeks 2.0.  Or Dr Green 2.0.  Let's commit atrocities becuase...  We can.  Haha.  The medical version of being 'Lit up' I suppose...</p>
