                                That's about 50,000 words of research output in one year?  This is years after I give him a more than 100,000 words thesis document that he never gave me supervisory comments on and he never gave to externals to examine.  I'll just keep giving him 50,000 words of reseach every year and he can...  Reattribute authorship to others?  I'm wondering if what prompted this email was John Matthewson being credited with publication on functions.  Prior to that Fiona MacPhearson was being credited with publications on delusions.  After she was given my handouts at conference and workshop.  She told me that my work on it was her first exposure to the subject.  She asked me to get her material because we could co-author. Then she's giving talks about work she's supposedly done all by herself without referencing or acknowledging me.
</p>

<p>I did not see any of the students (not Rachel Brown, not Nick Southwood) with reports from external examiners.  I did not see either of them (or anybody else) defend their thesis publically after receiving external examiners reports.  I did not see anybody graduate.  Did anybody?  How did they decide who to publically credit with PhD?  Did they credit anybody?  Various people found their way onto payroll, allegedly or apparently.  Apparently various people are on payroll.  But I'm just expected to keep handing over my work for no pay.  What Universities?  </p>

<p>I found the following little bits.  You can really follow my CV on the 'descent into madness' or similar, that there is.  How many years of ignoring research output.  What University?  They say everybody has one book in them.  I suppose by that they mean that you kill someone (fail them out or bully them away) and you take their work as a trophy and pass it off as your own.  Right?  Just the one.  Enough for tenure.  Like how Dr Leeks was most revered for being a pedophile. Know who else is most valued?  Plagarisers.  People who will take their students work and pass it off as their own and fail their studnets else bully them into fleeing.  What University?  </p>

<p>Kim Sterelny had only a small handful of graduate research studnets.  He had no teaching.  He only had to supervise our work to completion.  ANd he takes and he takes and he takes and he takes and he takes.  And he won't (else can't) talk about any of his work that was done more than about 5 years ago.  Likely becuase..  He doesn't understand it.  He probably wasn't the author of it, at all.  I wonder if Frank Jackson was.  Or how or why he's saying that he's co-authoring various things with Kim Sterelny.  It just doesn't make any sense at all.</p>

<p>What University?  For all the EFTS of enrolment..  Australasia..  For all the studnets you claim to have enrolled in graduate research qualifications -- where is the research output?  Where the hell is it?  All the 50,000 word masters theses?  The 50,000 words of research output every f*cking year.  For how many years is someone supposed to demonstrate their capacity before they get publically acknowledged and payroll for f*cks sake.  Kim is over 65 and it's time to go.  Get the f*ck out.  You f*cking psychopath.  Get the f*ck out.</p>

        <p>The law and medicine assignments (above) make it clear they are vocational training and not academic oriented.  They won't allow you to reference properly (no direct quotation).  They want you to do what the government says when the government says because the government says.  I think they are being more blatent now about students being required to volunteer to go collect survey data etc.  Make up survey data.  Etc.  For the first year Medical Degree.  Sorry.  'Medical Degree'.  
        </p>

        <p>It's so obviously a 'I'm a gamma baby' degree.  Else...  I was picked out (all Stanford Prison Experiment, like) to be over-lord.  They have learned how you pick out a few all arbitrarily to manage the masses (in the name of trickle down economics) and, of course, with that set-up it won't take very long at all before the elite few start bashing and beating and blaming the majority for being..  Losers.  Isn't that right, Sterelny?</p>
