                                <p>
                                    I was fairly sure that Ashley Bloomfield did a MBChB BEFORE doing a...  What was that?  A 120 point 1 year Honors Programme followed by a 120 point 1 Year Research Masters?  Or was that a 120 point 1 year Honors Programme followed by a 240 point 2 Year Masters?  Maybe a 2 Year Masters comprised of 1 year of course-work followed by a 1 year thesis?  Or maybe that was 120 point 1 year Honors followed by a 120 point 1 year course-work followed by a 240 point 2 year up to 50,000 word only Masters.  Or maybe that was a 10 year Masters?  Or maybe that was a 6 year Medical Degree followed by 2 years as Junior Doctor followed by 1 year of Honors followed by...  Anyway...  Waiting for Ashley's salary reveal, now.  He was picked out all special snowflake like to do Clinical Training to actually see patients in the capacity as Medical Doctor -- right?  He was given one of the limited training places (we don't have any doctors cry cry cry we don't have any doctors who can see patients cry cry cry we don't have enough training places to train any more doctors cry cry cry no training places no doctors to see patients).  He was picked out for a limited entry training place to train to work with patients.  Before being paid off half a million dollars a year NOT to see patients.  Right?  Isn't that the basic idea...
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    I do not deny that he seemed calm and measured and those kinds or sorts of things that were rightly valued during that time.  Of course, it is easier to come across that way (to be seen to exemplify those characteristics) when one earns half a million dollars per year and when people actually listen to what it is that you have to say.  So you can just speak once.  Instead of having to say the same thing over and over and OVER AND OVER and f*cking well over again AND F*CKING WELL OVER AND OVER AGAIN JAMMING IT UP THEIR F*CKING ASSES.  I think that most people would really appreciate the luxury of not needing to bang on (and on and on and on and f*cking on...).

                                    Regarding competence...  The initial lockdown was not lawful.  But that's okay.  The laws don't seem to matter insofar as certain special snowflakes are concerned.  That's a wonderful message to be sending to the kiddies.  I didn't know that people could or would be appointed Professor (presumably in a non-honorary capacity) without a PhD.  Without extensive publications in the field.  Still...  What 'University', eh?  I mean, as head of an institution he gets to put himself down as first author on anything that comes out of the institution, I suppose.  Anything that is allowed to.  Anything that goes off to external examiners etc etc is pre-screened by Ashley.  Is that the idea/l?  I can see why they would be concerned to have a half a million dollar a year servant censoring the outputs of anything in public or population or policy or whatever it is health.  They really do need to just move it all to Massey.  Train them with the people who look after the meat and milk and racing animals.  The whole mentality around population management and so on.  Making sure the people have their shots (immunisation or euthanasia on schedule).

                                     The whole..  *Adoration* of Ashley...  Didn't anybody think that maybe it was...  Not irony, exactly...  I do wonder what his sons are doing now.  Maybe a special piece on them?  I would imagine that he's paying off Harvard or whomever millions upon millions to babysit his children.  Maybe...  Maybe they have gone off to Epstein Island for a while...  Who knows...  I do feel concerned about his children since they were forced to stay inside his home while he deeclared the whole nation unlawfully to be in lockdown with impunity or immunity.  Best do what Daddy says, eh, now.  Who'se your Daddy?  Wonder who his Daddy was for him to be picked to do MBChB in the first  place.  And why they didn't want him to be GP in the RC (Where Shane Reti was supposed to be -- his internship location...  But he's paid off, now, to not see patients.  Right?)  Ayesha...  She's paid off, now, to not see patients.  Right?
