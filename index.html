                             ...because it may help make sense of why I belabour the answering of the question and why I referenced certain things that they told me to.  Both of these were failed, in fact.  I turned up to all the classes, did all the relevant readings, made an honest attempt at an essay in `language rich' subjects.  And they failed me for my efforts.  What University?
                             </p>

                             <p>*First Year Assignments*.  The government would have us believe that the Universities are having problems they need to pass all these students who don't have basic reading.  The only kids the schools will send to Uni don't have basic reading.  They have to pass all these kids with basic reading.  But they had to fail me?  All these kids without reading and writing skills had to be given Public Health and Medical Degrees.  MD's?  PhD's?  For all their basic reading and writing skills.  Ability to follow instructions etc...  It's really not supposed to be that hard, hey.  What University?  </p>

                             <p>Who do we think failed me for my Law Assignment, particularly?  I was thinking it was most likely to be a 3rd year student or maybe a 4th year Honors student who was told to grade maybe 5 of them per hour and there was no grading meeting with a Professor to have oversight and check that they weren't failing studnets capriciously or because maybe they didn't understand what the studnets were saying.  But maybe the most likely explanation is that the Professors are determined to eliminate any potential or possible rival or competitor.  I thought that Stephen Penk was reading my Law essay and I thought he would be impressed.  Honestly. I was surprised to get less for this effort than I got for my 121G external exam.  Maybe they simply do randomise things.  Maybe they have random grading comments that are posted whether or not they apply.  I don't know what sense to make of it.  No sense.  Nonsense.  Hey.  I wish I could find the first Public Health Assignment.  You can see the gaslighting sort of nonsense coming through in the second.  Right?</p>

                             <p>Did they really make Ashley Bloomfield a Professor -- or was that fake news?  He never applied to study for MD or PhD.  He doesn't have a research output.  I'd love to read his first year essays...</p>

                             <p>_______</p>

                             <p>This site is the first webpage (or webpages) that I built.  I know it does not look particular good from modern aesthetic or design point of view.  I was mostly concerned to self-publish content that various supervisors or universities either did not get out for external examination or did not give me appropriate credit for.</p>

                             <p>I suppose also to write my perspective on the cases that I brought before the courts.  I was not litigous.  I did everything I could to have things settle without legal action.  Others decided to teach me a little lesson in how NZ is not even trying to have a functioning judiciary, or something.  I don't quite know what the point or purpose was of Quigley instructing me to initiate legal action against the University of Waikato for (1) refusing to enrol me in a programme I applied to (2) recording I was enrolled in a programme I never applied to (3) refusing to get work out for external examination (4) requesting examination for the wrong qualifiction (5) refusing to base the outcome of examination on the reports of the external examiners (6) refusing to appoint a third examiner in the case of divergent outcomes.  Just not doing any of the things that they are supposed to do when it comes to them processing graduate student research.  I suppose the idea is that it simply does not matter.  The courts won't stop them.  And now, apparently, the NZ government plans to allow them to record students being enrolled in medical qualifications.  They can put them to 'work' in the 'hospitals' in the name of their workplace internships and they can pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the 'university' until they are replaced by new students.  </p>

                             <p>And so that's what they will do, then.  Nobody else seems to have a problem with it.  Chris Whelan is both overwhelmed by complaints and also in the position where not a single person has made a complaint of serious wrongdoing about any of the 'Universities' of NZ.  </p>

                             <p>They just don't seem to be trying to be fair.  Not even a little bit.  The aim is to be a slave prison detention camp land where we lure migrants under false promises and they go away when it is time for us to pay them.  Of couse they do.  Suicide.  Are suicided.  All voluntary-like.  What Universities?  But then what health system?  What judiciary?</p>

                             <p>The whole time I was at the Australian National University (through a summer research scholarship and then however many years that they kept me enrolled in doctoral study without providing any supervisory comments on my thesis and without getting it out to external examiners) I never saw any student have a scheduled oral defence to publically defend their thesis.  I did not see any evidence at all of any student being presented with reports from external examiners offering critique of their thesis.  I don't know how the 'University' decided which studnets to give PhD's to, and when.  I don't think that they treated me fairly at all, in fact.  Anyway, I self publish the work that I did for them while I was enrolled with them beacuse I can only be responsible for the work that I did.  Various people were on payroll to supervise me.  They only had a handful of research students at any one time and they had no teaching committments to either graduate or undergraduate studnets.  The University administration was given my table of contents which informed them that I had more than 100,000 worrds of research output -- and they never contacted me about when it was going to be forwarded to externals.  I can't say that I'd recommend anybody enrol in doctoral level qualification in Australasia.  Else, if you do, plan to physically remove yourself from the environment (and cut all contact) after you have given them a doctoral thesis after 2 years of work.  Either they get it out to external examiners or you publish it yourself.  You did the work that you were supposed to do for the doctoral programme.  They payroll various people to not do any of the things that they are supposed to do.  The environment is bullying and abusive.  You don't enrol in a PhD or doctoral thesis because of the people, that's for sure.</p>

                             <p>Kim Sterelny would say that that's because it's been taken over by over taken by psychopaths.  It's soooooo competitive.  It's such a competitive environment.  People will be very horrible indeed because of the money.  Various people know that they would not be appointed into positions that they find themselves appointed into if they were not abusive bullies.  So they are abusive bullies and they find themselves the only game in town.  Nobody wanted to work with them, turns out.  All potiential rivals or competitors for funding or whatever were culled.  It isn't a collaborative environment, at all, and people aren't trying to make each other look good, at all.  They aren't even trying to behave admirably.  Certainly not with any integrity.  It isn't about the work.  It's about everything other than the work.  Bulling people into handing over work and walking away when it's time to pay them.  Then reattributing authorship to other people.  Preferably ones already on payroll, of course.</p>

                             <p>Is Kim Sterelny still affiliated with the Australian National University?  He's well over the age of 65.  Why is he still on payroll while various other people are expected to give up their incomes -- because of him.  He needs to be paid hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year (and his wife does to) so that they can refuse to supervise their students, refuse to get their studnets work out for external examination.  So they can bully and abuse their studnets and go on and on about how it's sooooo hostile it's suuuuuch a competition they aren't behavioually modern they are sooooo selfish...  Nobody else need apply, hey.  What philosophy programme?  What university?  There's really nothing of any value there.  Hey.  'Awwwwwwww, that's right' - he would say.  'Well then you turn and run away'.</p>
                            
                            <p>They liked to tell stories about how Kripke's studnets apparently loved him so much they'd carry him to class and so on.  That means that Kim gets to tell people they are required to go away on camping trips and housesit for them and feed their cats etc.  Not even the most basic level of professionalism.</p>

                            <p>And now I'm supposed to feel ashamed -- because of how unprofessionally they behaved.  That I didn't turn and walk away much much earlier.  Let the victims never stop paying for the crimes of the abusers.  They were payrolled.  They were the ones with professional obligation.  I was given a scholarship -- and I produced work.  They did not provide me with supervision, I would say.  But that's okay, I suppose, insfar as doctoral studnets are expected to be working independently, anyway.  Only the ones who are working independently in fact won't have their work sent to externals and the 'universities' won't allow externals to sign off on the completions.  Even if that means refusing to hold public defences, etc.  </p>

                            <p>Read the examiners reports of Carolyn Mason of the 'University' of Canterbury if you want to see how things are in Australasia.  She writes that she would be embarrassed to be associated with my thesis -- but what is strange is that she is not embarrassed to be associated with having said that on an external examiners report.  I suppose it was because she thought that what she was writing to me was anonymous.  She was writing under the rubric of anonymity.  But the University updated my student portal with the names of the external examiners.  So I know that she chose to write 'doctoral reports' of a masters thesis (was she paid to do the former or the latter) and then wrote that she thought it should be failed as a masters thesis without an oral defence because she already knew that I was in fact the author of it and I infact understood it.  She thinks I didn't do enough for a masters thesis?  Please show the world the masters thesis that you wrote, then, so the world can compare.  Perhaps show the world the work that you wrote over a comparable time, also, so that the world can understand why you are on payroll rather than me.</p>

                            <p>There will be a job for me only over various other people's dead bodies, apparently.  That's what people on payroll in NZ said to me since my Honors year once they started coming along to my research talks at conference.  Presently many of them are over the age of 65 and still they are on payroll.  Still.  It seems they are right. I'm just waiting for them to die, therefore, so that I can have a life.  Apparently.  Are they dead yet?  How about today?  Are they dead yet?  Apparently they would have things be no other way...  I suppose that was why they did not want me to do Medicine.  Only even that doesn't really make any sense..  I never wanted to work in aged care.  They made decisions they have made, already, about the low to no paid workers who will look after them in their old age.  The migrants who will be replaced by new migrants and the children who will be replaced by new children.  So that they can live the way they believe they are entitled to, or something.  Only them having titles, or something.  The wonderful world that they made.</p>
