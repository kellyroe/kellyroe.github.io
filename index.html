 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">

                            <p>I am working on updating this site.</p>

                            <p>I got this site up relatively quickly so that I would have a place to show my work.</p>

                            <p>You can see, from here, that I wrote a 50,000 word MA thesis for University of Waikato.</p>

                            <p>I then went to the Australian National University from 2006.</p>

                            <p>You can see the seminars I wrote and presented at conferences (write-ups are available on the seminars page, and also powerpoint presentations that I distributed printed versions of).</p>

                            <p>You can even see a more than 100,000 word thesis document that I gave to my supervisor and the university administration.</p>

                            <p>Turns out that universities get more and more and more and more money for keeping studnets re re re re re re enrolled.</p>

                            <p>I wanted to do Medicine rather than work as a Philosophy academic.  It was not enjoyable being a PhD student where my supervisor didn't actually do  his job of supervising me, at all.  What evidence do I have of that?  Well, you can see the work I did.  What work did he do?  Where is evidence of him meeting with me?  Telling me what to read?  Where are comments on my work?  When did he get my work out for external examination?</p>

                            <p>I returned to NZ because I wanted to do Medicine and go on to become a Medical Doctor.  Psychiatry, maybe.</p>

                            <p>University of Auckland told me that I needed to complete a new qualification from a NZ University.  I applied to do a 1 year MPhil with University of Waikato in 2018 (120 points MPhil with 05 March start date).  I told them I wanted to complete the 120 point 1 year MPhil in 1 year so I could study Medicine with Auckland in 2019.  The University of Waikato had a yakkity yak yak yak meeting, then, and decided amongst themselves that that was impossible.  They would not allow it.  They then refused to enrol me in the programme I applied to, enrolled me in programmes I never applied to (with very different enrolment dates over more than 1 year), refused to get work I had done out to externals, refused to allow externals to sign off on the qualification completion etc etc etc.  They ended up keeping false enrolment records and false transcripts.  They recorded that I had been failed for qualifications that I had never even applied to be enrolled in!</p>

                            <p>You can see the 14 September 2018 thesis that they never got to externals.  You can see the 05 October under 50,000 word 120 point one year 1 EFT Masters thesis that they sent out with instructions that it be externally examined as a up to 100,000 word 360 point three year 3 EFT doctoral thesis.  You can see that the examiners kept that thesis, then, though they were required to say that insofar as it was acceptable (as a doctoral thesis) it would need changes to the substance.  The Uni calendar says that when substantive changes are required before it is accepted either (1) the examiners will return the thesis and the student will have another 6 months enrolment (followed by another 3 months re-examination) else (2) the examiners will keep the thesis and the substantive changes are to be completed within 10 weeks.  The examiners kept the thesis.  Within 10 weeks I supplied the University with a 05 January 2019 version that had been substantively changed.  They refused to get that to examiners.  Within 10 weeks I also supplied the University with a 24 February 2019 version that had been substantively changed and they refused to get that to examiners.  On instructions from the Research Dean I wrote extensive commentary explaining how I couldn't make all the changes the NZ examiner (particularly) suggested since I was only enrolled in a 50,000 word 1 year MPhil and not a 100,000 word 3 year PhD.  I had done all the changes I could be expected to do within 10 weeks while keeping the document within the required length of under 50,000 words.  The University refused to get the commentary to externals. </p>

                            <p>They then kept me working for another year (another 6 months followed by another 3 month external examination) and when the overseas based external said I'd done a bunch of stuff he hadn't really asked for and asked for an oral defence they refused to schedule one and recorded on my transcript that I failed the qualification.</p>

                            <p>Meanwhile, the University of Auckland declined my application to Medicine in 2019 and again in 2020 on grounds I was 'ineligible to have applied' because they refused to accept that I'd successfully written a 120 point MPhil for Waikato in 2018.  I learned that the Education and Training Act states that domestic adults are eligible to be enrolled in whatever programme they have applied for,  by statute, however.  In other words, their decision to decline my application on grounds of 'ineligibility' was ultra vires.  They were required to process my application on the basis of it's academic merits, therefore.  They published a selection algorithm saying how full time GPA, UMAT / UCAT score, and interview score determine a ranking and places are offered to candidates on the basis of their rank order score.  They published an algorithm as to how they would calculate the full time GPA (last 2 years of graded full time study including summer school papers above stage one.  Best 120 points per year if more than 120 points per year were done).  According to this my GPA is 8.6.  They refused to calculate it correctly.  They refused to correct their wrongs.   </p>

                            <p>In both these cases (for both Universities) I exhausted internal complaints resolution process.  I also took the issue to the Ombudsman.  The Ombudsman wastes 1 year on an investigation and says a bunch of non-binding how he doesn't really see anything wrong.  The VC of Waikato told me to take them to court if I didn't like it.  I took them to court, therefore.  The University of Waikato (a public university of NZ) chose to spend tens of thousands of taxpayers dollars asserting their right to enrol students in programmes they never applied to, keep false records about them including false enrolment records and false transcripts, asserting their right to refuse to examine studnets work and arrange for them to be examined for the wrong qualification.  Auckland University (a public university of NZ) chose to spend tens of thousands of taxpayers dollars asserting their right to throw away applications to enrol from domestic adults (who are eligible by statute) on grounds of 'ineligibility' while they record increasing levels of debt against teenagers names preferentially enrolling them (since teenagers are entitlted to a free secondary education until they turn 20).</p>

                            <p>New Zealand has not paid out reparation for various cases of abuse in state care.  New Zealand does not see anything wrong with the likes of Dr Leeks abusing children in the name of psychiatry etc.  Look at all the work they do to ensure that the likes of Dr Leeks is the only game in town.  Throwing away applications from domestic adults in order to preferentially select teenagers to train them up to be the next bullies and abusers.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>It is in the Australian Constitution that NZ is a state of the Federation of Australia.  On grounds of expediency.  There has not been a vote to have NZ's status revoked.  Australia treats NZers as second or third class Australians.  I was not able to apply for Medicine in Australia because as a NZer I can only enrol in qualifications they consider 'low value' that Australians don't want to enrol in.  I can only hand over more and more and more work to the Australian National University for them to not credit me with, at all, so they can reattribute authorship of it to someone else.  So that various other people can collect up all the research funding, of course.  So they can have all of the money for not even doing their job of supervision when they don't even have any teaching requirement at all.</p>

                            <p>Corruption.  Corruption.  Corruption.</p>

                            <p>The NZ Judiciary reappointed Justice Toogood from retirement (not proper process for appointing Judges) and he couldn't see anything wrong.  Justice Fitzgerald awarded reduced costs against me for my being technically correct (in a technical matter of ultra vires decisions being made in a case of judicial review of administrative action).  Reduced costs against me for my being right.  Seriously???  They can't award me legal fees (I'm a slave to the courts) because I'm not a lawyer.  They can't award me costs because I'm not a lawyer.  They want to say (sometimes) that schedule 2B costs (for example) written into the back of the High Court Rules can only be awarded to people who have lawyers representing them.  Auckland University chooses to employ a senior partner and junior associate as well to represent them in the High Court Proceedings.  Ms Roe contacted more than 30 lawyers on the legal aid list for Auckland and they all claimed to be too busy else conflicted out else maintained that they couldn't see the merits of Ms Roe's case.  So Ms Roe is forced to represent herself.  The lengths the University of Auckland is prepared to go to in order to enrol the teenage children of the officials in the search for the next Dr Leeks.  Not even trying to be fair at all.</p>

                            <p>Ms Roe complained to the VC of the NZVCC that Waikato was keeping false enrolment records and false transcripts etc.  Chris Whelan refused to process her complaint.  He has the statutory function of processing whistleblower complaints.  Official Information Act Request shows that he hasn't processed a single complaint of wrongdoing against any of the NZ Universities since he was appointed to office in 2014.  He says he is inundated with complaints every year and he doesn't process any of them.  He has a stock standard response where he blames the complainant for having complained and he says that the problems are personal and particular to the complainant.  The High Court Judge asserted that Chris Whelan's job was actually to ensure that his statutory function is not filled by him, is not filled by anyone.  It would be ultra vires for Chris Whelan to fulfil his statutory function, asserts the High Court Judge.</p>

                            <p>Ms Roe did not get justice in the High Court.  Ms Roe therefore filed with the Court of Appeal.</p>

                            <p>The Court of Appeal says she's required to pay a total of tens of thousands of dollars security for costs so she doesn't have an 'unfair advantage' in litigation.  Ms Roe applies for security for costs to be waived since the cases she is filing are cases of judicial review of administratie action (to do with corruption within the Universities of NZ) and are matters of considerable public interest.  The Court of Appeal asserts and reasserts and reasserts that it does not see merits to the cases and that the matters are all very very very particular and very very very very personal to do with Ms Roe.  Ms Roe appeals this with the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court reasserts that there are no merits to Ms Roe's claims and things are very very very very particular and very very very very personal against Ms Roe.</p>

                            <p>Ms Roe applies for the Ministry of Social Development to provide advance benefit payment to cover the security for costs that has been set  by the Court of Appeal and upheld by the Supreme Court.  Ms Roe stated she understands there is no right to appeal in NZ, but there is the right to justice and justice has  not  been done in the High Court therefore the courts decided that an appeal was necessary.  The Ministry of Social Development declines the advance benefit payment on the grounds that the amount set by the High Court (upheld by the Supreme Court) is "too much" also on the grounds that there is no right to Justice for New Zealanders.  Ms Roe appeals this with the Benefits Review Committee which reasserts the Governments rights to deny justice to New Zealanders and Ms appeals this with the Social Security Appeals Authority.  More than 6 months later the Social Security Appeals Authority has still not issued a Judgment on whether Justice is an essential need for New Zealanders or whether Justice is simply optional or discreetionary.  The New Zealand courts still have not paid out any compensation at all to victims of abuse in State Care.  They don't think there is anything wrong with them choosing to hire people to abuse others in state care.  </p>

                            <p>New Zealand is not even trying to be fair.  Not even trying to have a university and training system.  Not even trying to have a functioning health system.  Not even trying to have a fucntioning judiciary.</p>

                            <p>AUstralia refuses to supply voting papers to New Zealanders.  Refuses to process NZers for Australian jobs (e.g., Government positions) for Australian education and training programmes (e.g., refuses HECS government loans for Medicine, etc).  Refuses to acknowledge that NZers are Australian Citizens.  Denies Australian passports and birth certificates.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>Australasia...  There's nothing here.  Garbage waste dump of a f*cking stupid-land of idiots.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>Ms Roe presents to the ED during the first Covid lock-down when the media is telling NZ that the GPs don't want to see patients because they don't have any face masks so you will need to go to the ED.  Also they are saying that nobody is presenting to the ED because people are too scared.  THey have never seen the ED so un-attended.  Ms Roe walked too much during the lock-down and ended up with an infected foot that she thought she might need antibiotics for.  She was also worried about hookworm after having walked barefooted in the Domain.  She was kept in seclusion for more than 24 hours before they got around to filling out the paperwork required for a 5 day observation hold.  Unlawfully detained without access to a lawyer, denied a phone call to police so she could inform them of her unlawful detention and get a duty lawyer.  She was kept for 5 days in the most secure environment (including unlawful use of seclusion).  Her file notes say she was forced to take prescription medication but her file notes also say that no medication had been prescribed.  She was then kept for several days after the 5 day hold expired where her file notes say that she did not want to stay so they were going to say that she was now a 'volunteer'.  That's what it means to be voluntary.  To be written up as having volunteered.  Whether you want to be or not.</p>

                            <p>Why?   Because the "hospital" gets more and more and more and more money for keeping the beds filled.  HOstages.  Slaves.  Prison.  Detention camps.  Not even trying to be fair.  What health system?  What education system? What judiciary?  There doesn't appear to be anything here.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>
