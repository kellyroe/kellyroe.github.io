                                <a href="https://kellyroe.github.io/writing/realmecv.pdf">Chronological CV</a>
                                There is a link to my CV that I have presently under consideration for various things.
                             </p>

                             <p>I will try not to do  anything to break the links.</p>

                             <p>I am file re-formatting my work.  That means the content of the hyperlinks will be replaced by the new file formatted work.</p>

                             <p>I am constructing a newer version of my CV that I will make available from here</p>

                             <p>- This is  because I have managed to locate some more work.</p>

                             <p>- It is also because I can simplify my CV by replacing 4 or 5 or 6 links to individual articles to 1 link to a collection for a year.  For example: </p>

                             <p>______</p>

                             <p>
                              <a href="./writing/ks.png">Here is an example of an email from Kim Sterelny (who will not write me a reference).</a> 

                              I collated the 'few small chunks' as he refers to them, here:
                              </p> 

                                <p><a href="./publish/2013-rep.pdf">Roe, (2013).  A few small chunks for 2013.</a>
                                </p>

                                <p>It is basically a re-write of my thesis topic, especially for him.  I re-formatted it in Word because he said he wouldn't work with .tex.  You can see how I referenced him in the middle chunk, particularly.  That was his cue to send me emails telling me what I should take out and what I should put in.  Is that how it's supposed to work?  He accepts what he says only?  I suppose that's how it is done?  Sterelny says, Sterelny, thinks, Sterelny believes.  Sterelny can tell me what my original contribution is allowed to be.  He can give it to me and I can copy-paste it into a thesis?  When?  For how many years am I to give him work, or how any years am I to do work for the University (present material at conferences etc) before they bundle it up and get it out to externals for external examination?  What University?</p>

                                <p>For how much time am I expected to arrive to the ANU to work under Sterelny's supervision before I can expect him to get to work, then?  For how long before he invited  me to a supervision meeting?  How many of those did we have in the..  How many years was I kept enrolled at the ANU Kim?  Was it 1 meeting per year or something else?  How many meetings do you count?</p>

                                <p>BEFORE I LEFT AUSTRALIA I sent him this (check his ANU inbox): <a href="./writing\doctoral.pdf"> Over 100,000 words of doctoral thesis.</a> He gave me NO COMMENTS on it.  NO FEEDBACK.  AND HE WOULD NOT SEND IT OUT TO EXTERNALS.  Years later I get my student records from the ANU and there is  note from him asserting that I sent him 50,000 words (only) and it should be done in 3 months (therefore 3 months more money for the Philosophy Programme for keeping me re-enrolled so he gets more money for pretending to supervise me).  If he wanted to see 50,000 words from me (only) he should have asked for my words in 2006.  If he wanted 100,000 words (only) he should have asked for my words as at end of 2007.</p>

<p>I did not see any of the ANU students with reports from external examiners.  I did not see any ANU students give a public oral defence of their thesis in response to the reports from external examiners.  Public oral defences should have been publically advertised.  I simply don't believe that various people had public oral defences without my knowing about them.
</p>

<p>How are other students claiming to have PhD's from the ANU?

<p>
    Let me see their work over their comparable enrolment period.</p>

<p>  I don't understand.  </p>

<p>I guess the idea was that various people really really really really wanted to be philosophy academics.  Sooooo much more than me.  They just loved going along to `work' every day and eating their lunch with their friends.</p>

<p>How does Ashley Bloomfield get hired to be Professor when he never applied to be enrolled in PhD, never wrote a PhD, does not have any research output?  How does Jacinda Ardern get 3 fellowships at Harvard because she wants to write a book.  Why won't they hire someone who has already written a book ffs?  I guess she's a former politician so she can help them figure the logistics of breeding real knock-out babies in NZL to populate their under-ground bolt-holes, or similar.  Only the best and the brightest send their kids to Harvard to eat their lunch with Jacinda, obviously.  What Universities?  There's nothing there.</p>

<p>It's just a delay tactic to delay people from having a payroll.  That's all there is to it.  There's no positive reason to go to University.  There isn't anything there.   </p>

<p>The people they choose to payroll laugh and joke about how it's all about `bums on seats' and about `keeping the bums on the seats' for as many years as possible.  Keeping the low-valued individuals delayed and detained and post-poned.  Keeping them poorly in `Universities'.  Treating them like sh*t, generally.  Sterelny was a singularly unpleasant individual, for example.  It's sooooo competitive.  It's sooooo hostile.  It's sooooo important for my career to go away on camping trips and go along to `University' and pretend to have fun eating and drinking with various people.  That's why we go to University, clearly, so we can go to lunch.  There's nobody home.  Nothing there.  They aren't processing the academic work.  There's nothing there.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

<p>And now Sterelny's over 65 and he's still on payroll?  Well, that's special.  However many people can just die, already, they are losers.  They lose.  Haha.  However many over 65's don't feel like giving up their payroll.  </p>

<p>Most of the people on payroll at insittutions whose `primary function is reasearch' don't do any f*cking research.  Where's your research output Ashley?  Where's your research output Jacinda?  You are supposed to be on payroll to..  To, what?  To teach from your research?  What are you going to teach?  Teach the kiddies that if they are appointed leaders in NZ they can do anything anything anything the laws don't apply.  The courts will punish anybody who complaints that the leaders aren't following the laws that the leaders wrote for the leaders to follow.  No private language.  Garble garble garble no private laws.  No speak the english.  There's nobody home.  Nothing there.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  Just another institution of abuse.  Who do you payroll?  The most qualified person for the position?  Where is the research output that qualified the person for the position, then?  Where is the research output?  </p>

<p>Chat GPT can make one.  Google.  Just type a sentence into google (maybe one you found) and see who Google tells you to reference.  That's a great idea.  Let's see if people can tell the difference between a computer generated research output and that of a person.  What's that, Sterelny?  If  million monkeys typed for a million years..  Hey, I know, just get all your studnets sending you their work (uploading to Turnitin) else submitting to made-up journals.  Then reattribute authorship to various people already on payroll.  Maybe reattribute a book to Jacinda!  She needs a book to be attributed to her now she's supposedly a research fellow of Harvard!  Better find her one and get busy writing her teleprompts for her lectures.  Or maybe she can just spend all day showcasing fashion gowns and everyone will turn up to eat lunch with her all voluntary-like so she can tell them about how corrupt everything is in NZL and at Harvard etc etc.  There's nothing there.</p>

<p>What University?  There's nothing there.  Just another government institution of abuse.  What a f*cking scummy scummy scam.</p>

<p>All these people over 65 and they won't get out.  They are supposed to stop getting government handout payroll's when they turn 65 and they won't stop paying them.  Various other people (me) expected never to have payroll because these over 65 psychopaths won't give up their camping trips and their lunches etc.  F*cking psychopaths.  Get the f*ck out.  Hurry up and die, already.  F*cking psychopaths.  What the f*ck did you expect me to do?  HOw the f*ck did you expect to treat me?  You expect me to just f*cking f*ck off and die so that you can live the life you think you are entitlted to.  F*cking psychopaths.  What philosophy is there in the philosophy programme?  There's nothing there.  Party party party party party dinners and drinks and camping trips.  What job in philosophy?  There's nothing there.  Where is the philosophy?  Where is the academic research?  Where are the reports from external examiners?  Where are the oral defences?  What University?  There's nothing there!   You wouldn't f*cking well acknowledge the work that various people did.  You wouldn't f*cking pay them.  Alllll the money for Sterelny so he can fly about the world party party party party party.  Allllll the money for Sterelny and his f*cking camping trips.  What philosophy?  What jobs in philosophy?  What university?  There's nothing there ffs.  There's nothing there.</p>

<p>How is anybody claiming to have a PhD from the Australian National University?  There were no reports from external examiners and there were no oral examinations or defences.  No academic work or activitites were being done.  Various people on payroll supposedly or allegedly or apparently for university support service types or kinds or sorts of things...  To do what?  To help students get their work to externals?  What help?  To help them apply for employment?  I don't understand how some studnets from the ANU went into paid university employment positions.  Fellowships and so on.  Post-docs.  How they got tentured places.  How did the ANU hire Nick Southwood and Rachael Brown, for example, when neither of them had oral defences or reports from externals examiners.  Why is Kim writing them references when he won't write me a reference?  Martin Davies wouldn't write me a reference. Who doesn't write referencees for people who did the f*ckign work?  What did they have to do to get references?  They were psychopathic enough to pretend to loooooove the camping trips?  Maybe they actually loved being Sterelny's little b*tch, or similar.  What University?  There's nothing there.</p>
