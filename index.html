                            <p>Maaori culture outside New Zealand.</p>

                            <p>The New Zealand Government likes to tell a story whereby leaving NZ means turning your back on Maaori culture.  But the thing is, it doesn't have to be that way.  One of the themes that comes through is that the Maaori people were great voyagers.  They navigated the globe.  Who says that their final resting place or position needs to be New Zealand?  Extinction strategy.  Extermination path.  The Government takes control of the Maaori language (deciding who and what is authorative when it comes to pronounciation and grammar and even what you are and are not allowed to say).  I strongly suspect that the only way for the Maaori culture to flourish and thrive is if many of the Maaori actually do up sticks and move away.  I mean...  What happened to the Irish people and the Irish famine and all that.  Many of them left.  Moved to America, or whereever.  Because there wasn't a way of life for them in Ireland.  They were literally being starved out. </p>

                            <p>I think things have taken a dive in Australia since I was there.  Certain people were moved to Australia.  Dr Leeks.  He really really made it.  Was relocated to Melbourne with full honors and awards.  He was most desirable.  Harlene Hayes.  After the number she did on Otago.  Not graduating the Medical Students so the University of Otago could grubby grub up more money for re-enrolment and re-enrolment and re-enrolment.  She's gone off to do the same for Western Australia -- right?  Having the 18 year old teenage children of this and that administrator and official gifted places in the Medical Training Programme despite their rank order score on the basis of who their parents are.  To send them forth to practice their skills on the 'other'.  See how many they can kill.  Right?  Wrongful death.  Dr Leeks 2.0?  The glorious and magnificent Kim Sterelny.  I don't think he writes half of what he's been credited with in print.  Right?  How about many of his graduates?  The ones he says did enough for their PhDs?  How many of them actually had work they wrote themselves sent out for external examination?  Any of them?  Did any of them get back reports from external examiners?  Any of them at all?  Is he dead yet?  Good grief...</p>

                            <p>Australia did not treat me very well when I was there in Australia...  Though...  Mostly that's Kim Sterelny and the awful people in the Philsophy Programme.  Apparently it's soooooooo competitive.  Says Sterelny.  And various of his studnets say it's not about who does the work -- it's about who gets credit for having done it at the end of the day.  So they get all of the credit and all of the pay.  And nobody seem to care at all about putting things right for me.  F*cking psychopaths.  There's actually  nothing of any value there.  NO values.  Not so far as I can see.</p>

                            <p>The Australian National University only last year refusing to process an application to enrol, from me.  They say my application was 'incomplete' but that was false.  Sterelny refuses to write me a reference.  Refuses to be a referee.  I work with him as my named supervisor for how many years?  For how many years and he won't even acknowledge my work output.  I give him 100,000 words + and did he even read it?  Where is the evidence of him having read it?  Did he get it to externals?  Where is the evidence of him having got it to externals.  He says it's sooooo long ago he doesn't even remember.  I am supposed to give up my life so he can keep on taking all the payroll to go off on family holidays.  Is he f*cking well dead yet?  Oh God, I hope so.  So that someone else can live, for a change.  F*cking hurry up and die you f*cking prick.  Worst Supervisor Ever.  F*cking c*nt (that's what he'd say -- right?)  F*cked the dog you f*cking c*nt.  Everybody who knows him knows...  He was a real quality hire for the ANU.  I see why he's a member of whatever academy of this and that and the other.  See who Australia chooses...</p>

                            <p>The idea, of course, is that the best of the Australians pay however many hundreds of thousands of dollars to expediate their kids into the USA.  So they need to replace their children with NZers, I guess.  What's that?  Best place in the world to churn out people you can treat as children forever...</p>

                            <p>________</p>

                            <p>Oh, hey, I'm sooooooo glad that I left Australia to come back to NZ to pursue entry to Medical School with Otago or Auckland because I was a NZ citizen (and not Australian, apparently) which meant NZ was supposed to have 'first dibs' on me, or something...  Only Otago and then Auckland thought I was garbage garbage garbage...  That's right..  The Australain National University would only accept garbage garbage garbage in their top world 3 Philosophy of Mind Programme...  I'm garbage garbage garbage.  Clearly.  Can't do a 1 year level 5 sport and exercise science program at WELTEC. That's me.  Garbage garbage garbage.  Can't do a 1 year 120 point 1 EFT MPhil with Uniersity of Waikato. Garbage that's me.  Who wants to stay in NZL..  Voluntarily???  All voluntary-like???  I don't even have entry to MBChB (an undergraduate level degree).  Garbage garbage is me.  All make way for Dr Leeks 2.0!!!!!!!!!!!! Heil!!!!!!! All Heil!!!!!</p>

                            <p>I'm sorry... Shout out to the sport and exercise science tutors at Weltec.  Jenny.  Phillip.  Che???  OMG..  WTF... You guys are actually doing the teaching...  Day to day...  And you don't even have personal homepages within the organisation.  But you guys are the rock stars.  Honestly and truely.  Your knowledge and expertise and social skills (looking at you partiticulary che..  I can't even find your website..  wtf...)...  You guys are awesome.  I don't begrudge any of you at all.  I learned so much...  But when do I get recognition for even having seen that potential in you???  I'm not supposed to go to 'work experience' because..  I don't get to have a job in the field because... Of uh..  Well what job am I supposed to have, then???  WTF...</p>

                            <p>  https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/131834539/australia-to-let-kiwis-become-citizens-after-four-years-in-major-policy-shift  Some movement in the right direction.  Since it is in the Australian Constitution that NZ is a State of the Federation of Australia, and all.  Who knows what the consequences would be if they told NZers that they were Australian's now, living under Australian Federal Law...  Who knows..  It would all be a bit much, really, were it to happen overnight.  So...  A somewhat feasible pathway to residency.  And they can always simply say the NZers failed the citizenship test for whatever made-up reason.  They failed the test.  No speak Australian.  Whatever.  But yeah...  It doesn't really do for NZ to try and keep people enslaved without any qualifications for the work they have done, without any pay.  Just expect to record levels of debt against their name, cast aspersions on their character etc etc in order to keep them slaving as domestic slaves with no alternative.  Aiming and aspiring to be the last resort garbage land that nobody would voluntarily choose to live in.  Living under the thumb of 65+++ year olds who refuse to pay anybody else and refuse to f*cking well die already and get out of the f*cking way.  </p>

                            <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/488410/otago-university-just-doesn-t-have-any-financial-resilience-union  They refuse to supply applications to enrol to candidates who are declared to be eligible (by statute) so that they can enrol teenagers (who are eligible for free secondary schooling until they turn 20).  Cry cry cry we don't have more enrolments.  They are throwing away applications to enrol from domestic adults.  Cry cry cry they don't have any enrolments.  They are throwing away applications to enrol from people who are eligible to be enrolled *by statute*.  Beyond stupid. </p>

                            <p>So, I filled out the Census forms.  One for my individual dwelling, and one for my person.  I put them in the same envelope and posted them off.  Done.  Now they tell me they received my individual dwelling form, but not my person one.  So...  I think the government has taken to throwing away the person ones.  Just throwing them away.  Then saying they didn't receive them.  Then however much money isn't going to communities (where is it going to instead?) because they refuse to acknowledge they have received Census forms.  Sounds like them.  Can't do, won't do, a Census...  </p>

                            <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/488260/a-lot-to-say-for-this-system-coordinated-training-programme-for-junior-doctors-to-be-implemented  Automaton.  No informed consent.  No internship at all.  Supply them the informed consent forms by automaton and get out of the f*cking way.  We dont' have an education and training system.  Get out of the f*cking way.  Get out of the f*cking way.  Get out of the f*cking way.  There' snothing here.  Out the awy.  Get out.  Get out.  Are you dead yet?</p>

                            <p>What is Peter Crampton doing now?  Throwing away applications to work as a health professional for a DHB or for the National Health System, now.  That's his forte -- right?  To throw away applications from people who are qualified so as to ensure that the Dr Green and Dr Leeks and so on are the only people deployed onto those positions.  So that they can comit atrocities against the NZ people.  What health system?  What education and training system?  Doesn't matter what any of the laws because there is not a functioning judiciary.  More than 4 months since a substantive hearing in the Social Security Appeals Authority and no judgment output.  No judgment output.  Extensions of time for MSD so they can hire lawyers for themselves.  Extensions of time for the MSD.  No judgment output from the courts.  No justice in the High Courts of NZ.  Won't do it.  Lawyers are not awarded legal fees from the courts.  Ms Roe is required to slave for the courts.  Refile your refiling of the refilings MS Roe.  Else we won't progress your filings.  Refile the filings of the filings slaev for t he courts Ms Roe.  Reduction in costs awarded against you for your being techincally right in a technical matter.  What justice?  What judiciary?  Nobody  home.  NOthing there.  It is in the AUstralian COnstitution that NZ is a state of Australia and they keep NZ as as slave prison detention camp only.  NObody home.  Nothing tehre.  Not even trying to be fair at all.</p>

                            <p>Before Covid I remember reading about how people in apparently highly desirable jobs were smearing faeces on the wall at work.  CE's were complaining about how their workers were eating their lunches in the toilet stalls and smearing faeces on the walls, and such.  Do you think that that kind of behavior is something that happens when people are in healthy office working environments?  People were f*cking miserable.  A lot of them.  The bullies love it, of course.  You can see them...  Poncing about the libraries at University 'all eyes on me!  all eyes on me!  all eyes on me!' like they've been trained in the private boarding schools to supervise the students below them in their afterschool study, or whatever, and they are used to lording it above the students just beneath them and if you don't like it they can cover your head with a bag and beat you.  That kind of a wonderful happy healthy workplace.  </p>

                            <p>You don't have to worry about the bullies taking your work output and running away with it claiming it as their own when the bullies can't see you working and take it from you.  You don't have to worry about people bullying you at lunch time etc so you need to hide on the toilet stall if you want any away from people time if you are working from home.  Unless the bullies are keeping you in their houses, of course.  Or cramped however many people to a bedroom to afford their rent in their rental properties.  You can see who the actual workers are when it comes to working from home.  Not everybody is a benign slacker like..  What's his name from "Silicon Valley".  The nice guy who failed his way up to VC of Stanford.  Benign happy to work from work guy.  Unlike the many toxic people who need to work from work because they don't actually do any work.  They thrive on beating on the younger ones.  Preventing and prohibiting the actual work from being done.</p>

                            <p>Where is the University of Waikato's research output?  Mind you, the AUstralian National University doesn't seem to be acknowledging ressearch output from it's studnets in more recent years.  In fact...  I don't see any evidence that any of their research students work was actually sent out for external examination at all.  Some people were credited as having done enough for PhD's and research was attributed to their name.  I'm not sure what evidence there is or was that it was primarily their own research output, at all.  Version control management software woudl make their own personal contributino to it clear.  And when it was produced as a measure of whether they were doing enough work.  Or whether it was about who was attending morning and afternoon tea.  Who was typing together.  And so on.  I guess there would be reports from external examiners if there were reports from external examiners...  Auckland says they own the reports and they don't give them to students.  That makes me wonder if Auckland has any external examiners reports at all, as well.  Nothign there hey.  What reseach output?  Waiting for the slackers to be fired.  Best case.  Die, worst case.  They reckon it will come down to over their dead bodies.  THey have tenture.  Jobs for htem for life.  So many other people can just f*cking die for all they care.  So they can f*cking slack and teach high school curriculum contents in the 'universities' to people who will die before they will say they've done enough for completion fo graduate research since the people on payroll to supervise are likely incapable of that level themselves.  That seems to be the pre-requisite for why they are hired.  Chris Whelan is..  Well, either too f*cking stupid to do the job of taking the complaint and hitting 'forward' so it goes to police / is scheduled for meeting of the NZVCC.  A computer could do a better job of it.  How much money would it cost to get someoen to write a f*cking script to hit 'forward' on the emails going in to his outbox?  He's on hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.  I jsut saved the governmetn.  You are welcome.  The problem isn't that there isn't enough money.  The problem is corruption.  Stupidity.  Corruption.  Stupidity.  Corruption.  The courts can't even spit ta f*cking judgment out 3 months post hearing.  F*cking corruption.</p>

                            <p>That is actually what they need to do in academia.  Use version control management software (e.g., have students do their work in Git and Github or whatever).  So that you can see who does the actual f*cking research work.  See who the workers are.  Pay your workers.  And so you can automate release dates.  When is the work due?  The deadline?  The version that there is on release date is the version that is released.  It's not that f*cking hard.  What is the hold up?  Too busy slacking...  All the f*cking slackers...</p>

                            <p>It takes the applications that have been received by the application deadline and it processes them according to academic merits.  A computer could be programmed to do it.  You don't need a meeting of slackers where each of them is paid hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to yakkity yak yak yak about how they aren't going to select students on the basis of academic merits and you can't make them.  It takes the enrolment start date (that was stated on the application that was recived by the application deadline) and it spits out a thesis submission date.  So that the project the student applied to be enrolled in can be completed in a timely fashion.  A computer could do it.  You don't need to pay people hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to call meeting after meeting after meeting after email after email refusing to accept that 1 year of work should be completable in 1 year.  A computer could do it.  All of the f*ckign slackers on payroll.  Automaton would be better.  What do the people on payroll do to help the work get completed to a high standard?  Do they do more or less than what a computer can do with a f*cking spell checker?  Automaton.  Why are they on hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to prevent and prohibit the timely production of research output?  THey may make lovely secondary school teachers of secondary school level content.  But they aren't producing any research.  They don't have research output.  Chris is typing..  Amy is typing.  Chris and Amy are typing..  Let's go to school so we can eat our lunch together.  Let's go to school so we can meet up for morning tea.  Let's have a meeting!  Let's put on our fancy suits and make sure there is no research output at all.  What University?  

                            <p>These toxic bullying government institutions of abuse...  Do you think the studnets are more or less likely to experience the abuse at it's worst if they are required to go in in person to in person meetings where they are called into meetings with no witnesses..  Or if they are working remotely or by distance.  I have posted on my website emails that various people from the Univesrity of Waikato have sent me.  Telling me I'm not allowed to complete  1 year of work in 1 year and so on.  I can tell you it is vastly worse in person when they call you in to tell you to your face (behind closed doors) how garbage you are and how there will only  be a job for you over their dead bodies etc etc.  We know I wrote my work myself (I didn't plagarise it or thieve it from someone else) because we have the version control software that the people on payroll pretend to be too f*cking stupid to use.  Where are the changes they suggested to my work?  What was their contribution to it?? What concrete changes did they provide?  Did they help the work be better or merely different?  THink of the increase in productivity, the increse in research output that would come out of f*cking firing their stupid arses (put them on disability if they are incapable, put them on unemployment if they would be better suited to a different kind of work..  Maybe teaching secondary students secondary student curriculum if they aren't willing or able to keep up a research output)..  Automaton would be more helpful than them.  They couldn't proof things for typos with a submission date that I informed them of months and months and months in advance.  The submission date should have been spat out the f*cking computer when I was enrolled by the f*cking computer after the f*ckign computer received my application to be enrolled by the application deadline.  They can't do it / they won't do it.  WHy the bloody hell are they on payroll when they don't have a research output?  How much research work do they do every year?  Nothing.  I tell you what...  There's nothing here.  F*cking freeriders.</p>

                            <p>What is the outcome of the investigation into the legality of the war over in the Ukraine?  Does it come down to who started it?  I think...  I am remembering reading an article that said that some people in the Ukraine shot down an airplane.  That was the start of things.  If that was true and right...  Whose airspace was the aircraft in when it was shot down?  Was it actually in Ukraine terrain else did Ukraine shoot down an aircraft outside of the Ukraine.  In a sort of 'the best defence is an offence' kind or sort of situation?  Well then who gave the order for them to shoot the plane down?  That's who started it.  Right?  How is the investigation coming along?  Now now..  A whole bunch of world leaders are invested in their being war in the Ukraine for a whole bunch of reasons.  NZ's interest will be in trying to muster a draft, if possible.  To ship as many NZers off to die as possible.  We don't get submarines, however.  We can't just sink them under the sea on their way out of NZ...  Just walk away from the women and children.  We've got them, don't worry about that...  Just hand over all your stuff and walk off to die, now, thanks very much.  Justice Toogood has decided he wants to keep being payrolled for another 40  years so we aren't going to pay you...  Thanks for all the unpaid slave work you did.  Time to die now.  Thanks.  Ta.  Go on Chris, see if you can muster international enthusiasm for a draft from NZ...  See if people will go off all voluntary-like from Secondary School.  See if you can ship the 18 year olds off in the name of unpaid internship so you can have the life you believe you are entitlted to (twice the life, right Justice Toogood?).  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>Bell Gully..  Thompkins Wake..  I forget who the University of Auckland payrolled to do their filings.  Both of those firms were hired by someone, though.  Was it Chris Whelan to defend his entitlement to write off every single complaint he has received as a 'personal problem' of the student instead of following the policy and procedure that he wrote to uphold NZs international obligation to protect whistleblowers.  Since, you know, we don't just want to curb and kill the *perception* of wrongdoing in NZ Universities..  We actually want to ensure that there isn't any serious wrongdoing going on.  No?  That's not his Statutory responsibility?  Actually his job is to ensure that NZ never meet any of our international obligations (what are they going to do about it?  Weather bomb us?  Hahahahaha you and whose army?  What are they going to do?)...  I guess he wouldnt' have been payrolled otherwise...</p>

                            <p>I wonder a bit what is going on in the world, internationally, in IT.  If they are paying the workers (now that they can identify the workers via version control management software) and the Slackers are all being let go..  Else if the children of the administration who were cheated into the Public Schools of California (when their parents could have full fee paid their way through Stanford) and the like... The boys can take sports scholarships to play on the women's team, or whatever... In the name of transgender equity the children of the administration can take up all the training places...  Are being payrolled to micromismanage the administration of the marketing team of Slackers or whatever...  The bloat.  Bloatware.  Hundreds of thousands of dollars to them to be payrolled until, finally, automaton.  Go DevOps...</p>

                            <p>  https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/131788981/can-one-less-student-make-a-difference-teachers-respond-to-smaller-classes  What?  You are going to actually acknowledge that certain people have completed their teacher training and you are actually going to payroll them to work as teachers?  God no.  That's now how it works.  You don't acknowledge that they have graduated and you record only ever increasing levels of debt against their name while you put them to work as unpaid student interns teachers aides teachers assistants while they pay the university they pay the university they pay the university they pay the university.  Paying teachers for having completed their teacher training?  That is not how we do.  There aren't enough teachers!  We will have to re-enrol and re-enrol and re-enrol and re-enrol people into teacher training (whether they apply to the programme or not -- right, Justice Toogood?  The University of Waikato can record that studnets (e.g., Kelly Roe) is enrolled in a program of study *even when the student never applied to be enrolled in that program of study*.  Send the bill to the IRD For student fees *for programmes of study that the student never even applied to be enrolled in*.  Right, Justice Toogood?  What education and training system...</p>

                            <p>  https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/300855134/god-help-us--waikato-hospital-short-40-nurses-for-one-shift  How many "healthcare assistants" were there?  How many students who were enrolled in nursing qualifications (who had been re-enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled in nursing qualifications because nobody is ever going to sign off on them having completed their nursing training) were in the hospital?  Nurses don't actually do any of the things that were mentioned in the article -- right?  Unpaid voluntary nursing students do those things in their role as "healthcare assistant" for low to no wages.  For decades..  Right?  You won't sign off on completion of their training because then they would leave.  Right?  Since you aren't going to pay them they would pack up and move someplace where they would be paid.  Australia, maybe.  Else (worst case) they would apply for paid work in NZ which would mean that some other nurses out there wouldn't get so much over-time.  Over-time pay.  And so on.  Wouldn't be such a small exclusive group anymore.  Wouldn't get to feel so...  Powerful.  It's a certain special type of power, I suppose.  Feeling like that's how valuable you are.  How scarce.  </p>

                            <p>That was something that many medical people say.  Those of them that were graduated, however many decades ago.  That they were very young indeed (early 20's) when they were graduated and shipped off to some rural community where they would be the only doctor in town.  Or sometimes some rural hospital where they may be the only doctor on during the night, or whatever.  So no supervision.  Just get in there and have a go.  And you make mistakes.  Of course you do.  And you have to live with that and those.  I guess many people burn out.  Those who don't burn out have come to terms with getting in there and having a go and so on.  And they are determined that insofar as they actually play a role in the training of the new generation they will be complicit in their crimes.  There is that, I suppose.  When various people have been..  YOu know..  NOt washing their hands properly for years.  Not getting informed consents.  Overmedicating their patients.  All those sorts or kinds of things.  THey will only sign off on a new generation who is similarly implicated.  They get them writing all about the atrocities they are required to perform during their training in their ethics class.  Don't they?  Documenting their own crimes...  To normalise it.  So the law courts can go 'this is just how we do.  This is the kiwi way.  Only game in town'.</p>





                            <p>Transgender Athletes</p>


                        <p>

                        “I’m pro transgender having their own class to compete in. I want them to win medals. I want them to participate in sport. I’ve got nothing against them. I’m pro biological women not having to compete against transgender [women]...  “I believe in supporting biological women … who aspire to win anything in sport. They will eventually lose everything to men wanting to be women.”  -- Dale Shephard.  NZ Powerlifter.  From:  https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/other-sports/300855409/governing-body-denies-male-powerlifter-entry-into-womens-competition</p>

                        <p>I'm not entirely sure about the 'men wanting to be women' characterisation...  But I agree with everything prior to that 100 per cent.  I was really really surprised to learn that Serena Williams wouldn't even be in the top 100 for tennis if there wasn't a womens's division, specifically.  If women who have gone through puberty as male (with male associated changes to bone density and frame and muscle mass) are directly competing against women who have gone through puberty as female (with associated changes to the shape of the pelvis and movement of bones and menstrual cycles) then it won't be very long at all before the transgender women are winning everything and displacing the females. </p>

                        <p>Once upon a time in the history of women's sport it was hard to get enough competitors for a competiton.  Maybe it is still the case.  Difficult for there to be weight class matched boxing or MMA or women's weightlifting events etc.  I reckon transgender athletes are in a similar position where we don't have transgender classes, yet, so that transgender athletes can compete against each other.  Maybe one day develop even to the point of when people transitioned, or whatever.  Different divisions.  To make things fairer.  More inclusive.  More of an interesting competition because things are evently matched.  A fair fight.  Do we still like for things to be fair?  Unclear...  I thought NZ was about the underdog but the attitude we get about the All Blacks being the best and that's why we love them seems to attest to otherwise.  People don't have a problem with jumping on the bandwagon of supporting the obvious winner.  I guess compensation for being kicked around so many other aspects or areas of life.  Have to take what you can get.  Sigh...</p>

                        <p>It is kind of interesting how different sports have gone different ways on it.  I guess in athletics and swimming there is recognition that puberty is really important.  Guys get a dramatic increase in performance.  Women don't.  They get worse for a time.  Many women feel demoralised over the drop in performance and drop out of sport altogether.  It sucks when you aren't as streamlined anymore because of your new shape.  It sucks when your pelvic bones start moving around so you have core instability and can't handle or drive your legs properly anymore.  Traditional ways of dealing with it were to starve them and put them on the pill and so on and keep training them as deficient boys, as much as you can...  Times are starting to change..  But, yeah...  </p>

                        

                            <p>______</p>

                            <p>Landon Watt in his capacity as legal advisor, office of the vice chancellor, university of auckland, informs me by email that the university of auckland spend $86,318.50 (including disbursements and GST) to hire external legal counsel for Roe v University of Auckland legal proceedings.</p>

                            <p>In the first case management conference for the above proceeding, Ms Roe pointed out to the 2 judges who were present that the Univesrity of Auckland had missed a filing deadline and she requested that judgment proceed in their absense.  That would  have saved the Univesrity $86,318.50 in legal fees.  The Judges who were present chose to grant the University an extension of time so that they could employ external counsel.  That was supposedly or apprently in the interests of Justice, the courts decided.  The courts decided to schedule a half day proceeding so that the University could asssert it's right to throw away applications from domestic adults even though the education and training act declares domestic adults to be eligible by statute.  The University published selection criterion (full time GPA, UMAT / UCAT Score, interview score) but refused to offer Ms Roe a place (or not) on the basis of her rank order score.  They said she was 'ineligible to have applied' and simply threw her application away. That was so that they could preferentially select teenagers and record levels of university debt against their name since the teenagers are entitlted to a secondary level education for free until they turn 20.  NZ doesn't have an education and training system.  Not even trying to be fair.  NZ doesn't have a functioning judiciary.  Not even trying to be fair.  Ms Roe doesn't 'get a discount on the amount awarded against her for Ms Roe being technincally right'.  Ms Roe is technically right in a technical matter of the University's decision to refuse to enrol her being ultra vires.  They were required to apply their published selection algorithm to her application and offer her enrolment if (and only if) her rank order score was high enough for selection.  They aren't being fair in how they are deciding who to enrol or not.  I don't know how much money people like Dr Leeks pay to do anything anything anything they like in our hospitals etc.  I would imagine considerably more than $86,318.50.  But the University behaving ultra vires has been upheld by the court.  The courts have chosen to give teeth to the Univesrity acting ultra vires.  What University?  What health system?  What education and training system?  What judiciary?  There's nothing here.</p>

                            <p>I am currently unemployed.  If you have a position suitable for someone with my level of education (you can see that I did the work for various qualifications whereas various other people on payroll didn't do the work for which they are paid - most minimally getting my reseach work out to externals so that they can sign off on completion fo my research qualification in a timely fashion).  https://www.payscale.com/research/NZ/Degree=Philosophiae_Doctor_(PhD)/Salary  Apparently NZ just keeps on needing to payroll new people from overeas (and people from NZ who didn't enrol in or do the work for these qualification) because they simply refuse to acknowledge the people in NZ who did apply to do the work and who did do the work.  Where is my government payroll?  Where is it?  Where is my money?  I was prepared to re-invest in further education..  But the government can't comprehend.  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camps.  Where is my money?  Only language y'all understand.</p>
                    
                        <p>These webpages document research that I have done for various Universities of NZ, Australia, USA.  Masters theses (MA and MPhil) and Doctoral thesis (PhD).  Also various graduate level course-work and write-ups of conference and seminar proceedings.  Articles.  A book chapter (co-authored).
                        </p>

                        <p>Much of that work that was given to supervisors and university admninistration was never sent out for external examination.  Supervisors didn't get comments back to me and didn't get it out to externals if they were too busy else lazy to do their job supervising me, so that externals could make concrete suggestions for changes else sign off that I had done enough for the 1 year masters or the 3 year doctoral programme that I had applied to be enrolled in.  The Universities kept recording re-enrolment and collect more and more money for keeping me re-enrolled.  Kept collecting more work from me.  Kept recording me as being re-enrolled.  The Universities aren't allowing externals to sign off on completion of research degrees.</p>

                        <p>I returned to New Zealand thinking that it didn't matter so much if the Australian National University wasn't going to send my thesis out for external examination, because I wanted to study Medicine and apparently it is competitive selection on the basis of full time GPA, primarily.  I thought with a GPA of excess 8.0 (actually 8.6 according to University of Auckland published criterion on how they will calculate it for the purposes of selection to Medicine) I had a pretty good chance.  But turns out that they aren't making decisions on the basis of GPA, at all.  They declared me 'ineligible to have applied' and they refused to correctly enter my GPA into their selection algorithm and offer me a place in the MBChB programme (or not) on the basis of my rank order score.</p>

                        <p>This website documents various cases that I have brought before the courts of New Zealand, therefore.  Auckland and Otago are not selecting people to MBChB on the basis of their academic GPA.  They are throwing away applications from domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years (who are eligible, by statute) in order to expediate selection of teenagers.</p>

                        <p>The statutory law of NZ says that NZ citizens are entitled to a free secondary school education until the age of 20.  When they turn 20 they are eligible to be enrolled in the tertiary programme they have applied to.  But the Universities are throwing away applications from domestic adults so they can record levels of debt against the name of the teenagers.  Often enrolling teenagers in only secondary level courses (partiuclarly in maths and science subjects at University).  Taking them out of secondary schooling in order to record levels of debt against their name.  Throwing away applications from domestic adults.</p>

                        <p>New Zealand is presently hearing cases of abuse in state care.  Not only are the courts delaying, but nobody in NZ seems interested, at all, in the selection practices that, for example, make Dr Leeks (and people like him) the only game in town.  Justice was not done for me in the various cases I brought before the High Court.  The Judges made errors of law (e.g., ignoring the TEC stating that 120 points of study = 1 EFTS of work = 1 academic year of work = 34 weeks enrolment including study breaks and the examination period).  The judges made errors of fact (e.g., I was eligible for enrolment so the university was required to process my application for enrolment according to their published criterion for selection whereby my GPA for the purposes of selection for MBChB was 8.6).  Justice Toogood was even pulled out of retirement (which is not proper process for appointing a judge) so as to refuse to uphold justice.  He is unwilling or unable to comprehend that the TEC states the enrolment period associated with the EFTS that the student has applied to be enrolled in and that that regulates what the University is allowed to charge to the studnets IRD for student loans for fees for having the student enrolled for however many years.  New Zealand is not keeping Universities.  New Zealand is not even trying to have a health system.  Apparently our health system is 'competitive'.  What is the aim of the competition?  To unlawfully detain in conditions of torture more people than any other nation in the world?  Or to pat ourselves on the back that we are doing better than Tonga?  They are not even trying to be fair.</p>

                        <p>Justice was not done in the High Court.  The Court of Appeal stated they required tens of thousands of dollars for the cases to go through the court of appeal.  They stated that the cases were all entirely particular and personal against me and not matters of public interest at all.  It isn't a matter of public interest that NZ Universities are keeping false records of student enrolment and false records of IRD debt.  It isn't a matter of public interest that NZ Universities are not getting research students work out for external examination.  That NZ Universities are not allowing external examiners to sign off on timely completion of graduate student research work.  It isn't a matter of public interest that Chris Whelan has not processed a single complaint of wrongdoing that he has received since he took up his position as head of the NZVCC in 2014.  It isn't a matter of public interest that Otago and Auckland Universities are throwing away applications to Medicine from domestic adults in order to ensure that Dr Leeks and people like him are the only game in town.  The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal's decision that these were not matters of public interest and that tens of thousands of dollars were required to be paid to the courts since Justice was not upheld in the High Court because of Judges that were not appointed by proper process precisely for the occasion.  The Social Security Appeals of Authority heard a case in late October and they still have not delivered Judgement on the case that was heard.  The Minister of Justice and Minister of the Courts say that it would be against independence of the Judiciary for the Ministers to remind them on expectations for timely Judgment delivery.</p>

                        <p>New Zealand is not keeping Universities.  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camps.  They record levels of debt against graduate research studnets name for enrolment periods the student never applied to.  They refuse to get the work out to externals.  New Zealand does not have a functioning health system.  They won't process applications to enrol.  They won't acknowledge progression through training.  They won't graduate people who have met requirements for Degree Completions.  They blackbird for slaves, only.  Chris Whelan and the like blackbird for slaves, only.  For a competitive health system where the aim seems to be to get unpaid volunteers to re-enrol and re-enrol and re-enrol in further training to unlawfully imprison and wrongful death as many people as they can get away with.  It's sooooooo competitive.  There's nothing here.</p>

                        <p>Apparently Ashley Bloomfield was appointed Professor for University of Auckland.  He never applied to PhD, never did the work for one, doesn't have any research output.  Apparently the reason they aren't signing off on (or allowing externals to sign off on) new graduates is because there won't be jobs for anybody else.  They'll pull Justice Toogood out of retirement (after he's been payrolled for more than 40  years) rather than appointing a new Judge.  Must keep the social hierarchy.  Apparently there will be jobs for new people only over the dead bodies of these people who were given governmernt jobs for life.  Many of them with tenured positions in the Universities and they have little to no research output to show for all of the government payroll that they have had in their life.  What do they do?  5,000 words of research every year they are paid to research at the University?  How many of them who actually claim research output of their own simply bully their students into fleeing so they can pass their work off as their own?  Give it to external examiners (who do not return it to the student - signifying that they accept the research) and then the University won't acknowledge the student has completed the qualification.  So that down the track other people can pass the students work off as their own.  Corruption.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                        <p>In some instances they aren't even grading the students work properly.  For example, they intentionally market the Public Health Degree Programme as one that is intended for students with a strong background in subjects like Arts and Law.  Then they say that actually it's intended as a 'first in family' Degree whereby it is intended that the graduates will consider themselves lucky to have been allowed to go to University and complete a Degree, at all.  The students aren't expected to be (are failed for) working to internationally accepted standards of scholarship.  Their work won't be assessed on academic merits, at all.  The tutors can write the essays for them else they can copy paste together the lecturers powerpoint slides else they'll be failed for the courses.  Fail anybody who can't / won't output work indistinguishable from the outputs of a computer programme.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                        <p>How many Medical Students did Dr Leeks bully into fleeing?  How many applications to Medicine does Professor Glue throw away so that he can keep up his Glue Factory as the Only Game in Town?  Nobody else need apply.  Nobody else will be graduated.  All of the money for him into perpeptuity.  All of the payroll for him and people like him.  It's sooooo competitive, apparently.  All of the payroll for him until the day that he dies.  </p>

                        <p>New Zealand does not have psychiatry.  Punative institution of abuse.  Not even trying to be theraputic.  Punative.  Abuse.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                        <p>Look at the calibre of the lawyers the NZ Universities chose to hire to defend their entitlement to throw away applications, to throw away research work, to refuse to allow externals to sign off on qualification completions.  They choose to hire senior partners of major firms.  That's the kind of thing that guilty people do.  That's taxpayers dollars they chose to spend defending their entitlement to not follow the statutory laws of NZ.  The courts gave Auckland University extension on their filings when I do not miss a single filing deadline.  They did not file their initial defense on time.  I requested that the courts allow things to proceed in their absense, therefore, but the courts asserted that 'that is not how we do things'.  Right.  So the University of Auckland spent how much money on hiring a partner of Bell Gully, then?  How much in court costs arose because of the courts decision to grant the Univesrity of Auckland etension of time so that they could pay laywers?  The courts do not function.  I wonder if it is because the Univesrity isnt' enrolling, progressing, graduating people from Law School.  What education and training system?  There's nothing here.  What health system?  What judiciary?  What skilled work?  Ashley needs hundreds and hundreds of thousands of tax payers dollars to pass himself off as a Professor, now?  Quickly quickly quickly tell all the graduates of Harvard to come here to do their knock-out gene studies  because nobody will be (and nobody ever was) prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus.  Apparently people can't be prosecuted for anything at all since Meredith Connell has the monopoly on prosecution and they are conflicted out from all the people who put a dollar in their private pockets.  There's nothing here.  </p>

                        <p>It is in the Australian Constitution that NZ is a State of the Federation of Australia.  Australia refuses to acknowledge this, though.  Refuses to supply voting papers to NZers to vote in Federal elections.  Refuses to pay Australian wages.  Refuses to supply Australaian birth certificates and passports.  The only leaders that internatinoal community will acknowledge as the leaders of NZ are ones who run this nation as a prison slave detention camp.  Blackbirding for slaves.  There's nothing here.</p>

                        <p>The Ombudsman delays things only.  Takes more than 1 year.  Anything the Ombudsman decides is not binding anyway.  Apparently it is all very very particular and very very personal how much money the University of Auckland chose to spend asserting their legal entitlement to throw away applications from domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years so as to preferentially select teenagers - many of whom have not finished all of what secondary levels of education are supposed to be offering them for free, in NZ.  Defending their entitlement to select students to Law and Medicine and so on on the basis of whatver they want.  With no accountabiltiy at all.  But still the University has not supplied the information to me as to how  much money the Senior Partner of Bell Gully made off of the University's decision to assert their entitlelment in court.  Whether it was pro bono work that she did in exchange for them still acknowledging her as a graduate of their University, or what.  It doesn't matter what the Ombudsman says, therefore.  Even when mostly what the Obmudsman says is that he is incapable or unwilling of seeing any wrong, at all.  It was very very personal and particular against Ms Roe, apparently.  It isn't sysematic or systemic that his is how people are treated in NZ.  Each and every complaint that Chris Whelan has received since he took up his office in 2014 has been thrown away (systemically and systematically) on the grounds that he has deemed the complaints to be all cases that are very very partiuclar and very very personal against the particular studnet.  All 'relationship problems' between the student and the only game in town that the University will employ to take all the money for doing little to no actual research work of their own.  That's why they pay them, seems to be the case.  To be a bully.  Take all the money out.  Only game in town.  There will be a job for their student only over their dead body, they claim.  They aren't even going to retire (e.g, Justice Toogood).  Only over their dead bodies can there be payrolls for anybody else.  Only game in town.</p>

                        <p>
                            https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/488062/teaching-hospitals-need-to-do-more-to-educate-about-consent-study  'It also found there was also a need to better advertise to patients that they were entering a teaching hospital and medical students would be part of their medical team.'  But they would only be part of their medical team -- if the patient consented for medical students to be part of the medical team. Isn't that what informed consent means?  That once you have been informed of something (e.g., that there are medical students wanting to practice playing doctors and nurses with you) that you have the right to say 'no, I don't want medical students to be part of my medical team'.  But why would our 'health system' listen to what the patients want?  Only Dr Leeks 2.0 need apply.  Only the best candidates for the next him will have their applications to medical school processed, at all.  The students need to get better at explaining to the patients how they have been volunteered for the only option that they have, whether they like it or not.  What health system?  Government institution of abuse.  There's nothing there. 
                        </p>

                        <p>I applied to the ANU to do a PhD on informed consent and how Australasia doesn't seem to comprehend what it is.  To see how they would handle my application.  THey say that my application was 'incomplete' which is false.  Deny that I provided writing samples (you can see the writing samples for yourself on my writing page.  THey also had 3 writing samples on file for me already and a more than 100,000 word PhD that they never got out for external examination.  That's over on the writing page too in case you don't believe me.)  Interesting to see that they chose to falsely accuse me of an 'incomplete application' while subsequently funding was given to various other people to research informed consent.  I guess that's the point of collecting up research proposals.  So you can take the proposal and then give it to someone else.  Take my outputs and give them to someone else.  Pay other people hundreds of thousands of dollars for taking from me all of the work that I do.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                        <p>I guess the consoliation is that they will get sick one day and the special handpicked psychopaths can have their turn with them, then.  It's sooooooo competitive...  The supposed medical students who get in there and have a go at playing doctors and nurses without informing their patients of who they are, what they want to do, why they want to do it, what they will do with the results, what options the patient has..  THey will get sick.  Then their fellow medical student frenemies can practice on them.  Gnawing each others arms off it's soooooo competitive.  Only game in town.  What health system?  What education system?  There's nothing there.</p>
