                                <p>When I get some time I will try and make light and dark themes.  I prefer dark with low-contrast, but I understand it is not to everyone's tastes.</p>

                                <p> I started the Judicial Review tab to help me keep track of where things were up to for the various court cases.  It was helpful to me to have organised things in this way.  Things grew unexpectedly when it came to documenting how / why the University's forced so many versions of my thesis.  I likely will transition bundle-type documents off the publically viewable webpages, eventually.  Until then the evidence is here so people can assess for themselves if the University's are right that I am repetitive and meritless or whether something entirely different is going on.</p>
           
                                <p>You can contact me via the email address: email@kellyroe.org.
                                Yes, you probably read that correctly, 
                                my email address starts with the word "email".
                                I'll let you copy-paste that into whatever email programme you like.

                                        Gavin Belson and Richard, on a Park Bench (Silicon Valley, Season 6, Episode 3:<br><br>

                                        It would benefit us both – equally, holy shit.  Um, look, Gavin, I know we haven’t always seen eye to eye, and we’re not the best of friends, but, this might be a chance to actually help each other out.  Right?  What do you say?<br><br>
        
                                        I mean, Isn’t it obvious?  I say NO!<br><br>
        
                                        What?<br><br>
        
                                        NO!  Fuck no, Richard.  I can’t make a move that would benefit you.  You’re my competition.  Help no rival.  It’s one of the basic principles of business.<br><br>
        
                                        We just spent the last hour bonding about how this business is comprised of backstabbers and cut-throats.<br><br>
        
                                        Yes. Exactly.  And that’s what this is.  It’s a little weird you don’t get it.<br><br>
        
                                        I could help you, Gavin.<br><br>
        
                                        You already have, Richard!  I mean I was sitting up here, feeling totally just impotent, and then you came along and exposed your underbelly, and practically begged me to plunge the knife in!  I mean, I still have a deep hole to crawl out of, but this is a great start!  Y’know, look at that, it barely hurts anymore! Well, if you’ll excuse me, I have a triathalon to train for, and I’m suddenly feeling a wellspring of energy!
