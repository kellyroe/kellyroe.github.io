                            <p>
                            The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications.  They define a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a> 
                            </p>

                           <p>Australasian Universities believe they are entitled to simply refuse to process or progress students work, however.  Take it to court, they say.  Then the courts refuse to progress filings.   
                            </p>

                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.

                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  
                                </p> 

                            <p>
                            It seems to me that the Australian Constition explicitly states that New Zealand is regarded, by them, to be a State of the Federation of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  Australia refuses to honor it's own Constitution. 
                            </p>

                            I think they want me to document 'my descent into terrorism'.  I think that's the idea.  The terrorism breeding programme.  Who does terrorism make look good?  Cry cry cry for more power for the central government?  More guns for the police?  Better guns for the police?  More powers to involuntarily detain people and torture them and abuse them and bully them and not pay them.  Not pay them.  Not pay them. Not pay them.  Not pay them.  More power to the terrorist breeding programme!
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Well, there we go.  Reasons for descent into terrorism have been documented.  Well done for forcing me to do that work by withholding pay.  Great job!  Yay you!  Well done!
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            New Zealand won't train doctors.  Of any variety.  The aim is to prohibit and prevent that kind of work being done.  We like the idea that all Degrees and Honors and Titles are bestowed from above for..  Popularity.  It's a strange kind of populism.  One when the vultures swarm when they sense weakness.  One where you need to be concerned about who is going to stab you in the back.  Your closest frienemies.  So nice to your face from some kind of social pressure...  The triumph they will express around your demise... It's a way to live, I guess...
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            You have to be a bit careful because the MIT grads manufacture the guns and the Harvard grads manufacture the reasons to use the guns.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Why would anybody think that Medicine is about helping people?  Or that education is about teaching people?  In spite of.  Despite.  Certainly not because.  Look at the way the money and titles and honors flow around...
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            How much work was I supposed to do before being credited with a PhD?  Oooooh. I was supposed to spend my time house-sitting for you.  Hanging out with you at the pub and the beach.  Sucking up sucking up sucking up (taking it out by kicking down).  Then I get to torture innocent children for fun -- like Dr Leeks?
