 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">

                            <p>
                                https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/opinion-why-a-bachelor-of-arts-degree-is-a-priority-not-a-punchline/KEFOZ37YRFGWHAE3J44IMKIMJ4/  I'm sorry -- but you don't understand the situation.  Firstly, all students are mocked for whatever reason.  If people saw that you were bothered by them mocking your degree, then mock your degree they would.  It wouldn't matter what degree you were enrolled in, it is just the kiwi way that we have.  Our 'friendliness', if you will, to mock people for whatever seems to get to them.  It is entirely personal, I mean to say.  Don't think that it actually has anything to do with your degree, at all.
                            </p>

                            <p>The real issue is that not very many people actually want to study the Arts.  The University offers arts subjects as being cheaper than science subjects.  I mean to say the University will get more money in fees from you and from the government for babysitting you or keeping your bum on the seats for however many years for keeping you enrolled in science subjects rather than arts subjects.  Now, you might say that science subjects cost more.  That might be true, to a certain extent, but science subjects recuperate that money by having about 1 lecturer per 1,500 first year students and explicitly hiring second year students as laboratory demonstrators and examination invigilators etc.  I suspect that the situation is that the University makes more money off of first year health science, and first year science than it does off of the Arts at undergraduate level.</p>

                            <p>At graduate level everything changes.  The Universities get more and more and more and more money for having studnets re re re re re re re re re re re enrolled, you see.  So they get students (particularly Arts students) to enrol in 3 years of undergrad and then a 1 year honors.  And then a lot of misadvise and misdirection and bullying and abuse goes on to get students doing 2 years of masters followed by up to about a decade or even more of doctoral or what was only supposed to be 3 year PhD.  How does this happen?  Well, what you do is you be sure to hire employees to supervise research who are themselves, for the most part, unproductive.  I mean to say, not producing much if any new research every year.  Few to no new seminars every year.  No books.  Little to no research output since they were credited as having done enough for completion of a doctoral programme.  To the point, often, where you wonder if they actually wrote their doctoral thesis themself or if their supervisor wrote it for them or the university simply reattributed the research outputs of someone else for them to pass of as their own.  Then employed them for the purpose of preventing and prohibiting and obstructing their students from completing their work in a timely fashion.  So the 'university' gets more and more and more and more money from the student and the government for keeping slaves or prisoners or endentured servants.</p>

                            <p>Nobody keeps students re re re re re re re enrolled like the Arts.  In other words, they claim to have 2x or 3x or 4x or more the graduate studnets numbers than what they actually have.  For example, when I applied to do a 120 point 1 EFT 34 weeks (including the external examination period) MPhil with the University of Waikato (with the intention of doing something else from end February of the following year) the Univesrity of Waikato administration was determined that that would not be possible.  See, what they do is they get you working for 12 months before 3 months external examination.  Then they re-enrol you for 6 months additional labor to be followed by another 3 months external examination.  THen they get you to do up to 10 weeks (2 1/2 months) of changes.  The University administration wants to record that students take at least 26 1/2 months to do 34 weeks of work (9 1/2 months is an academic year).  More than double billing.  2x the enrolment numbers.  Every.  Single.  Student.  Is there anybody who has enrolled in a 120 point 1 EFT Masters qualification (e.g., a 1 year of research after completing Honors Year) who has been allowed to have completed the qualification within 34 weeks?  Anybody?  A single person?  Is there a single person who NZ has recorded as having applied to be enrolled in a 120 point masters research 1 year project who has been acknowledged as having completed the qualification withint that time?  I don't think that you will find anybody.  Double billing.  Every.  Time. </p>

                            <p>Consider then the way they record doctoral student enrolments.  The NZ PhD has a minimum enrolment time of 2 years and is supposed to be completed within 3.  Can you name for me a single doctoral canadidate in the arts who had their work go out to external examiners after they had  been enrolled in the doctoral degree for 1 1/2 - 2 1/2 years?  I mean to say, if it takes up to 3 months for a thesis to be externally examined and the Univesrity Calendar Regulations allow the examiners to require changes to the substance to be completed within 10 1/2 weeks (the most likely outcome, one would suppose, since there is always just one more reference that can be ordered by someone to be added or one sentance to be restructured or whatever)...  I'm asking whether the university will actually get the students work out to external examiners to allow the POSSIBILITY of externals signing off on completion of a doctoral thesis within the 2 - 3 year time period that it is supposed to take?  Name me a single arts student who had their work externally examined and was acknowledged by the university to have done enough for a 2-3 year research PhD within 2-3  years.  I don't think there is a single person.</p>

                            <p>What happens is the University bullies and abuses the student and tells them they will fail them outright if they insist on submitting a thesis for external examination.  Even if they submit it the Univesrity won't get it out to externals.  Even if the externals keep the thesis (signifying they accept it) the Univesrity will not acknowlege that the student has done enough.  The studnet must be re re re r er ere re enrolled.  So the University gets more and more and more and more money for having the student enrolled.  The Univesrity will hire supposed 'researchers' whose job is to bully the students into working slower and not producing any research output at all.  The supervisors will all be 'I haven't written a book since I was acknowledged as having done enough for my PhD.  I was forced to wait 10 years of re re re r er e enrolment before my supervisor gave me a doctoral thesis to pass off as my own and you are not allowed to work any faster than me!'.  NZ Universities intentionally hire people who have little to no research output of their own so they can cry cry cry cry cry continually to their graduate research students that they should slooooooow dooooooown and re re re re re re re enrol because you will only be acknowledged as having done enoguh for a PHD over the dead f*cking bodies of the people presently on payroll.  That is what they always told me.  'You'll have to wait for me to die  before there will be a job for you in Philsophy!'  Why would anybody voluntarily want to work with such awful people?  Not even trying to be a productive university.</p>

                            <p>I guess it is to try and drive up the prices at Harvard, and the like.  Probably Ashley Bloomfield will take his half a million dollars +++ per year that he got keeping NZ in unlawful lock-down (for which he seems to have been knighted) and pay Harvard maybe $80,000 per year USD, is it?  To have a son enrolled in Harvard?  So he can room-share with the son of the Health General of..  I don't know...  Mexico.  Or something.  I don't know...  You can be pretty sure, however, that Ashley's sons aren't being enrolled by Ashley to go party party party in Dunedin taking bets on who is most likely to die before the end of Orientation week taking trophies for how many first year health science competitors they can bully or abuse into dropping out...    </p>

                            <p>STEM is not 'at risk' -- because there isn't anything there...  See..  What they tell the first year science studnets is that it's sooooooo competitive... I mean, there are, like 1,500 students enrolled in the class.  And it's soooooo competitive.  Mostly the aim is to get as much money out of the studnets as they can before throwing them away.  The aim is to eliminaate all of them.  There was no alteranative to Dr Green, Dr Leeks.  Professor Glue.  Nobody else wanted to do it, apparently.  Nobody else applied.  Nobody else applied to be enrolled.  Nobody else handed their work in in time.  Nobody else was acknowledged as having graduated.  Nobody could get into the second year compulsory class because it was full of people who were in the class who weren't even on the roll...  So that later they could imprison them as hoaxes and frauds.  I guess because they will pass themselves off as workign a job where the district health boards (or whatever it is now) get more and more and more and more money for claimign to have more and more and more patients in hospital beds.  But Justice Toogood doesn't see anything wrong with a government institution getting money for someone who is dead (getting course and accommodation fees for keeping Mason Pendrous enrolled)...  Just think what the hospitals will be up to!</p>

                            <p>STEM students don't get mocked, perhaps.  Actually, they do get mocked.  They get mocked for wanting to be a medical doctor and so on.  And they get abused for that.  While the Universities and hospitals etc troll for the next person most likely to be put into place to commit most atrocities.  Nobody was held to account for WWII atrocities in Australasia and the atrocities never stopped.  The leaders don't see anything wrong with atrocities.  They wouldn't get to lead if they didn't lead like that in that manner, or way.  Right?  They wouldn't be acknowledged as leaders by overseas?  They wouldn't have been deployed into position by Harvard?  I guess it's soooooo competitive sooooooo many people want to pay and pay and pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to get to go to Harvard so they can detained by the University until the hostage fee is paid.  I suppose.  I don't know.  I do know that US Universities tell studnets when they can expect to graduate whereas NZ pretends to be too f*cking stupid to calculate the amount of work involved in qualifications of various EFTS.  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camps.  A 3 year degree is the level of a community college qualifiation.  It is not acnkowledged as a degree in the US.  But there isn't anything to stop people renting a gown and taking a photo of them dressed up for garduation .T hat's the university experience anyway, right?  People just want the graduation photo and the wedding photo and so on.  Can say they have experienced university.  It's 3 years they didn't pay you to work a job.  3 years of debt they record against you name.  You can see why the government (the major employer) wants EVERYONE to be indefinately detained by the universities to transition them into their prisons or hospitals then aged care institutions.  The death camps of Australasia.  Lorded over by people who don't really have a research output.  Where is the research output?  Let's see all the research output of the Arts employees from NZ Universities!  But why stop there..  Where are the science ouputs of the people on payroll as University academics?  The people attributing the grades to studnets on the basis of keeping enrolled forever the studnets who do the f*cking work.  The keeping of slaves.</p>

                            <p>I don't know.  Let's see.  Where did John Key's son go?  NOt to any University of NZ.  He went to University in France, apparently.  And they acknowledged that he'd done enough for some Degree or other over there, did they?  He graduated with his cohort?  What doctoral student cohorts are there, in NZ, then?  Students who start broadly or roughly the same time...  Whose work is all sent out broadly or roughly the same time...  Or you decide to hold or keep certain of the students back.  Get more and more and more money for having them enrolled so you can reattribute their work to someone else...  Keeping of slaves.  Did someone from France get signed off as having completed a qualifiation in NZ in exhange for John Key's son being returned to NZ relatively unmaimed?  I'm trying to understand how it is supposed to go..  I suppose Justice Toogood had sons...  They can't they appoint them into position as Judge, then, so they can continue on his good works?  He probably would have been explaining to them, from a very young age,  how it was in the bag with Justice Toogood, of course it was.  The GLue factory that is Psychiatry in Dunedin.  Very apropo.  It was meant to be, clearly.  WHo gets appointed to what position in order to do what.  Hahahahaha and what are you going to do about it?  You and whose army?</p>


                            <p>It is what happens when you realise that (originating at or from the highest levels) people aren't even *trying* to  be fair.  And that's the supposed 'Justice System' in NZ.  That is the thing.  To realise that we've been overtaken by f*cking psychopaths.  Oh...  I'm sorry.  It must  be that THEY think there's something wrong with MY mental health that THEY aren't even trying to be fair.  How much money does Una Jagose take every year to obstruct justice?  AND THAT IS WHY THEY PAY HER.  I guess so when she tries to flee (with all her ill-gotten gains) they can simply take it all back.  Throw her in a prison or detention camp.  Hey, it isn't anything different from what she would do to anybody else if given opportunity.  There's nothing here.</p>

                            <p>Where is Jacinda's daughter enrolled in school?  I'm wondering if she's attending school, somewhere, or if she's still on tour with her Mother.  I remember when John Key lost the plot and started pulling girls hair in public he apparently voluntaraily chose to go to Hawaii for a time.  Was taken into US custody, or something.  Seems that that is the way of Jacinda, too.  The US seems keen to display to NZers only information that our supposedly elected leaders are on the take (there was no alternative) for close to 6 years and then they are taken way.  The supposedly elected leader of NZ always seems to voluntarily resign and move to US terrain.  Not much of a democracy, hey.  I guess you can't really have a democracy when there isn't an education or health system or any kind of functioning judiciary.</p>

                            <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/490427/exhausted-gisborne-nurses-in-fear-of-making-a-fatal-mistake-employment-court-hears  They need to get the UN inspectors to go through the hospital and find out how many people are being unlawfully held or detained in the hospital who do not consent to being in the hospital, and who are not being lawfully detained in the hospital.  Let the hostages go.  THey need to identify how many people they are recording as being in the hospital, taking up a bed, who literally died, however many weeks or months or years ago.  But they get more and more and more and more and more money for claiming to have them in a hospital bed.  LIke how Canterbury University got more and more and more money for Mason Pendrous to live in their residential hall -- even though he died over a month ago.  There's nothing wrong with that says the Judge hauled out of retirement and reappointed back on payroll (because that's the proper process for appointing judges now, according to Una Jagose who testifies that she orders evidnence to be destroyed and so on in order to ensure that the abuse in state care victims will die before getting justice.  They will get justice only over her dead body, one can only suppose.  Mostly it's about ensuring that the governmetn can keep on keeping on with the present and current day abuses.  We don't see anything wrong.  Apparently.  Nobody on government payroll can see anything wrong.)  </p>

                            <p>I wonder about the vaccination rates (of all vaccines across the board).  Are they lower, now, than they were pre-Covid?  The effect of the Government mandates was that people would stop having vaccinations.  Right?  That was the idea?  Were were thinking about how we could bring back Polio and Smallpox and all of those kinds of sorts of things.  Remove access to all vaccines except for an experimental one and then once the mandates for the experimental one are gone away people are used to the tried and trues no longer being available.  That was what happened during the mandates.  Right?  People couldn't get other kinds or sorts of vaccines anymore.</p>

                            <p>I think they want to call it 'paradoxical effects'.  Only, it's hard to tell if they are so really really bad at being good or if it is rather that they are really really good at being bad.  I guess what clues you in is whether they are self-congradualtory.  Do they think they are doing a great job?  What do their self-report surveys have to say?</p>

                            <p>Doctors are 'planning to leave'.  THey are 'planning to retire'.  Apparently, these 60 year old and 70 year old doctors are all 'planning to leave' or 'planning to retire'.  They cry cry cry cry cry about how nobody wants to do what they do therefore they can't retire.  Nobody wants to apply to study or work under or with them. THey don't have any new generation people to train.  Guess they are the only game in town.  They won't take their retirement after all.  They'll retire only over their dead bodies.  I mean, what part of 'planning to retire' involves you not setting things up to continue on when you have in fact retired?  What part of 'planning to retire' involves you bloody well ensuring that nobody or no group of people is in fact positioned to do what it is that you were doing.  THey weren't intereted in training students at all. THey weren't interested in being part of a group of people doing the same or similar things at all (being able to get a consult or their patents being able to get a second opinion or choose what they wanted to do or who they wanted to see) at all.  THey were only interested in being tyrants.  Only game in town.  Have to f*ckign kill them to get rid of them.  THey couldn't really have done anything more towards positioning themselves to be indespensible so theyd have to be kept around on payroll until they die.  NZ doesn't get a new judge because we can always pay and pay and pay and pay and pay Justice Toogood to not see anything wrong.  WHy would Una Jagose appoint a new Judge when she knows precisely what kind or sort of Judge Justice Toogood is.  When she's made her role clear (destroying evidnece, ordering destruction of evidence, not following proper process at all on appointment of Judges).  Have to f*cking well murder them off before there would be a job for anybody else.  </p>

                            <p>This latest installment of 'we hired an impostor doctor for cheap' is really very implausible. I remember reading in the Waikato Times about two imposter psychiatrists they hired.  I think both of them left the country once it was exposed that he DHB had hired them.  One on them was a former psychiatric patient (overseas) that's where he learned enough about what psychiatrists seem to do in order to pass himself off as one.  Apparently he wrote no prescriptions and signed off on no involuntary detention observations.  I don't think that is plausible at all.  Or is perhaps that why they hire them?  Because they won't speak out about the cupboards being bare?  If the person is a fraud and isn't able to write prescriptiosn then I suppose they won't be speaking out about the hospital having bare or empty supply cabinets.  It isn't plauisble to think that the people hiring for the DHB did not know that these people were not registered to practice.  I mean, doctors have registration numbers.  Pharmacists check tkhe name of the prescribing clinician against the registration number.  Correct?  And they check to see what medical doctors are prescribing what in the sense of the opiates and so on that they are prescribing.  WHether they are prescribing lethal doses of things.. What is going on.  HOw do you have someone work as a medical doctor, on payroll, who doesn't have an authorisation number to write prescriptions?  It just doesn't make any sense at all.  It defies plausibiltiy or credibility.  I guess that's how they can afford to give various administrators or district health board members payrise after payrise after payrise.  We don't need to pay doctors and nurses and so on.  We can pay administrators.  THey can take all the money out.  ANd staff the hospitals with people willing to pass themselves off as even when they pay and pay and pay and pay the universities.  When they aren't registered to practice.  When they can't write prescriptions.  Nobody else need apply for those positions.  THere' snothing there.  Corruption.  Corruption.  Corruption.  NOt even trying to be fair.  The NZ Universities responsible for medical studnets can't  /  won't properly process the applications.  Will not make offers of enrolment on the basis of academic merits (full time GPA).  THey tell studnets they didn't get a place because they don't have academic merits.  But turns out they will only hire people too stupid or too incompetent or too malevolent to calculate a GPA.  The worst of it is that once you point out their wrong their response is 'and what are you going to do about it?  You and whose army?'  I mean to say they make it pretty damned clear that they have no interest whatsoever in doing things properly and you can't make them.  THey are not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>If they can take a fake empoyees house for his being a fake (never would have hired him if he wasn't known to be a fake)..  When will they take Ashley Bloomfield's home, then?  I mean he's fake professor since he never did the work for PhD -- right?  I don't know how many hundreds of thousands they say they are going to pay him to pass him off as professor.. When can they sieze his house as proceeds of crime, then?  Because how can you be Professor, Ashley, when you don't have a doctoral thesis output?  WHen you don't have any publications?  I guess they never would have hired you if you had actually writtn a thesis and you actually had a research output.  Only the frauds and hoaxes and scummy scams get to be appointed into position.  How is your house Chris Whelan?  Have you processed a single complaint of wrong-doing, yet?  You had one statutory function . Are you able to read out what your statutory function is before th jury, then??</p>


                            <p>Well here we go:  https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/490287/born-within-minutes-of-each-other-graduating-on-the-same-day  3 Tongans (also NZ citizens, born of a NZ judge) are acknowledged as having  graduated from Victora Law School (that's victoria wellington nz not victoria australia).  3.  In one year.  That's equity, right there.  No other Tongans needed to have applied.  Were acknowleged as having applied, in fact.  I'm sure.  That's what it meeeeeeans so be sooooooo competitive (with each other, yeah right).  Fot the good of Tonga, of course.</p>

                            <p>https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/crime/police-seize-home-of-imposter-middlemore-hospital-doctor-to-recover-salary/  The problem I have with this is that they told me that I wasn't accepted to Medical School because my grades weren't good enough -- but turns out they refused to apply their algorithm to my transcript.  They just lied about it, I mean to say. Refused to put their mistake right.  Decided to pay tens of thousands of dollars to lawyers to assert their right to offer enrolment places to people on the basis of whatever arbitrary reasons they wanted.  Otago even paid their lawyers tens of thousands of dollars to justify their entitlement to throw away applications from anybody who may have experienced or witnessed abuse (e.g., victims of abuse in state care).  </p>

                            <p>Who employed the fake doctor?  WHo employed a medical doctor without a current registration to practice number?  How did he write prescsriptions? Under what authorisation?  Didn't the pharmacist identify that they were being handed prescriptions by patients that were written by someone who wasn't registered as a medical doctor?  It defies credability.  Who, on government payroll, intentionally choshe to hire this man for relative cheap knowing full well he was a fraud?  It defies credability.</p>

                            <p>The real problem is that they want to say that his man was not accepted into medical school - but he actually attended medical school classes for nearly 1 year.  He attended cadavar laboratory dissections, particularly.  NOw, the problem that I have with this is that it is not plausible that he forge for himself a working student identification card with an idenfication number.  The University employees would have a roll with the names and ID numbers and faces and they would know the total number of studnets who were enrolled in their class. It is not plausible that someone sneak into a first year checmistry laboratory and pass themselves off as a first year chemistry studnets.  Doing titrations with water, ffs.  It is not at all plausible to think that he fakes and phoney-d his way into a human disseection laboroatory over in the medical school.  What's going on here?  What was the University up to with him?  Did he speak out about someone on government payroll being up to no good so they rescinded his offer of place and told everyone he was a fraud?  They put him on payroll without checking his qualifications with the University?  NOt likely.  Not plausible at all.  THey only put him on payroll because they knew that at any time they would be able to throw him in prison and steal all the stuff back.  Seems more likely.</p>

                            <p>That is a great idea, isn't it?  Identify the crimals and violent offenders and enrol only them.  Then you will never never never have to pay them.  You can just take their stuff and send them off to the death camps.  Turn the fire alarms off and set the building on fire.  Must have been the arsonist that you put into the building precisely for the purposes of idenfifing them as the person who did it before a 'slow and methodical police investigation' has even got underway.  If you aren't going to play ball and say that you did it after being fed who knows how much LSD etc etc then I guess you probably up and decide to suicide all voluntary-like in state care.  This is how we do, in NZ, is it?  Not even trying to be fair.  We don't see any corruption.  NO corruptions.  Poke out all of eyes we don't see any corruption here.</p>

                            <p> https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/auckland/auckland-man-jailed-over-13k-covid-relief-fraud/  Wow.  Jailed over $13,000.  But Chris Whelan takes hundreds of thousands of dollars every single year to not process a single complaint of wrongdoing.  Una Jagose takes more than half a million every year to not follow the proper process for appointing judges and to order destruction of evidence and to generally obstruct and prevent and prohibit justice from being done.  Ashley got more than half a million per year to declare an unlawful lockdown but that wasn't enough, even, he needed to knighted, as well, for his role in declaring an unlawful and illegal lockdown for the entire state of NZL.  Preventing and prohibiting NZ citizens from returning so that infants were born overseas -- which makes the infants citizens of foreign nations who are then positioned to sue the NZ government to recover the cost of raising a kid on the public dime in the USA or wherever they are citizens of, now.  There is precedent from the US doctors who botched tying tubes.  Wrongful birth of infants.  Sued the hospital for the costs involved in raising a kid who they thought they had prevented.  But they conceived because of a botched sterilisation procedure and they weren't psychopathic enough (or something) to abort.  So, the costs involved in wrongful life.  How much it costs to raise a person in the US.  Precedent set by US Courts.  For every child forced to be born as a US citizen because the NZ and Australian Governmetn were too f*cking stupid to allow citizens to come back home during Covid restrictions.  F*cking psychopaths. </p>

                            <p> https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/australian-doctor-freed-from-islamic-terrorists-in-africa-after-seven-years/3BYTWWTZKJHQZBVRREB23AT55E/  Wow, an 81 year old Australian 'doctor' decided he'd set up shop as a doctor someplace foreign to Australia (and not sign off on completion of anybody locals training, I'm sure)...  Nothing to lose -- right?  Maybe Justice Toogood could be sent to go volunteer his 'expertise' (or something) as Judge (or something) to some civilisation NZ considers infererior to ones own.  What a great idea.  </p>

                            <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/300882327/two-men-found-guilty-of-raping-and-filming-abuse-after-meeting-woman-at-takapuna-beach  Awwwww.  What a lovely, romantic story.  I'm sure once they've been convicted NZ will get busy busy busy erecting statues and monuments in their honor and Australia will grant them rights of citizenship and lucarative paid positions in Australia to continue on their good works when it comes to the people of Melbourne.  That's how we do -- right?  What you have to do to earn acknowledgement for your good works in Australia.  Not anything any differnet than what Dr Leeks would have done.  Everybody aspires to be like him.  Right?  So motivating and inspiring he was...  Most highly valued person on government payroll.  Promoted to Australia for his good works... </p>

                            <p> https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/auckland-ferry-building-attack-city-leaders-slam-police-response-to-barbaric-group-assault/FKIVANATRJDY5NVH54HGLTGEXU/  How many of these people (doing the kicking and diversion of people trying to intervene) were themselves on government payroll?  Volunteering their time to the government cause in order to be early parolled etc?  Not even trying to be the developed world at all.  Faces on cameras.  Faces on cameras.  These are the things that are business as usual in NZ.  This is the face of the government.  This is the government . What governmetn?  What police?  What universities?  What lawyers?  There's nothing here. </p>

                            <p>Awwww.  IIIIIIII KNoooooooooow.. eeeeeevery body has at least one book in them.  One book that htey can find from someone else to steal and then pass off in their own name.  But how many people are endless sources, endless springs of productivity?  Oooooooh  aawaaaw I knowwwww I'm gaaaaarbage garbage gaaaaarbage.  Of course I am.  With all of the people who are employed to help me produce high quality research outputs in the normal time.  Is it any wonder the quality of my work???  All of the people working so very hard to throw my work away and discredit me and undermine me and stabotage me..  Is it any wonder that there really isn't anything ain NZ at all.  Cannibals.  Chewing and gnawing each others arms off only.  It's sooooooooooo cmopetitive.  Sooooooooo competitive.  Australia doesn't have research output it's sooooo cmopetitive.  Who can command the most slaves?  reappropriate their work for ones own?   Soooooooooo cmpetitive there's actually nothing there.  Garbage dump of a f*cking wasteland.  Cry cry cry cry cry for submarines.  Not in the next 15 years.  Build your f*cking own.  Awwww stupid retarded children of inbred elite can't do it.  Awwwwwwww.</p>

                            <p>It wasn't that long ago that they were reporting that the payment or ticketing systems or whatever that were installed in the front of the buses were randomly blowing up and injuring the drivers.  So, of course, nobody will voluntarily work as a bus driver, then.  Because it isn't really a job at all it's just yet another NZ governmetn institution of abuse.  Putting you in a situation wehre something will blwo up and unjure or main you.  And ACC won't get it. Of course.  So, anyway, now the buses also trains are just randomly not turning up.  So people can't get to work / study.  Because they need to be re re re re re re re enrolled without pay.  Else they didndt' even turn up to work.  So I guess they won't get pay checks anymore..  But they'll turn up for who knows how many days weeks moths years before they give up and go away.  Because we never were going to pay them. Because there's actually nothing here.</p>

                            <p>Hillary Barry isn't a sports reporter -- right?  She is a 'television personality' the way that what's her name..  Born in south africa educated in england moves to NZ on the back of her husband's career only for NZL to not acknowledge his qualifications and proclaim you NZer of the year for the con-munications work you've done in microbiolgoy telling the NZ people that the studnets working in your lab don't wear face masks when working with infectious organisms and neither should they..  WHen that microbiology media personality...  Anyway..  Hillary Barry is not actually a sports media person.  Right?  Or maybe the idea is that the people do to 'playschool' or whatever might like to show the kids something about soccer..  So they get some film footage of the field.. But mostly they get tickets to all the events because they are part of NZ media, somehow..  No media cards for NZ journalists. What is that about?  I guess it is about (1) freedom of speech so that you can write articles without the government imprisoning you because they don't like what you have to say also (2) you not being required (you required not to) disclose your sources.  So when the judge asks you to disclose your source of information (on threat of torture) you don't.  Because you are media.  Like the attorney-client privaledge or not being required to testify against your marriage partner.  NZ doesn't have media.  No such thing.  No doctors.  No lawyers.  No media.  There isnt' anything here.  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camp land.  The only leaders for NZ that foreign leaders will acknoweledge.  APparently foreign leaders are too f*cking stupid to parse the Autralian Constitution.  That's how f*cking stupid they are.  Go figure.</p>

                            <p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballantyne%27s_fire  41.  There we go.  Glory days.  Pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for government researchers to document the crimes.  </p>

                            <p>https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/on-air/heather-du-plessis-allan-drive/audio/melissa-nightingale-herald-reporter-on-the-loafers-lodge-court-appearance/  I think the UN / international agencies need to send someone out to see what is going on.  I would suppose that what is happening is that the accused is being held in conditions the UN inspectors would likely say amount to torture.  Being involuntariliy drugged with mind-altering substances (e.g., LSD being manufactured in Auckland with the purpose of being given to people to help with 'anxiety' and various things that have been obtained in the name of veteranary science).  I would imagine they are trying to force confession in order to scapegoat this man.  Draw attention away from the fact that people on GOVERNMENT PAYROLL TURNED OFF THE FIRE ALARMS SO THE FIRE ALARMS WOULD NOT SOUND.  They go wah wah wah wah wah nobody would have heard them sound anyway.  We will never know.  Murdered in state care.  The government paid various people on payroll at some institution they chose to call 'loafters lodge' to turn off the f*cking fire alarms and set the place on fire.  Now this guy is being scapegoated.  The UN and international inspectors need to come in right now.  Drug test this man.  What drugs are they finding in his system while he is being kept in conditions of torture in state care.  The NZ government could not be any more corrupt.  F*cking psychopaths.  There is nothing here.
                                
                            </p>

                            <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/bay-of-plenty/132094916/tiny-home-troubles-in-whakatne-council-rules-criticised  Oh come on.  Dude.  Don't you understand the Kiwi way? Murder death kill!  Murder death kill!  Murder death kill!  Off to a government instituion of abuse for you!  Murder death kill!  Murder death kill!  Murder death kill!</p>

                            <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/490221/meatworks-fined-280-000-over-health-and-safety-failures  Wow.  $50,000 NZD to the applicant.  That probably won't cover the costs of the schedule costs together with the legal fees.  In other words, the person who was wronged by the government (for working a job where people did not folow basic health and safety laws) must pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for the governments failures and the governments crimes.  Quickly quickly quickly identify all the students given overseas scholarships to study and cut their hands off!!! Hands off our slaves!!!!</p>

                            <p>Okay, I'm sorry. The news report said the person who has been accused of setting the fire has 'tried' to sack his lawyer.  I just wanted to check..  He was actually able to sack the f*cking lawyer -- right?  The only lawyer the government would appoint do defend him.  Right?  The lawyer who, no doubt, told him could either plead guilty else not guilty -- by reason of insanity.  Could etiher to go to a forensic psychiatric institution else a non-forensic prison institution.  You choose. My way or the highway.  There is no alternative.  That kind of sort of a lawyer.  Only ones NZ would acknoweldge actually graduated.  Only ones given the payroll to work for the government etc.</p>

                            <p>So... In NZ they massively over-prescribe medication that is out of patient therefore cheap.  For example, doing everything they can to massively overprescribe vast amounts of out of patient old generation anti-psychotics in spite of (or likely because of) their known side-effects of Parkinsons and Parkinsonian-like symptoms.  Why!!! Give me a medal for my obvous research finding that NZ is massively over-prescribing old generation anti-psychotics in order o have very very very very high rates of Parkinsons and Parkinsonian like symptoms.  Give us more money for researching Parkinsons and Parkinsonian like symptoms.  Free prescriptions!!! I mean...  Let's be clear.. The NZL governmetn was going to send the bill to the victims.  The victims could pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for the old generation anti-psychotic presriptiosnt that were killing them with Parkinsons and Parkinsonian like symptoms.  Never stop paying never stop paying never stop paying for the criems of the government.  Ooooooh.  You're going to waive the prescription costs..  But not the legal costs involved in holding the NZ government accountable for it's crimes.  Can't / wont' process applications to medicine.  can't / wont' sign off on completion of training.  Can't / wont' publically advertise jobs.  Can't / won't empoy people competent to practice.  Dr Leeks is the only game in town.  It isnt' like he was doing anything any differnt from waht anybody else acknoweldged as graduate would be doing.  Overtaken bky taken over by psychopaths.  Only game in town.  There's nothing here.  Says the only ARC funded researchers of Australia.  You're f*cking welcome.  Science con-munications at it's best / worst.  Only game in town.</p>

                            <p>Oh. Also...  So the Government prosecutors have gone after a vulnerable target telling them they need to plead 'guilty by reason of insanity' is they are to have any compassion shown by the court to them at all (that's what they told the person they locked up as the Christchurch terrorist -- right?  Instead of giving him a fair trial they tried to force him to confess else they were going to torture him and so on...)...  What right to a fair trial, in NZ.  NZ won't extradite kim.com so he can have a fair trial in the US.  Rather, NZ wants to be a prison camp for kim.com and he can pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the courts of NZ to not have a fair trial in the US.  The NZ courts are okay with that.  Can't find reason in the federal laws of Australia to deport him.  He can refile and refile and refile and pay and pay and pay the courts of NZL to not have a fair trial in the USA.  The leaders of NZ decide to try and profit off those charged with criminal offences in the USA.  Detention camp.  There's nothing here.</p>

                            <p>When the world's media was reporting alleged abuses against the Uyghur people in China and most of the world was saying that what was going on was unacceptable...  The NZ government...  Instead of saying 'these are allegations that need to be looked into because if they are true then something needs to be done because this is not acceptable'...  The NZ governmetn was the only government in the world that was saying 'we grant that these are true and we don't have any problem with it.  It isn't anything different from what it is that we aim and aspire to do as governmetn of NZL'.  That's the truth of the situation.  I don't know what was going on with the Uyghur people in CHina.  I don't know how much the Chinese Government accepted what was going on or condemned it or..  I don't know.  What I do know is the attitude of the NZL government.  They were not questioning the truth of the allegations, they seemed to accept the truth of the allegations.  But they themselves seemed only to aspire to comparable crimes.  Not condemn them as crimes.  Clearly nobody expects NZL to have the miltary might to stand up to China in that kind or sort of way.  What is surprising is that NZL doesn't think that the only game they are actually entitled to play (that htey could actually be a contender for) is the moral high ground.  No.  Rather, NZL aspires only to identify the worst and aim to new lows.  Not even trying to be fair.  </p>

                            <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/132085866/man-charged-over-fatal-loafers-lodge-fire-tries-to-sack-lawyer  Police are not looking at anybody else.  People are looking at other people. Which is it?  When the Jury asks 'did you look into anybody else' the police say 'yes'.  It wasn't that the police decided who had done it based on who was the easiest scapegoat.  They actually investigated multiple suspects.  No.  They just went after the easiest scapegoat.  Person of no fixed abode.  How recently was the lodge paid money from the government precisely for the purposes of housing person of 'no fixed abode'?  The lodge got paid how much to house someone (likely with history of arson) thinking they could provoke him into setting a fire (or blame or set him up for having lit one) so they can collect the insurance.  Right?  That's how we do?  Who was responsible for turning the fire alarms off so they wouldn't sound?  What does the police investigation say about that?  Whose responsibility was it to ensure they were functional (report them if they werent')?  The lawyer is not competent because he wont' accept any plea other than 'guilty' or 'not guilty by reason of insantity?"  they won't accepted medical expert testomony as to the accused mental state by anybody other than someone who says they need to be fed LSD non-prescrptions in the name of medical treatment for their delusions arising from the fact they chose to plead 'not guilty'.  SOunds like the state of psychiatry also law also education also government in NZL.  I guess they are all upset about the fact that it got less than 10.  Better luck with the next death camp.  Maybe you can get 100 or more.  Right?</p>

                            <p>TECH RANT</p>

                            <p>Okay, so...  I got an Apple Watch.  Because my sister got one and said it was great, and my niece got one and said it was great...  Anyway... I ended up getting an apple watch.  I was lucky that I purchased an SE II phone and then (I'm not kidding) the VERY NEXT DAY they annouced the launch of the SE III.  So...  I emailed them and said 'oh noes, I did not see that coming.  Can I get an SE III instead?' and they said 'our price went up and if you will pay the price increase -- of course!'  So I ended up with an SE III at launch (I meant to say).  An apple phone with all of the software support, many years of longevity that that ensues...  So...  I got an Applie Watch.  Because I'm not much into phones (hence the SE phone decision).  And...</p>

                            <p>In many respects I prefer the watch.  I like how it notifies me subtly and not invasively when my phone is ringing or when an email arrives.  I like how it is not intrusive.  I think that it is perfect for reliable and subtle notification.  The thing with the phone is that if you aren't holding it in your hand then you don't notice it.  Else, if you are going to stuff it in your bag you need to set the notification on very loud.  So it becomes either very intrusive else it doesn't notify you at all.  Because the watch is conveniently located on your wrist it is a reliable indicator.  And you can turn the signal strength well down so you reliably get the message in a way that you can legitimately choose what to do with it.  It doesn't f*cking broadcast to everyone that you got a message that you should attend to (else you don't attend to your messages)..  It's pretty great in that respect, actually.</p>

                            <p>So, then, what are expectations on time-keeping devices?  Well. Tell the f*cking time.  Shouldn't really have to say that, I would have thought.  Does it do it?  Yes, I think it does.  It has an 'always on' display that is doing something subtle that I don't really understand.  I think it is some combination of a dim screen shot of time on last awaken and then when you gesture your arm (move it towards your face) it will awaken (screen brighten) and it updates the time.  You can tell that the time is 'live' then because the second hand is moving.  For times when you want an accurate time.  Which is not actually very often (considering how very very very very many points it is available during the day).  I mean to say there isn't really any point in the watch displaying the time -- when you aren't looking at it to tell you the time.  Of course.  Yeah.  Of course.  It's actually very smart in ways people probably didn't really think that it would need to be...</p>

                            <p>It is a feat of microelectronics.  Microengineering.  It's f*cking tiny.  They packed a battery in there and so on.  It's pretty amazing.  When you see the tear-downs.  The engineering that went into manufacturing them.  Minraturisation.  Yeah.  Amazing.  </p>

                            <p>So then.. Extension of time-keeping.  Calendar.  I expect it to have functioning and functional calendar.  Yes.  I do.  I think that is the obvious next move.  Now... I KNOW THAT I DID..  I KNOW THAT I DID..  Schedule the Diablo 4 server slam into my i calendar.  Google calendar.  To synch with my phone and watch.  And I set my watch to have 'next event' notifiacation.  ANd when it works i'ts f*cking amazing.  PDA device of hte future.  It's wonderful.  It tells you when your next event is scheduled for (the way it tells you the time).  ANd you can set notifiacations so that it tells you when it is time to start getting ready (e.g., if you want 1 hour to get ready at home before leaving) or whatever.  You can set alarms associated with the event.  So that you start getting ready on time.  So you leave the house in time.  Stuff like that.  When it works well.  When it works well...  You can schedule an event (Diablo Server Slam) in Pacific Daylight Time and it will notify you 10 minutes before the event starts when you are located in NZL.  Right?  Right?  Am I right?  No..  Uh..  The event mysteriously disappeared from my calendar entirely . I think we are not quite there yet.  You also can't set your own alarms before the event (e.g, I want 8 minutes notifiation because I reckon it will take me 8 minutes to get there and apple watch confers on my walking speed so let me choose what kind of lead time I want reminders for on the events I've scheduled.  Also..  Let me nest events.  If I want to schedule 5 days of conference and however many talks within the conference schedule don't tell me there is a conflict between my attending conference generally (a thematic event if you will) and particular talks that have been scheduled through conference.  Let me schedule attending a Ballet and maybe playing a few hours of Zelda during a 24 hour server slam.  I can schedule breaks during event.  Conflicts aren't fatal...  Let people schedule things more...  Nest events (e.g., thematic events that go for days)  Yeah...  It isn't quite there yet...</p>

                            <p>I'm still trying to figure how to harvest my own data from the watch.  I know it is a prototype device, really.  Rather than fully functional at launch.  Be honest about that then adn though.  I guess politics...  Nobody wants people to be clear when they are on work time vs when they are on personal time.  When tehy are speaking or posting or being in a personal capacity vs a paid work capacity.  Slaves!!!  No such thing as not -work time.  WE own you.  It would be a conflict for you to schedule any events or meetings or anything at all while you are 'at work'.  Irrevokable irremediable conflict.  Nothing can be scheduled while you are 'at work'.  Not on your home or personal devices.  Of cousre  When do you take your work devices off?  Un-emplant the microchips?  WHy oh why oh why would anybody think that they only microchip peole's prized pets?  Of the animal variety, I mean.  Why oh why oh why wouldn't they be microchipping people?  I mean think abou it for half a sec...</p>

                            <p>I guess it does have something to do with political pressure.  Not wanting people to be clear about work time vs personal time.  Stealing people's personal lives.  Keeping of slaves.</p>

                            <p>THE POINT (I'm getting there, I'm getting there)</p>

                            <p>Slightly (?) facesiously?  Is that the word?  I don't know..  What are the reasonable time-keeping or management functions that could be expected of the Apple watch 8 that I purchased?  What is the cost of the horn or whatever it was saddle mounted trophy that people got for reaching level 20 and killing the boss who spawned only on 3 hourly spawn schedules?  I missed the f*cking spawn times until the very very very very last spawn time because Apple watch didn't f*cking notify me of the start of the f*cking server slam time.  And then I sucked.  Maybe they nerfed my class or my build or maybe I suck (probably the latter) but the point is that I could have likely would have figured it out if I had more time to participate in teh event.  Which I couldn't because I trusted the f*cking watch to tell me when the even was going to start..  And it didn't.  So I thought the slam didn't start until Sunday morning (for me my time) but that was wrong....  ANyway..  Who is going to sue Apple over the loss of the irreplacable Diablo trophy mount?  Not me...  But someone should..  Just saying...  Yeah.  A sort of prototype suing tehm of what happens when..  I don't know.  INsert your favorite 'oops I missed it' moment there at the most massive amount of cost you can think of.  Because???  Apple.  If anybody has shoulders broad enough to figure it out...  Welome.  Thanks.  Pay me later.  Yeah, right.</p>

                            <p>END TECH RANT</p>

                            <p>When I was subcontracted to Macquarie, or Jeannette, really, to do 1 x 2 hour lecture and 1 tutorial for her every week (the course requirement was only for 2 hours of lecture and 1 tutorial per week) for 12 or maybe it was 13 weeks of the semester...  She got an ARC research grant to study psychopathy.  That was what she was paid to do research on.  Previously Martin Davies was given an ARC grant to to research on delusions.  The ARC was giving philosophy people money to do research projects in philosophy of psychopathology, you see.  Dave Chalmer's made a bit of a name for himself going on about zombies.  Philosophical zombies.  Rather than hollywood zombies.  People went on to me, during my time at the ANU, about psychopaths, a lot.  About pschopathy.  There is quite the philosophical and scientific literature on psychopathy.  Modelling how 'tit for tat with reciprocal bias' loses when one or two cheaters and defectors or psychopaths come into the situation and decmiate the local community.  Going on about how co-operation couldn't possibly evolve.  There can't be any.  Can't be any such thing.  No ethics.  No morality.  Everything has been taken over by psychopaths.  The Autralian Government was paying people to to research or write up about how psychopaths, psychopaths, psychopaths, so far as the eye could see.  Noramlise it, I guess.  Like how some people were paid really rather a lot to normalise things that juries tend to find deviant.  Dr Leeks experiments or observational studies or whatever.  To normalise that sort or kind of thing.  NOrmalise PRofessor Glue's Glue Factory.  It isn't like anybody was doing anything different to what Dr Green was trained to do -- right?  Psychopaths.  Psychopaths.  Psychopaths so far as the eye can see... </p>

                            <p>I think she wanted me to do a literature review for her, too.  At one point I was like...  Uh...  There is a lot of material out there I don't really see how to do one..  And, um...  She was paying me by the hour was she?  To do her research...  Subcontracting her research grant too, I suppose.  Taking hundreds and hundreds of thousands for herself (like Martin Davies did to work on delusions) and then take work from me.  Martin was going on about delusions being modelled as perceptual problems.  Like hallucinations.  My contribution was to focus on the affect side of things.  After which he wrote up some stuff with his wife focusing on the motivational side of things.  To link to motor output systems.  Anyway...  The worst of it was about him not writing me a reference for the work that I did for him.  He didn't actually encourage me to apply to the ANU -- but he was leaving for Oxford, at any rate, so if I had have applied there to have studied with him he would have moved away, anyway.   No point trying to work with particular people they just ship them around intentionally to tell the research studnets they need to start over again, start over again, just do another thesis now.  Just one more thesis.  Hey why don't you do all of your supervisors research so that they can get hundreds of thousands of dollars to party party party and just hand them all your work so they can submit it as their own with a new skin on it.  Corruption.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>But that is why I go on about psychopaths.  Because they went on and on and on about psychopaths to me.  Telling me that they were psychopaths.  They had taken over the university and there wasn't anything of any value left there.  All of the money for them to keep slaves.  </p>

                            <p>__</p>

                            <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/300883074/man-due-in-court-this-morning-charged-with-arson-after-deadly-loafers-lodge-fire  They have charged someone with 'arson', already.  Not looking at prosecuting anybody else, already.  Not prosecuting for manslaughter.  Not prosecuting for murder.  I think if you are committing a crime (e.g., arson) and someone dies then that is enough to convert manslaughter into murder regardless of intent.  I thought that was the way that that went.  But the Judge would have to instruct the Jury on that.  I guess what is likely (given that this is NZ and all) is that one person has been picked out to be scapegoated.  How much money does Loafers Lodge management get out of the insurance company for subcontracting out the destruction component or part of their rebuild?  I think that was why people wanted to miswire heaters.  The idea was to collect the insurance money.  Like how people want to have emergency accommodation slums so that they can provoke and blame the tenants for meth contamination and holes in the walls etc etc.  Get the government to pay out for new carpet and paint and so on.  Quite the market to mis-manage the hostages.  People kept in state care.  That's what is going on when the government redirects money away from the person to people on government payroll to keep them.  Right?  When the rent money goes from the government to the accommodation provider rather than to the person to be detained in the accommodation.  Interesting that a former prisoner says that he's being kept by the government in, effectively, a prison institution.  Institutional care.  Setting of the fire alarms until they turn them off because of the number of false alarms.  So that then it's easy to blame one of the arsonists they intentionally chose to install in the building to do the 'work' for which they don't even pay him.  How to breed a terrorist?  Right, Jacinda?  Isn't that the aim purpose point or goal of the NZ government?  To pay and pay and pay and pay and pay managers of outfits like these to keep people hostages in State care institutions.  We don't have a skilled workforce.  We don't have any people.  Right?  NO people.  I don't see any people.  Do you see any people?  What people?  What skilled workers?  What work?  What judiciary?  What university?  What research output?  
                                

                            </p>

                            <p>I applied to ANU last year to see how they would handle  my appication.  They declined it on grounds that my application was 'incomplete'.  Said I didn't supply a writing sample.  But they had 3 writing samples from me on file, already, that they used to offer me a summer research scholarship and then enrolment in their PhD programme. In fact, they also have evidence of a more than 100,000 word thesis that I supplied to my supervisor and the univesrity administration...  That they never sent me any comments on and they never got out to externals for external examination.  My application to enrol was not incomplete.  They just open their face holes and garbage falls out.  It's hard to see people when they don't behave..  What's that, Sterelny?  No evidence of behavioral modernity at all.  3 Writing samples from me on file already.  That were already acknowledged as having been received by the ANU.  Sterelny refuses to write me a reference.  For all the work I've done that he refuses to acknowledge.  Martin Davies refuses to write me a reference.  For all the work that I did on the project he was paid hundreds and hundreds and thousands of dollars of Australian research funding to work on.  He hires a post-doc from MIT and me as a summer research scholar.  I hand them over my work.  THey won't even supply me with a reference.  MIT declines my application to there so quickly it was like a script prevented it from even going to the department.  I'm remembering applying for a post-doctoral fellowship at Macquarie and telling them that I've got my thesis draft to my supervisor waiting for him to commetn on it / get it out to externals for external examination.  I was never even informed by MacQUarie that my application for post-doc was not successful.  I guess someone just threw it away in order to give the job to someone else.  Rachel, was it?  Probably.  Probably was Rachel at that point.  I remember being happy for her that he got some job...  Because I am not a psychopath.  Where is the credit for my PhD?  I remember sending two of my writing samples to a journal.  PPP.  I submitted them to the journal for publication . YOu aren't supposed to submimt them to be published anywhere else while you are waiting to hear if a journal is going to be publishing your work.  SO everything is held up.  For how many years do you wait?  YOu know..  I never did hear anything back from the Journal.  PPP never told me that they didndt' consider my articles good enough for publication.  More than a decade later I publish them on my own f*cking website.  F*cking psychopaths.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  What research output?  There's nothing there.  Nobody home.  Send out invitations to people and tell them what you want them to say.  F*cking garbage.  I don't see any f*cking people at all.  What people?  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                            

                           <p>Australasian Universities aren't functioning as Universities.  They aren't properly processing applications to enrol.  They aren't properly acknowledging progression through training.  They aren't employing people to supervise studnets, get their work out to external examiners, allow externals to sign the students off when their work is at the requisite standard.  They aren't graduating the studnets.  Keeping them re re re re re enrolled for more and more and more and more money for the University.  I've put some of my academic work up on this site.  I didn't start out overly or overtly political but they wouldn't process or progree my work.  I was supposed to just keep handing over more and more and more work, oh, and taking out more and more and more debt to the University so that they could have pay increases for themselves while they don't do the job for which they are paid.  I think the journals etc are just scams, basically.  Indefinately hold up publication until the people are bullied into leaving so they can reattribute authorship to people on payroll.  I don't know that the people they chose to say graduates had their theses externally examined or if they paid bribes or whatever to the University in exhange for them saying they'd done enough for their qualification completion.</p>

                           <p>Australasia doesn't really seem to have functioning or functional health system, education system, judiciary.  They didn't enrol, acknowledge progression through training, graduate, employ people willing and or able to do those kinds of jobs.  There doesn't really seem to be anything there.</p>

                           <p>The Australian Constitution says that NZ is a State of Australia.  It is named a State of Australia.  The second original state after NSW.  But Australia won't give Australian passports or birth certificates to people who were born in NZ.  Won't process applications for enrolment in certain qualifications. Won't supply federal voting papers.  Won't process applications for certain government jobs.  Who arranges for New Zealand Currency to be printed in...  Canada?  To disguise just how low NZ wages are kept.  To prevent travel and the like.  New Manus Island.  Prison camp.  Detention camp.  Keeping slaves.  Treating the students as their property.  More and more and more and more money for more and more and more enrolment.  Not doing the job for which they are paid.  I guess the reason why they pay CHris Whelan hundreds of thousands of dollars per year is because he has the statutory function of processing complaints of wrongdoing.  He has used his position to refuse to process any complaints of wrongdoing.  Una Jagose has used her position to obstruct justice and order evidence to be hidden and thrown away (her role in the abuse in NZ government care inquiry).  Reappointing retired judges back on payroll so they can see nothing wrong (Justice Toogood was recently appointed not by proper process).  Not even trying to do any of the things they are on payroll to do.  Seemingly on payroll precisely only because they are unwilling and or unable to do any of the things they are supposedly paid to do.  Upside down stupid-f*cking land.</p>

                           <p>
                               ______________
                           </p>

                           <p>I did my undergrad in Philosophy and Psychology and my Full-Time GPA (according to Univesrity of Auckland published algorithm) over my 4 year undergrad + honors years is 8.6 (out of a possible 9.0),  That is to say, somewhere between an A and an A+.  I wanted to apply to study for PhD in the USA because I wanted to do 2 more years of course-work and have a broader breadth and depth to my knowledge before writing a 3 year thesis.  I was told that I should enrol in a Masters Degree, then, and write a research thesis while I was applying to the US.  So I enrolled in a 120 point only Masters Research Qualification (Research Masters are only 120 points or 1 year or 1EFT qualifications for students who have already completed their Honors Year).  I got a summer research scholarship to the ANU and worked with Professor Martin Davies over the summer on his Australian Research Council funded project on 'delusion'.  That was how I started working on that topic.  He told me not to apply to Australia for PhD and the US for PhD at the same time because if I accepted offer of place to Australia and then the US said they wanted me then I would need to reneg on the Australian place which would mean they would be out of funding for a student since it would be too late for them to then give the place they offered to me to someone else.  So I held off applying to Australia (on Martin Davies Advice) and he did not supply a reference to me at the end of the SUmmer.  He said 'ask the people back home who will rave about you'.  I didn't get accepted to the 2 US Universities I applied to.  Cornell and MIT.  Cornell didn't let me know that my application had been declined.  I contacted them more than 3 months later and got a letter from one of their former employees who had moved to Harvard (the person I named as potential supervisor) to reassure me that my application had been forwarded to the department and processed.  They didn't just take my $80 US application fee and then not even process my application to Cornell at all!  She reassured me.  It was just that they didn't send me a letter to let me know that I hadn't been offered a place.  That was their only ommission. </p>

                           <p>The University of Waikato people encouraged me to apply for an extension to my Masters thesis work.  I think that was how it went.  Retrospectively.  They said that I could do more teaching for them if I was still enrolled as a student with them.  I could still have my University library access and access to office space.  Still live in University accommodation.  I don't quite remember how that went.  I do remember that nobody from Waikato suggested to me that I apply to do a PhD at Waikato since I'd already been working on a Masters Research for one year.   Nobody said 'just get out the work that you have and maybe the external examiners will suggest that you keep working on it as a doctoral thesis...  Or maybe they will say that you have done enough for a Masters thesis in one year...  Take a gap year..  Apply for jobs in something other than Philsoohpy..  If you want to do Medicine then apply to Auckland now, on the back of your current GPA...'  Nobody said anything like that.  All the people on University payroll for student support services and the like..  My supervisor..  Various people in the Philsophy Department...  They just encouraged me to take our re-enrolment in the 1 year Masters qualification.  Taking 2 years to do 120 points of work means I'm dropping back to part-time status.   How much teaching work was I doing at that time?  I think I was doing a lot, actually...  They will fill up the grad studnets with tutoring and grading and teaching...</p>

                           <p>I'm thinking of everyone I know who has done a Masters thesis.  With Waikato and Auckland. One person...  She said she ended up taking 2 years.  SHe will get very red in the cheeks and say that it was her fault for slacking...  She started out on one thing and then it turned into something else..  There was some special reason why she needed to take 2x the standard time.  Another person I know said that there was a special reason why he had to take 2x the standard time.  His supevisor was sick and so that's why he wasn't getting him the supervision and so on.  Everybody I know..  All of them.  Every single person has a story about why they were held back from being allowed to complete..  From being expected to complete.  Held back from completing their 1 year of research on time.  Every one of the studnets thinks that it is their fault.  Or their decision.  They take responsibility for why the University didn't look at graduating them for 1 year of research that htey did over 1 year.  They all think that they were lucky to have been allowed to graduate at all.  After being requird to take 2x the standard time.</p>

                           <p>After I didn't get a place in the US I applied to 2 Universities in Australia.  ANU and Macquarie.  ANU told me that Martin Davies was leaving for Oxford but I should make my project sort of broadly applicable to differnet people who might be around to supervise over that time.  Martin Davies refused to write me a reference but he said he would put in a good word for me at or with the ANU.  They offered me a scholarship funded place to study there.  Macquarie did as well.  And Paul Griffiths encouraged me to apply to Queensland.  I said I'd missed the application deadline and he said it didn't matter I should get an application in anyway.  Then I got offered a place at Queensland, too.  Even though I wasn't eligible for that since my application was received late.  They wanted me to write to Queensland and say, then, that I wasn't accepting the place in Queensland because of some political thing..  Paul Griffiths (after having encouraged me to apply to Queensland) turned out to be moving to Sydney anyway.  He didnt' tell me that.  He just encouraged me to apply to Queensland so I could study with him and then it turned out that he wasn't going to be in Queensland, anyway, so if I had have accepted a place in Queensland to study with him I would have ended up in Queensland while he moved to Sydney.  I mean to say.. It looks to me like they move the supervisors around.  WHen it's time to sign their student off or do work supervising their students.  They move them so the studnets can internalise why they need to take more and more and more time.  WHy their work isn't being accepted by the Univesrity.</p>

                           <p>My ANU notes say that Kim Sterelny was named as my supervisor.  He didn't arrive until I'd been there for 6 months.  He didn't email me or anything before he arrived.  I have writing that I did (I've posted it on the seminars page) so you can see the sort of 6,000 word articles that I was writing during my first 2 years at the ANU.  Then I went to North Carolina Chapel Hill for 1 year.  You can see the work I wrote for the Centre For Cognitive Neuroscience when I was auditing one of their graduate level classes (for no credit).  Responding to the course contents for the textbook that the faculty on staff wrote there.  Giving them my written work for course content that I'll not be formally credited with.  I didn't give course work to UNC Chapel Hill. I wasn't sure how that was supposed to go.  Auditing courses for no credit.  Am I to give them written work so they can reattribute authorship to someone else for someoen else to have credit for my work, then?  Is that the idea/l?  I was paid by UNC Chapel Hill to teach 1 course per semester, though (the equivalent of their grad students) and I could attend their courses.  So I could listen to 1 year of leactures and participate in tutorial discussions etc in graduate level courses that are not offered, at all, in Australasia.  With the 3 years (or however many decades)of research only doctoral theses.  THey don't have graduate level coursework.  </p>

                           <p>Then I return to Australia and they don't give me any comments on my written work.  I don't want ot go up to University to have morning tea and afternoon tea and eat my lunch.  So I stop going to University.  I email them my work so there is a record they received it.  There weren't in person meetings.  Check my supervisors email outbox for evidence of supervision.  I don't see any evidence that he did the job for which he was on payroll.  But that was his job -- right?  To get more and more and more money for hte 'university' for keeping hostages re re r er e re re re re re re re enrolled. His slaves a slaving . So he can take their work and reattribute authorship to someone else.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                           <p>So, that's a  nasty business.  I wanted to do Medicine.  Work as a Psychiatrist.  There wasn't anything there in Philosophy, you see.  Psychopaths...  Been taken over by people having soooo much fun taking all the money...  Requiring studnets go on camping trips...  Dinners.  Drinks.  Not processing the work.  Not getting the work to externals.</p>

                           <p>Australia won't allow NZ citizens to take Australian Government Loans to train in certain courses (e.g., Medicine).  NZ studnets are considered local only for some things.  I was given a local scholarship for PhD study.  But wasn't eligible for HELP or HEX (they renamed it aptly, apparently, anyway).  THey are keeping slave prison hostage detention camps.  They don't have a health system.  It's sooooo competitive.  Death camps.  I mean...  Dr Leeks.  Once it started to become publically known the kinds and sorts of things he'd been doing they moved him to Melbourne.  To better facilitate his ongoing crimes.  They intentionally enabled him.  He was most valued employee.  That tells you everything you need to know about Psychiatry.  Medicine generally.  I mean, it's not plausible to think they don't have security cameras up in the OR's etc.  The ED's etc.  But still all these unauthorised people in the OR's and the ED's committing various crimes.  Atrocities.  On government payroll to commite crimes and atrocities.  </p>

                           <p>The wrong people won the war in Australasia.  We know because the atrocities never stopped.  Not even trying to be fair.  It's soooooo competitive, apparently.  There's nothing here.  Psychopaths.</p>

                           <p>They want to say more than 80 per cent of NZ studnets enrolled in 'Degree qualifications' are doing 'vocational degrees'.  What that means is that they do internship after internship after internship after internship while the Government records only increasing levels of debt against their name because they supposedly or allegedly owe the universities for course-fees.  The Universities get money from the government more and more and more and more money for having slaves a slaving on their internships.  It has no inention at all of graduating any of them at all. It is not going to pay any of them at all for doing skilled labor post-graduation.  You can get paid minimum wage to be a 'healthcare assistant' in an 'unskilled capacity' else you can pay and pay and pay and pay the university to do the same job as an unpaid intern with the vauge promise that after however many years of you a slaving they'll graduate you and employ you as a registered nurse. But why would they pay you to work as a registered nurse when they can get you paying the university and slaving the job for free?  Look at all the research work that I handed over to the Univerisity.  MOre and more and more and more research while they record only ever increasing levels of debt against my name.  Look at the research output of all the people on payroll?  Plagarists.  They don't write research output.  They are too busy having morning tea and lunch and afternoon tea and dinner and drinks and going off on camping trips.  Flying around the world to have yakkity yak yaks about reattributing the research output of the slaves to people on payroll who don't even to any of the ethings for which they are paid.  What research output?  What Universities?  What health system? What Judiciary?  There's nothing there.</p>

                           <p>Looking at hte Jobs available in NZ anyone would think the most in-demand job there is is the job that the government advertises and readvertises and readvertises.  For someone to work for the government as a 'recruitment consultant' and record how many hostages they are keeping unemployed or redeployed to voluntary work or slave work.  When it's time to pay the workers it's time to have them deported.  Right?  Locked up in the name of psychiatry (they must be mentally ill if they think they are going to get sign off on completion of training).  There's nothing here.  Garbage dump of a f*cking wasteland.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                           <p>I think Queensland has stopped doing genetic testing because most people's paternity turns out to be problematic.  The increasing number of people turning to 'medical professionals' to help them conceive.  Why would anybody think that they would actually be making viable embryos that are actually the progeny of the people who think they are...  I mean to say...  Wouldn't it be more likely that some f*cking psychopath Medical Doctor (the only one they would have on payroll) was using his own sperm for everything?  Wouldn't that be more likely?  Jacinda announces to the Medical Graduates of Harvard that NZ never prosecuted anybody for wrongful death of a foetus.  We have highest rates of abuse and so on.  What they really want to do is breed knock-out babies..  Try knocking out various genes. In the name of medical research and helping people of course.  But what they are looking for is trying to breed 'angel-man' babies.  Pretty little elven things who you can do anything anything anything to and they will just giggle and smile.  I would imagine they would / could get quite a lot of money for infants like that.  Non-verbal would be best.  Not able to testify against the government or anybody else in a court of law.  Maybe not having the congnitive capacity to understand anything that's going on.  We don't know how lucky we are to be gamma babies.  I would imagine that there would be quite the market for blow-up doll people.  You can do anything anything anything anything to them and they will never communicate about your crimes.  We can keep them in government institutions or sell them in the private market.  NZ is the best place in the world to come and do things like that.  Right, Jacinda?  Nobody was ever prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus.  Nobody was prosecuted for sexually molesting patients when they had been anesthetised for unrelated procedures (they go on about unauthorised cervical exams but implanting embryos and removing embryos when they are viable outside the womb as Fisher and Paykal incubator babies, maybe let's try and see)...  NZ is the best place in teh world to come and live out all of those fantasies (I think the Diablo people would put it like that).  So we can understand the nature of the competition.  The lengths that some people will go to to ensure that the likes of Dr Leeks and Professor Glue are the only game in town.  Why they reappoint judges not via proper process at all (e.g., Justice Toogood was not appointed by proper process).  Una Jagose publically admitted to her role in refusing to prosecute wrongdoing.  Throwing evidence away.  ordering obstruction of justice throwing away evidence.  Corruption.  There are none so blind as those who will not see.  </p>

                           <p>Presumably there isn't anything wrong with the reading comprehension of the leaders of the US and so on.  But who knows.  COrnell doesn't seem capable of processing applications to enrol.  Why do they acknowledge NZ as a country when they can read the Australian constitution?  Where is Jacinda anyway.  Who voluntarily chooses to walk away from her pay cheque?  She can't be employed to teach at Harvard on the back of a 3 year con-munications degree from Waikato, surely.  But then Ashley Bloomfield was re-deployed to University of Auckland Professor when he never applied to PhD, never wrote a doctoral thesis, never was examined for one.  Doesn't have a research output.  He's a medical doctor -- right?  A medical graduate who was acknowledged as graduated.  But they will not register him to see patients and he sees no patients.  That sounds right.  They will never pay him to work the job for which he trained.  They will re-deploy him only to ensure that he takes up a place or position ensuring that nobody works that job, either.  There's nothing here.</p>

                           <p>kim.com should have been extradited to stand trial in the US under Australian Law.  The courts refused to extradite him.  He pays the NZ courts, he pays the NZ courts, he pays the NZ courts.  THey order re re re re re re filing and more and more money to be paid to the NZ courts.  They say NZ doesn't have the laws to extradite him.  Australia does.  But the Federal courts of Australia refuse to acknoweldge or process filings from NZ . They say they don't have jurisdiction because the only people they would put on payroll are too f*cking stupid to parse the Australian Constitution, one can only suppose.  </p>

                           <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/pou-tiaki/132060879/calls-to-make-education-more-affordable-for-pacific-island-students  The University of Waikato was going to hold me indefinately under 'zero fees' (as a MPhil Student).  That's what their award winning in-house counsel (Shelley-Slade Gully) wrote to me.  That the University was going to keep me enrolled under the zero fee scheme until the externals signed off on completion of my qualification (which the University never intended to allow them to do).  They aren't even trying to follow the Statutory law, at all.  NZ Universities were responsible for training and graduating Pacifica Nurses.  Right?  Arranging for them to mix MMR vaccines with expired anasthetic solution and sending them to the Pacific Islands to administer ineffective vaccines that even resulted in wrongful death of infants they were given to.  THey were NZ trained and NZ graduated nurses.  Correct?  Who were trained and graduated and registered and shipped to Samoa to cause wrongful deaths of infants.  THey never would have graduated or registered or employed them otherwise.  Not even trying to be fair.  The Government does not 'subsidise the costs' of domestic studnets.  The government keeps domestic students doing all of the work for none of the money.  Will not sign off on compeltion fo their training.  Will not publically advertise jobs.  Won't follow proper process on employments. </p>

                           <p>THey won't get graduate studnets work out to external examiners.  It doesn't matter how much you pay them -- they just won't do it.  THe number of PhD studnets I know who were required to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay considerable fees in excess.  Considerable time in excess.  They refuse to process their work.  Refuse to get it to externals.  THey just wont' do it.  They'll wrongful death the studnets before they will graduate them.  The f*cking free-rider incompetents on payroll.  WHo don't even have a research output.  Only reason tehy are on payroll to to wrongful f*cking death howevr many others.  F*cking psychopaths.  Not even trying to be fair.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  What research output of the University?  Where is it?  What Univesrity?  Nobody home.  NOthing there.  Not even trying to have an education and training system.  Murder off all the people willing and able to do the f*cking work until you've got your slave prison detention camps.  Ruled over by f*cking incompetents.  Where is the research output?  One f*cking job to do..  Where is your research output??? </p>

Now the commissioner can get busy hiring 2 pedophiles to replace the one they had to let go.  That'll teach them for complaining!  </p>
