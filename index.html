 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>
<p>This website documents how Australasia decided to stop having Universities in favor of having unlawful detention camps where they have people working as forced volunteers or slaves or whatever you want to call it.  It documents how they (1) refuse to enrol students (particularly domestic adults) in programmes of the students choosing because they believe they know  better than the student what qualification is right for them.  They make these decisions on non-academic grounds.  For example, making decisions about certain students needing to be enrolled in what they consider 'low value qualifications' because they have decided on the basis of information they have collected (e.g., race, decile or socio-economic status rating of the students parents, socio-economic status rating of the students high school).  
</p>

<p>The website documents how they refuse to get graduate research to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit the work being examined by international community where independent examiners who don't know anything about the students socio-economic status or race or age or for how many decades the student has been forced to keep slaving for the university because the university refuses to get their work out to external examiners for examination because they have decided to traffick in slaves, only.</p>

<p>From supervisors simply refusing to do the job for which they are paid (refusing to supervise the student) to supervisors only playing a prevention and prohibition and stabotage role (instructing the student to make changes that were different from those required by external examiners that were likely to make the thesis less likely to be acceptable to international community) to the university simply refusing to get work to externals.  To the University keeping false enrolment records (recording enrolment in courses the student never applied to be enrolled in) to keeping false transcripts (recording false enrolment details and recording that a student was forced to '...' continue the programme under re-enrolment else 'F' was failed by the university for the programme -- because the university refused to get the students work out to external examiners.</p>

<p>This webiste documents how both the Australian National University and The University of Waikato refuse to get my research work out to externls.  ANU refused to supervise (apparently they don't have anybody employed in the philosophy programme to supervise graduate research) and Waikato did not really supervise ('I'm off on my holiday now see ya!!') and then instructed me to make changed different from the ones the externals required.  E.g., externals required changes to the substance within 10 weeks and the univeristy refused to get the thesis that I supplied within 10 weeks out to externals. They recorded I re-enrolled for six additional months before they would get the thesis out to externls.  Then when the external examiner (the only examiner outside the southern hemisphere) stated they wanted an oral examination (to see why the university was failing me) they recorded on my transcript that I failed.</p>

<p>The Australian Natioanl University would not accept my complaint to them.  They asked me to revise and resubmit my complaint 3 times and then they instructed me to rewrite my complaint clearer because they hadn't accepted that they received a complaint from me.</p>

<p>They have all had every opportunity to put things right internally and they refuse.  Australiasia does not have tertiary education.  They have a system of slavery and detention camps only.
    </p>

<p>If you look at how this part of the world advertises jobs and fails to fill them with people willing and able to do the job (in favor of people who will keep some segment of society in conditions of deprivation and abuse, effectively) then you can see the race to the bottom that is Australasia.  They don't appear to have any kind of self-preservation instict or desire at all.</p>

<p>The Judiciary also fails to function.  You can see over on the Judicial Review page that they do not appear to be willing and / or able to output a sensible judgment.  The one or two that I received from the courts early on were over-turned.  I was informed that the landlord (who intentionally wired a house to be a fire hazard) has subsequently moved to Queensland so he can continue on his good works over there.</p>

<p>There is nothing in Australasia.  Or, there is nothing for me in Australasia.  They like to exterminate people when it comes time to pay them.  Trying to be like the USA around the time when the endentured servants arrived and happened to die of maleria (shall we say) when it was time for them to be paid for the work that they had done.  It is in the Australian Constitution that NZ is a sate of australia but NZ and Australia both refuse to accept that.  Australia will not supply voting papers to NZ and they try and keep NZ as a detention camp for Australia where the idea seems to be that by treating people as badly as they can they will somehow motivate and inspire people to want to move to Australia.  That seems to be the reward granted to people who have exterminated enough New Zealanders.  For example, Kim Sterelny, after all the work he did undermining the Victoria University of Wellington (I would imagine it's about double or triple billing for keeping students enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and asisgnign credit for some peoples work to other people and so on) he got appointed to roll out the same dis-establishment campaign for the ANU.  So that now the administration says they don't have the willingness or ability to supervise gaduate research in teh philosophy programme.  For example, Harlene Hayes.  All the work she did culminating in her refusing to sign off on completion of qualification for 1/3rd the medical cohort in Otago (refusing to acknowledge that they'd been signed off as having completed their internships at the places the univesrity arranged and approved for them to do their internships in).  Her reward for undermining Medicine at Otago (such that a bunch of non-graduates are not-paid they pay the university they pay the university they pay the university to 'work' in our hospitals) is that she now gets to go roll out the same stabotage and undermining plan for the University of Western Australia.
</p>

<p>Apparently they don't need to sign me off becuase there never will be a job for me.  But lots of people they have signed off, there aren't jobs for them.  I mean, New Zealand never really acknowledged ANU graduates.  And also never really graduated it's own people.  Never really acknowledged it's own graduates.  But now the idea/l is that people from NZ who have already been picked to lead on personal (e.g., political) grounds can simply be given (or simply buy) honorary degrees from Harvard, for example.  That will be acknowledged only insofar as they were paid for or brought or purchased for all the wrong (non-academic) reasons.  That appears to be the value of a qualification.  That is to say, there is no value to the qualification.  Except that the people picked for all the wrong reasons feel less threatened, now, that they have the fancy titles.  That they are the only ones with the fancy titles.  And then everyone will catch on that the fancy titles don't mean anything...  And then maybe there can be such a thing as academics gain once the people who didn't want to do it anyway all piss off and go do whatever it is that they value.</p>

<p>Well, this is the story brought to you by the USA.  Right?  So we are all supposed to spend how many years working for the USA, then, so they can collect up all the work for you when you are a (documetned or partially documented or not documeted at all) 'student'.  Hey, I know..  How about you do a lot of 'work' to upload to your CV on github.  Just do a bunch of unpaid work for free and then they will pay you later.  Promise.  Pinkie swears it.  No?  I mean, they have already decided who is to be on payroll on quite independent grounds.  So far as I can see...</p>

<p>What do they value?  Best I can see they value 'party party party'.  That's a good reason to go to the Australian Natioanl University.  Right?  We can spend out time dressing up to have a party and upload a lot of photos on the internet to motivate and inspire a bunch of tourists to edu-tourism to the university to pay money for accommodation in the area and so on.  That seems like a great plan for a functioning university.  It can be known as party party party university.  People can just hang out...  And people can come here and maybe even steal or simply be given, all voluntary-like, I suppose, the creative outputs of the people that Australia considers low-value and go pass them off as their own works back home.  Maybe even find a wife?  No?  SUmmer girlfriend, then?  What is the function of the Australian National University when its own administration asserts it does not have anybody willing or able to supervise philosophy employed in the philosophy programme?  If they aren'w willing or able to supervise philosophy then why don't they stand down?  Apparently there are soooooooooooo many people who would give their eye teeth to be employed in philosophy... Or was that give their eye teeth to party party party party with the kiddies the philosophers picked out to enrol?  SOmething more along those lines, then...</p>

<p>I have put a lot of my work up on this website because I don't know who may have been passing it off as their own.  It is work that I distributed widely at conferences and the like.  I gave people write-ups of my talk as hand-outs.  None of my supervisors ever suggested that I submit anything to any journal so I never did that.  In fact they said something about 'imagine if every student submitted their work to journals, imagine how inundated the journals would be...'  I took it that they meant I should not do that.  I see now that that's how various people pass themselves off as productive.  Finding out who wrote the anonymous review article, I would suppose, and, if they are a student, saying that the work has no merits.  Then, once the studnet has been bullied into fleeing passing the students work off as their own.  I guess that's why Sterelny would say 'I don't acknowledge anything I have written that is more than 3 years old'.  That way it makes it easier for people to do that.  That's why they don't want oral examinations.  They only want people to be part of the scummy scummy scam.  </p>

<p>I don't know for how long the University of Waikato has been at it.  I remember Ben Gibbs resigned when I was an undergrad or honors student, I think.  He resigned over them refusing to get a history students PhD thesis out to external examiners.  The University said they were justified refusing to do that (and recording he failed on his transcript) because they had had  yakkity yak yak yak amongst themselves and decided that they thought his work was a neo-Nazi manifesto.  So they were not going to send it out to be externally examined.  Gibbs said that whether they were correct or not in it being a neo-Nazi manifesto was irrrelevant to wheher the work was of sufficient academic quality to be granted a PhD.  The acadmeic work was supposed to be exmined on it's academic merits and the University of Waikato was refusing to function as a university.  Keeping people hostages and refusing to allow them to do academic work.  I wanted to get away from the Waikato once I heard that, particularly.  Because I was concerned that staying in the Waikato meant they would similarly treat me.  So I went to the ANU.  And so they sent Sterelny after me to send me back without my qualification.  So I said I didn't want to do Philosophy (apparently it's sooooo competitive peple will give their eye teeth)...  I wanted to re-train in Medicine.  Since there is a appentiseship system there, apparently.  And clearly none whatsover in philosophy.  But it's like Homer Simpson is the peson in charge of the quality and integrity of our hospital system or something and he will only train Bart.  Partly because he trusts that Bart will not expose his incopmetence or ineptitude.  So we wait for the whole f*cking thing to implode.</p>

<p>Now the judiciary is imploding.  They don't seem to be willing or able to do their jobs either.  The Attorney General and the Director General of Health don't seem willing or able to do their half a million dollar per year jobs...  The New Zealand Vice Chncellor's Committee throws away complaints only and the Judge says he can do whatever he likes because he writes the laws.  He doesn't write the Statutory laws that give him a statutory function.  But he was responsibel for writing local policy to uphold our internationl obligations to protext whistleblowers.  They think that by refusing to employ people (keeping them as slaves) they don't have to protect them, though.  That's partly why they refuse to employ them.  That way there can be no whistleblowers.  See?  It's ingenous in psychopath land.  There is nothing in Australasia.  Unless you want to be a wrongful deathbringing pedophile who can be sooooooooooo charming and put on a fancy suit and party party party party party keep a bunch of slaves or keep people in coniditions of deprivation so you can take all of their stuff.  Seems to be what it is that we value.  </p>

<p>New Zealnd does not have an education and training system at all.  I don't see that Australia does either.  Party party party let's have a party.  Does teh USA?  I don't know.  UNC has me there for 1 year semi-documented.  That is to say I had a J1 visa to do some teaching (equivalent of their graduate students) while my student enrolment in Australia was put on hold and I was allowed to attend courses...  Whether I was supposed to hand them written work (for no credit) was not clear or obvious to me.  I chose to write for cognitive neuropsychology (I've put that writing up on the writing page) but I did not do philosophy writing for the university since I was not going to be credited with any of it.  But that was the pln for me.  Right?  I was just supposed to give all my 'work' away..  Like I'm doing now.  Right?  </p>

<p>
When Australasia cry cry cry cry cry that it doesn't have any people to do x what that usually means is that they refuse to pay anybody with the knowledge and skills and ability and even the training (insfar as there is anyting other than Homer Simpson trying to stay on payroll for as long as possible)...  There is actually nothing to work for.  Nothing worth working for.  Nothing nothing nothing  at all.  They lack honesty and they lack integrity.  The Judiciary itself lacks honesty and integrity.  They pretend or actually are unwilling and or unable to understand the conception of justice or fairness.  There is nothing.  Nothing nothing nothing nothing at all.  Unless you like to party party party, of course.  Find some vulnerable person so you can take everything from them and feel great about yourself.
