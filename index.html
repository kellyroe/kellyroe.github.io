                            <p> <a href="writing/LAW 121B.pdf" target="_self">Law exam.</a>  </p>

                            <p>I wish I kept copies of the Population / Public Health essays that I wrote that were awarded 30 per cent only (I was failed for the entire course).  I personally don't think that they were appreciably worse than anything else I had done...  And I don't think that is coming from a position of bias.</p>

                            <p>Why did they fail me?  Because...  I didn't realise before-hand but the Population / Public Health pathway was a Maaori Pathway.  They had the people picked out who they wanted to do Medicine from that Pathway and they did not pick me.  Since I was passing Organic Chemistry etc they thought that the only way they could stop me taking what they believed they were entitled to was by failing me for the course -- so they could say that since I failed the course I was 'ineligible' to have applied.</p>

                            <p>At the end of the semester I dropped papers from the second semsester so I would end up with less than 120 points in that academic year.  That way I preserve my full time GPA.  But that was what they tried to do to me.  Ruin my GPA.  By failing me for Population / Public Health.  They forced me to flee the 'University'.  That is what University grades mean, according to them. They are discretionary things with no meaning.  </p>

                            <p>In other words..  I suppose the only reason why I got first in class for the law exam was because I was enrolled in it as a general education paper (rather than as part of first year law) and they wanted to claim me.  They thought that I should pay and pay and pay and pay the 'University' so that they could...  Eventually...  Refuse to give me a law degree.  Else refuse to register me as a lawyer.  Else refuse to pay me as a lawyer.  You know how it goes.  You pay and you pay and you pay and you pay the 'University' until it is time for you to go away.  Because of all the 65 +++ year olds on payroll, still, and all the Americans who they see fit to give the NZ jobs to because there aren't any people here willing or able to be on payroll to do skilled jobs.</p>

                            <p>For example.  Brett Calcott married an American.  She was given employment by the University of Auckland so that she is paid to teach and research in Philosophy of Biology.  Why didn't they hire Brett (the NZ citizen) to work that job?  Or why didn't they hire Ben (the NZ citizen) to work that job?  Or why didn't they hire John Matthewson (the NZ citizen) to work that job?  Why did they choose to hire an American?  I thought we were only supposed to hire foreigners when there isn't anyone from NZ willing or able to work the job.  What was wrong with the NZers?  I'm pretty sure that any of them would have really really really wanted that job.  It would have given Brett financial independence...  Though, I don't know about Brett...  Is the idea that everybody sends their work to Kim Sterelny in his capacity as editor of the Philosophy of Biology journal..  Then he can delay publication until the people not already on payroll give up and go away or die or whatever.  Then he can reattribute authorship to people already on payroll. Or maybe reattribute authorship to the people he likes to party with, or something.  I mean to say, maybe Brett doesn't really have Phlosophy output.  Maybe he just does webpage stuff so that they can take take take the research outputs of some and reattribute them then to people who don't have the willingness or ability or whatever to have research output to record research output against their name.  I don't know.  It's soooo competitive, apparently.  Soooo competitive I should be run out of town!!</p>
