    <p>Universities think that they have discretion to give or withhold qualifications for arbitrary (non-academic) reasons.  I have several theses over on the writing page and the Australian National University and the Univesrity of Waikato simply refuse to employ people willing and / or able to supervise graduate student research and refuse to get work that has been submitted for external examination out to external examiners so they can prevent and prohibit timely completion so they can collect more and more and more and more money for having the student enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled.  That is or means to say the Universities of Australasia are not functioning as Universities.  They are functioning as prison, detention, or slave camps.
    </p>

    <p>This matters because various 'skilled profesions' like teaching (from early childhood through to graduate research', law, (lawyers, judges), nursing, medicine...  So many things...  So many things...   You are required to go off to university to be put to work, effectively 'just get in there and have a go' with assessments and examinations designed to force re-enrollment and re-enrollment and re-enrollment.  They put you to work and get you paying the university for your 'training' while they put you to work.  You pay the university you pay the university the government pays the university the government pays the university to keep you a hostage in detention a slaving for the university and the public sector while they pay you next to nothing at all.  You pay the university you pay the university you pay the university so they can employ people unwilling and / or unable to supervise graduate student research.  Unwilling and or unable to examine studnets work on the  basis of it's academics.  So they can refuse to examine some studnets work because they have decided that they prefer to keep the slave a slaving.  </p>

    <p>It seems there are people who, after about 45 years of lucrative government payroll, don't want to retire.  They want to keep on getting payrise after payrise after payrise to be the 'only game in town'.  So, however many generations of other people are required to not have jobs at all or not have qualifications at all so the univesrity can collect up more and more and more and more money for keeping hostages, effectively, refusing to examine their work, refusing to get their work to externals to preven them examining the work, refusing to graduate studnets who have met requirements, and, as if that wasn't enough, handing out qualifications on arbitrary grounds or arbitrary basis (so many 'honorary degrees') to the children of the administration.  Else selling the qualifications to the highest bidder, or similar.  False positives.  And false negatives.  No signal.  Nothing to see.  Nothing nothing nothing at all. </p>

    <p>I've posted much of my work here because I don't know what's happened to it.  If others are passing it off as their own (if it was given away for others to claim credit for) or if it was censored and whitewashed (e.g., what the NZ government seemed to do with my thesis on 'disability and equity in medicine and public health' choosing to commission other parties to get a report done (only under conditions of lateness).  I still don't have credit for the 1 year of research that I did.  Even when they forced re-enrollment nd I did everything they said working for 2 years on it they still wouldn't give me the qualification.  What a f*cking fare of a joke.  They couldn't even get to external examiners with instructions for them to examine it for the correct degree (that is or means to say the degree I actually applied to be enrolled in).  They record that I was enrolled in various things that I never even applied to be enrolled in.  That is or means to say the government is keeping false records about student enrollments in public universities.  It is keeping false transcripts about them.  It is keeping false accounts with respect to levels of student debt by recording students were enrolled in various things they never even applied to be enrolled in.  Double biling.  And so on.  It's all just a scummy scummy scam.</p>

    <p>The 'health profession' is non-functional to non-existent  because they refuse to process or progress applications to various training programmes.  They throw away applications from domestic adults (who have attained the age of 20 years and are eligible to be enrolled in the programme they have applied to by statute) so as to enrol 18 and 19 year olds (who are entitled to free secondary education until they are 20) into university qualifications so they can record levels of debt against their name for programmes of study of the universities choosing when the university then withholds graduation because they refuse to accept they were signed off on the internships they were sent off to so they can 'work' in the NZ hospital system without MBChB qualifications as 'junior doctors' while the student pays the university, pays the university, pays the university.  When the 'student' stops paying the university then it is time for the student to go away.  To be replaced with a 18 or 19 year old to get in there and have a go at abortions or euthanasias, or whatever.  To follow orders or instructions to do what management says when management says because management says.  To, effectively, 'work' in the hospitals while never stopping paying the university.</p>

    <p>The judges are not being appointed by the proper process.  Recently a bunch of retired judges were pulled out of retirement to, for example, investigate the 'unexplained' sudden death of Mason Pendrous.  I exhausted internal complaints resolution process with various of the NZ Universities. I have also exhausted internal complaints resolution process with the AUstralian National Univesrity who is also not properly processing applications to enrol, refusing to employ people willing and or able to supervise graduate research, refusign to acknowledge receipt of and refusing to process or progress complaints about serious wrongdoing within the univesrity by stating that the student is required to revise and resubmit the complaint, revise and resubmit the complaint, revise and resubmit the complint.  I have provided the Vice Chancellor of the ANU 4 statemetns of my complaint (on his instructions, since the complaints went to the office) and they refuse to progress or process or acknolwedge the complaints.  Garbage garbage garbage.  There aren't Universities..  Detention slave camps up and down the land.  The qualifications cannot mean anything because they are not processing the academics.  They are giving training places and qualifications to the children of the administration etc.  That's how you end up with so many incompetents as Bart Simpson (for example) is the only person who Homer Simpson will allow to be the next safety inspector of the power plant facility.  Things go nuclear, indeed, eventually.  I mean, what did they think was going to happen?</p>

    <p>Of course the judiciary cannot function because the judges were appointed because of why?  And the only people who are acknowledged as having law qualifications are...  ANd it's just a big hoax of a scummy scam and there's really nothing here.  Nothign nothing nothing at all.  No health system.  No education and training system or programme.  No functioning judiciary.  I don't know why anybody would think that the financial institutions would be competent or work when nothing else seems to.  Crown Law refuses to prosecute statutory violation or wrongdoing.  Meredith Connell (the Central Auckland firm that has monopoly on Crown Law prosecutions) claims that since it functions not only as public prosecutor but also as a private firm they have a bunch of conflicts such that they cannot function or act as public prosecutors against various parties.  Una Jagose and David Parker refuse to instruct Crown Law to prosecute the executive for statutory violation.  Refuse to prosecute the University of Waikato for keeping false records, and so on.  Misuse of official thesis documents (giving the work to third parties overseas and recording that the student has been failed from NZ university so that overseas can re-attribute the work to someone over there, presumably).  Apparently it is my slave job, now, that I can take various of the executive to court for their sttutory violations.  The civil court.  The judges don't seem willing or able to understand that the evidential bar on civil proceedings is lower.  The judges don't seem willing or able to acknowlege receipt of evidence supplied.  The judges don't seem willing or able to acknowledge the half of the statutory laws that describe duties or obligations of the executive to do a job according to a job description.  They interpret the laws as conferring unlimited power to the government to do anything they like against the people.  I mean to say the public institutions, in NZ, are government institutions of abuse against the people.  There are no social services in NZ.  The government won't pay anybody to work those jobs (will not accept applications, will not process or progress applications, will not enrol or employ, will not pay anybody to learn that or work that job).  There is nothing in Australasia.  It is just a social experiment in the deconstruction of society.  The leaders take themselves to be leading a prison or detention camp.  That is how they choose to govern.  We will get people from overseas (e.g., the recently appointed VC of Auckland is not a NZer) to take up high paid government jobs -- but only if they work to keep NZers imprisoned or detained.  There is nothing here.</p>

    <p>The Australian Constitution states quite clearly that NZ is a state of Australia.  Australia refuses to acknowledge or uphold it's own constitution.  It withholds federal election voting papers from New Zealanders.  It refuses to supply Australian birth certificiates and passports.  It refuses to supply or progress applications from New Zealanders to work some governmetn jobs in Australia.  It treats New Zealanders (people born there through no fault of their own) as second or third class Australaians refusing to accept that they have the rights that Australalians do.  But then they don't seem to treat many of the Australians any better, actually, with all of the honorary Medical Degrees going to the children of the administration on non-academic grounds, and so on.  New Zealand is now looking at giving the vote to 16 year olds.  It is true that 16 year olds do not have their childrens rights upheld in NZ (e.g., the right to be free from abuse, the right to a free secondary school education and so on) and many of them are put to 'work' to support their families, even, as employers will prefer to hire 16 year olds and replace them with new 16 year olds every year so as to pay the least amount of wages possible.  There is a process to be followed if Australia wants to change the constitution to remove New Zealand from being a State.  They refuse to follow the process because they are above their own constitution when it comes to their unlimited rights to detain Australasians and keep them as hostages or slaves.  The New Zealand courts also don't seem willing and / or able to uphold the laws of New Zealand.  They refuse to process filings, now, in order to junk up the courts with issues like 'should 16 year olds be allowed to vote since they have been consented by the government to be consented for sexual activity and put to work in the name of 'education and training'' and so on.  It is clear that children don't have any rights in New Zealand and the way forwards for New Zealand is, apparently, to declare adulthood at a younger and younger age since the early onset dementia and Alzheimers type of prion diseases of oxygen deprivation and traumatic brain injury and the like are set to reach epidemic and also endemic proportions as we work so very very very hard to breed an underclass of gamma babies to serve the world.  That seems to be the aspirational goal of the leaders of New Zealand and also Australasia.  The leaders don't seem to value the people very much.  The elite white minority.  I guess nobody was held to account for atrocities around the end of WWII and they never stopped, in these parts.</p>
