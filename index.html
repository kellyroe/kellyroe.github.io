 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">

                            <p>Here is the grand scheme for 'stupid university'.  It goes like this.  Only enrol students whose parents paid a bribe to have them enrolled.  Only pass studnets who paid a bribe to get the answers to the test questions.  And so on...  Only progress the most corrupt.  Why? Because they just keep handing over money.  Also because you can call them out and end them at any point in time.  So, no harm.  Right?  You can only enrol the liars and cheats, only progress the liars and cheats.  Only graduate the liars and cheats.  Only employ the liars and cheats.  When do you want to call them out, then?  When it's time to pay them?  Or maybe you will keep paying them to lie and to cheat...  How many will they murder death kill..  How many wrongful deaths?  How many sexual violations?  How many can we get them to march off to the death camps to preserve their way of life etc etc?  What is it that we most value in Australaisa?  What seems to be the case?  All and only those who did not do their own work.  Who stole the work of others and passed that off as their own.  Most valued, apparently.  Garbage garbage garbage land.</p>

                            <p>Where is your Phd Thesis that you wrote Ashley Bloomfield?  I heard they hired you as Professor.  Where is your research thesis that you wrote???  Where is it?  Your 3 year research output ? Where did it go?  What are you doing now, Jacinda?  Did you apply to be enrolled in a programme of study?  Did you pay the enrolment fees?  Really?  Where is your application to enrol?  let's see?  Let's see your applicatoin on it's academic merits.  You got accepted to Harvard?  On the basis of qualifications completed more than 5 years ago?  Really?  You got employed as a paid person there?  Really?  Where is your application to work there?  Didn't your 3 year con-munications Degree from Waikato expire already?  What quality and integrity?  There's nothing there.  Nobody home.  Corruption.  Corruption.  Corruption.  COrruption.  Can't even won't even calculate my GPA.  Can't even won't even acknoweldge my qualifciations.  Steal my work and won't credit me.  Psychopaths.  F*cking psychopaths.  F*cking stupid imbecil retarded f*cking morons.  Nobody else acknowleged as having applied.  F*cking stupid retards take everything because they are f*cking too f*cking stupid to do anything at all. F*cking stupid retard-land.  No speak English.  Constitution brierhirkgjhr fidsfhisdhgukrsfjdghjk no spik engleeeesh.  Comprehend.  aye?   duuuuuh...</p>

                            <p>Ooh.  So apparently the stupid-versity of Otago needs to re-enroll the re-enrollment of the re-enrollments because otherwise nobody would have voluntarily signed up for Microsoft 365.  Or similar.  Not voluntarily.  But they can of course roll all the thesis work back and see the slaves that the 'stupid-versity' keeps. Re-enrolling the re-enrollments so that Professor Glue can keep the Professor Glue Factory.  Giving LSD to people kept in State Care.  Without a prescription (LSD is not a prescription medicine) and prescription medicines are not available to the property of the NZ Governnmetn (new manus island detention camp of Australia).  Nobody home. Knock knock.  Nothing there.</p>

                            <p>One of the most commonly listed jobs, in NZ (actually 'jobs') is 'recruitment advisor' or similar.  The position description seems to involve 1 person being paid to advertise and re-advertise and re-advertise.  Interview and re-interview.  Make yourself available for prospective employee inquiries.  Yakkity yak yak yak about employment opportunities.  Collect up all the information about prospective employees.  Who may have been abused in state care?  Who might have a disability?  Who can be persuaded and convinced doesn't actually have any skills.  It's sooooo competitive.  Maybe they can be persuaded to do a 2 week or a 4 week or a several decades long trial.  A volunteering experience.  Maybe you can even convince or persuade people that they are required to indefinately volunteer otherwise the government will give them to someone they are required to sleep over with.  That's a good idea.  You can divide the country into two classes of people.  The people on payroll to 'recruit' the 'recruits' by advertising and readvertising the marketing management of the administration of I'm on payroll.  And look what you are on payroll to do!  Of course...  Do they really pay you, to work that job?  That's a job, there..  I bet you need to re-enrol in the degrees in order to get a job like that.  Pay the university.  Maybe volunteer your time for several decades to see if you are a good fit for the position.  Just keep paying.  Just keep paying.  Just keep making up fake jobs to make it look like NZ isn't just a slave prison detention camp.  By the time they've given all the jobs to people who know full well they are only deployed onto the positions to ensure that the statutory function is not performed by them...  Is not performed by anyone... Well, that's the function of NZ.  Right?  New Manus Island for Australia.  What part of 'it is in your constitution that NZ is a State in the Federation of Australia' is so hard to understand?  What is the f*cking problem?  Psychopaths.  There's nothing there.</p>

                            <p>What education system?  They can't / won't process applications to enrol or completions of training.  What health system?  They don't seem to have any doctors.  They aren't advertising for any.  They blackbird for 'no speak english' and when it's time to pay them it's time for them to go away.  Be deported or held in one of the state institution of abuse prison detention camps of NZ.  'Hospitals'.  'Prisons'.  'Schools'.  Let the UN inspectors in and see how the people are not supposed to be there.  Being unlawfully detained in conditions of torture.  New Manus Island.  There's nothing here.  What judiciary?  The Australian Federal Court wrongly claims it doesn't have jurisdication.  The Australian Federal Court doesn't seem willing and / or able to understand it's own Constitution.  What a farce.  Must be the 'Australian English'.  Or maybe it's the 'Australian Values'.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>I am working on updating this site.</p>

                            <p>I got this site up relatively quickly so that I would have a place to show my work.</p>

                            <p>You can see, from here, that I wrote a 50,000 word MA thesis for University of Waikato.</p>

                            <p>I then went to the Australian National University from 2006.</p>

                            <p>You can see the seminars I wrote and presented at conferences (write-ups are available on the seminars page, and also powerpoint presentations that I distributed printed versions of).</p>

                            <p>You can even see a more than 100,000 word thesis document that I gave to my supervisor and the university administration.</p>

                            <p>Turns out that universities get more and more and more and more money for keeping studnets re re re re re re enrolled.</p>

                            <p>I wanted to do Medicine rather than work as a Philosophy academic.  It was not enjoyable being a PhD student where my supervisor didn't actually do  his job of supervising me, at all.  What evidence do I have of that?  Well, you can see the work I did.  What work did he do?  Where is evidence of him meeting with me?  Telling me what to read?  Where are comments on my work?  When did he get my work out for external examination?</p>

                            <p>I returned to NZ because I wanted to do Medicine and go on to become a Medical Doctor.  Psychiatry, maybe.</p>

                            <p>University of Auckland told me that I needed to complete a new qualification from a NZ University.  I applied to do a 1 year MPhil with University of Waikato in 2018 (120 points MPhil with 05 March start date).  I told them I wanted to complete the 120 point 1 year MPhil in 1 year so I could study Medicine with Auckland in 2019.  The University of Waikato had a yakkity yak yak yak meeting, then, and decided amongst themselves that that was impossible.  They would not allow it.  They then refused to enrol me in the programme I applied to, enrolled me in programmes I never applied to (with very different enrolment dates over more than 1 year), refused to get work I had done out to externals, refused to allow externals to sign off on the qualification completion etc etc etc.  They ended up keeping false enrolment records and false transcripts.  They recorded that I had been failed for qualifications that I had never even applied to be enrolled in!</p>

                            <p>You can see the 14 September 2018 thesis that they never got to externals.  You can see the 05 October under 50,000 word 120 point one year 1 EFT Masters thesis that they sent out with instructions that it be externally examined as a up to 100,000 word 360 point three year 3 EFT doctoral thesis.  You can see that the examiners kept that thesis, then, though they were required to say that insofar as it was acceptable (as a doctoral thesis) it would need changes to the substance.  The Uni calendar says that when substantive changes are required before it is accepted either (1) the examiners will return the thesis and the student will have another 6 months enrolment (followed by another 3 months re-examination) else (2) the examiners will keep the thesis and the substantive changes are to be completed within 10 weeks.  The examiners kept the thesis.  Within 10 weeks I supplied the University with a 05 January 2019 version that had been substantively changed.  They refused to get that to examiners.  Within 10 weeks I also supplied the University with a 24 February 2019 version that had been substantively changed and they refused to get that to examiners.  On instructions from the Research Dean I wrote extensive commentary explaining how I couldn't make all the changes the NZ examiner (particularly) suggested since I was only enrolled in a 50,000 word 1 year MPhil and not a 100,000 word 3 year PhD.  I had done all the changes I could be expected to do within 10 weeks while keeping the document within the required length of under 50,000 words.  The University refused to get the commentary to externals. </p>

                            <p>They then kept me working for another year (another 6 months followed by another 3 month external examination) and when the overseas based external said I'd done a bunch of stuff he hadn't really asked for and asked for an oral defence they refused to schedule one and recorded on my transcript that I failed the qualification.</p>

                            <p>Meanwhile, the University of Auckland declined my application to Medicine in 2019 and again in 2020 on grounds I was 'ineligible to have applied' because they refused to accept that I'd successfully written a 120 point MPhil for Waikato in 2018.  I learned that the Education and Training Act states that domestic adults are eligible to be enrolled in whatever programme they have applied for,  by statute, however.  In other words, their decision to decline my application on grounds of 'ineligibility' was ultra vires.  They were required to process my application on the basis of it's academic merits, therefore.  They published a selection algorithm saying how full time GPA, UMAT / UCAT score, and interview score determine a ranking and places are offered to candidates on the basis of their rank order score.  They published an algorithm as to how they would calculate the full time GPA (last 2 years of graded full time study including summer school papers above stage one.  Best 120 points per year if more than 120 points per year were done).  According to this my GPA is 8.6.  They refused to calculate it correctly.  They refused to correct their wrongs.   </p>

                            <p>In both these cases (for both Universities) I exhausted internal complaints resolution process.  I also took the issue to the Ombudsman.  The Ombudsman wastes 1 year on an investigation and says a bunch of non-binding how he doesn't really see anything wrong.  The VC of Waikato told me to take them to court if I didn't like it.  I took them to court, therefore.  The University of Waikato (a public university of NZ) chose to spend tens of thousands of taxpayers dollars asserting their right to enrol students in programmes they never applied to, keep false records about them including false enrolment records and false transcripts, asserting their right to refuse to examine studnets work and arrange for them to be examined for the wrong qualification.  Auckland University (a public university of NZ) chose to spend tens of thousands of taxpayers dollars asserting their right to throw away applications to enrol from domestic adults (who are eligible by statute) on grounds of 'ineligibility' while they record increasing levels of debt against teenagers names preferentially enrolling them (since teenagers are entitlted to a free secondary education until they turn 20).</p>

                            <p>New Zealand has not paid out reparation for various cases of abuse in state care.  New Zealand does not see anything wrong with the likes of Dr Leeks abusing children in the name of psychiatry etc.  Look at all the work they do to ensure that the likes of Dr Leeks is the only game in town.  Throwing away applications from domestic adults in order to preferentially select teenagers to train them up to be the next bullies and abusers.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>It is in the Australian Constitution that NZ is a state of the Federation of Australia.  On grounds of expediency.  There has not been a vote to have NZ's status revoked.  Australia treats NZers as second or third class Australians.  I was not able to apply for Medicine in Australia because as a NZer I can only enrol in qualifications they consider 'low value' that Australians don't want to enrol in.  I can only hand over more and more and more work to the Australian National University for them to not credit me with, at all, so they can reattribute authorship of it to someone else.  So that various other people can collect up all the research funding, of course.  So they can have all of the money for not even doing their job of supervision when they don't even have any teaching requirement at all.</p>

                            <p>Corruption.  Corruption.  Corruption.</p>

                            <p>The NZ Judiciary reappointed Justice Toogood from retirement (not proper process for appointing Judges) and he couldn't see anything wrong.  Justice Fitzgerald awarded reduced costs against me for my being technically correct (in a technical matter of ultra vires decisions being made in a case of judicial review of administrative action).  Reduced costs against me for my being right.  Seriously???  They can't award me legal fees (I'm a slave to the courts) because I'm not a lawyer.  They can't award me costs because I'm not a lawyer.  They want to say (sometimes) that schedule 2B costs (for example) written into the back of the High Court Rules can only be awarded to people who have lawyers representing them.  Auckland University chooses to employ a senior partner and junior associate as well to represent them in the High Court Proceedings.  Ms Roe contacted more than 30 lawyers on the legal aid list for Auckland and they all claimed to be too busy else conflicted out else maintained that they couldn't see the merits of Ms Roe's case.  So Ms Roe is forced to represent herself.  The lengths the University of Auckland is prepared to go to in order to enrol the teenage children of the officials in the search for the next Dr Leeks.  Not even trying to be fair at all.</p>

                            <p>Ms Roe complained to the VC of the NZVCC that Waikato was keeping false enrolment records and false transcripts etc.  Chris Whelan refused to process her complaint.  He has the statutory function of processing whistleblower complaints.  Official Information Act Request shows that he hasn't processed a single complaint of wrongdoing against any of the NZ Universities since he was appointed to office in 2014.  He says he is inundated with complaints every year and he doesn't process any of them.  He has a stock standard response where he blames the complainant for having complained and he says that the problems are personal and particular to the complainant.  The High Court Judge asserted that Chris Whelan's job was actually to ensure that his statutory function is not filled by him, is not filled by anyone.  It would be ultra vires for Chris Whelan to fulfil his statutory function, asserts the High Court Judge.</p>

                            <p>Ms Roe did not get justice in the High Court.  Ms Roe therefore filed with the Court of Appeal.</p>

                            <p>The Court of Appeal says she's required to pay a total of tens of thousands of dollars security for costs so she doesn't have an 'unfair advantage' in litigation.  Ms Roe applies for security for costs to be waived since the cases she is filing are cases of judicial review of administratie action (to do with corruption within the Universities of NZ) and are matters of considerable public interest.  The Court of Appeal asserts and reasserts and reasserts that it does not see merits to the cases and that the matters are all very very very particular and very very very very personal to do with Ms Roe.  Ms Roe appeals this with the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court reasserts that there are no merits to Ms Roe's claims and things are very very very very particular and very very very very personal against Ms Roe.</p>

                            <p>Ms Roe applies for the Ministry of Social Development to provide advance benefit payment to cover the security for costs that has been set  by the Court of Appeal and upheld by the Supreme Court.  Ms Roe stated she understands there is no right to appeal in NZ, but there is the right to justice and justice has  not  been done in the High Court therefore the courts decided that an appeal was necessary.  The Ministry of Social Development declines the advance benefit payment on the grounds that the amount set by the High Court (upheld by the Supreme Court) is "too much" also on the grounds that there is no right to Justice for New Zealanders.  Ms Roe appeals this with the Benefits Review Committee which reasserts the Governments rights to deny justice to New Zealanders and Ms appeals this with the Social Security Appeals Authority.  More than 6 months later the Social Security Appeals Authority has still not issued a Judgment on whether Justice is an essential need for New Zealanders or whether Justice is simply optional or discreetionary.  The New Zealand courts still have not paid out any compensation at all to victims of abuse in State Care.  They don't think there is anything wrong with them choosing to hire people to abuse others in state care.  </p>

                            <p>New Zealand is not even trying to be fair.  Not even trying to have a university and training system.  Not even trying to have a functioning health system.  Not even trying to have a fucntioning judiciary.</p>

                            <p>AUstralia refuses to supply voting papers to New Zealanders.  Refuses to process NZers for Australian jobs (e.g., Government positions) for Australian education and training programmes (e.g., refuses HECS government loans for Medicine, etc).  Refuses to acknowledge that NZers are Australian Citizens.  Denies Australian passports and birth certificates.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>Australasia...  There's nothing here.  Garbage waste dump of a f*cking stupid-land of idiots.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>Ms Roe presents to the ED during the first Covid lock-down when the media is telling NZ that the GPs don't want to see patients because they don't have any face masks so you will need to go to the ED.  Also they are saying that nobody is presenting to the ED because people are too scared.  THey have never seen the ED so un-attended.  Ms Roe walked too much during the lock-down and ended up with an infected foot that she thought she might need antibiotics for.  She was also worried about hookworm after having walked barefooted in the Domain.  She was kept in seclusion for more than 24 hours before they got around to filling out the paperwork required for a 5 day observation hold.  Unlawfully detained without access to a lawyer, denied a phone call to police so she could inform them of her unlawful detention and get a duty lawyer.  She was kept for 5 days in the most secure environment (including unlawful use of seclusion).  Her file notes say she was forced to take prescription medication but her file notes also say that no medication had been prescribed.  She was then kept for several days after the 5 day hold expired where her file notes say that she did not want to stay so they were going to say that she was now a 'volunteer'.  That's what it means to be voluntary.  To be written up as having volunteered.  Whether you want to be or not.</p>

                            <p>Why?   Because the "hospital" gets more and more and more and more money for keeping the beds filled.  HOstages.  Slaves.  Prison.  Detention camps.  Not even trying to be fair.  What health system?  What education system? What judiciary?  There doesn't appear to be anything here.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>Ms Roe complained about the Auckland District Health Board having kept her unlawfully detained.  Judicial review of administrative action.  Removal from office of the most senior person responsible.  Apparently the most senior person responsible for understaffing the hospitals is Ashley Bloomfield in his capacity as health general (or whatever it was). Since then they have decided to make him a professor at the University of Auckland.  Professor.  Okay...  He never applied to do PhD, never wrote a PhD, has no research output.  So they put him on payroll as Professor, now.  They pay him hundred and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to ensure they don't have psychiatrists on payroll and they have a bunch of managers and administrators and so on ensuring the beds are fill and ACC is incorrectly billed for having the beds kept full.  People are paid to ensure the ED is full and patients are being ramped outside so they can ensure all the  beds are full at all times for maximum billings.  That way Ailsa Claire and various others can take hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year for themselves to employ people only to bully and abuse and torture and wrongful death and sexually offend against the people of NZ.  Not even trying to be fair.  </p>

                            <p>The Auckland District Health Board chose to hire a QUeens Counsel for themselves.  First they refused to supply Ms Roe with her file notes.  Said they had supplied them when they hadn't and so on.  So Ms Roe initiated court action against them claiming to have been unlawfully detained (before the observation section started and after it expired).  After they signed 'we have given you all the notes there are' I was able to be more specific in what there was evidence of.  For example, the nursing notes said I had been given prescription medication but there was no prescription.  The nursing notes said I was taken by a group or team of people into seclusion and told if I didn't take it by mouth voluntariliy they would inject me with it.  But they had no authority to give me the medication at all.  It requires a prescription and there was no prescriptin.  No medical doctor had signed that I was to be given medication at all.</p>

                            <p>The Queens Counsel counter-filed to have my filings thrown out without a substantive hearing.  The High Court Judge scheduled a 1/2 day hearing of his motion to have my filings thrown out without a trial.  In that 1/2 day hearing I had my file notes entered in as evidence of the DHB behaving unlawfully.  Unlawful detention.  Unlawful drugging.  Unlawful use of seclusion.  The High Court Judge then found that there was enough in the file notes to suggest that Ms Roe had a case against the DHB.  The High Court Judge then awarded costs against Ms Roe.  To repeat:  The High Court Judge did not up hold the motion to have proceedings struck out.  Proceedings were not struck out.  But Ms Roe was ordered to pay the costs involved in filing the motion to have proceedings struck out.  Instead of the ADHB being punished by the courts for taking an unnecessary step in the proceedings (wasting everybodies time with filing a motion to have proceedings struck out when the evidence that they tried to conceal from Ms Roe was that she had a case)...  The courts choose to punish the victims of the governements crimes.</p>

                            <p>The High Court Judge ordered Ms Roe to re-file her filings and refused to supply a court date for a substantive hearing of the issue Ms Roe filed.  Ordered Ms Roe to keep slaving for the courts and to pay the courts.</p>

                            <p>New Zealand is not rule by law.  Because the Judges are not ruled by law.  They refuse to uphold the law.  The "injustices" I have taken to calling them.  Not even trying to be fair.  There isn't anything here...</p>

                            <p>I also took the University of Otago to court because they are not processing applications to enrol in Medicine properly, either.  They tell domestic adults they are 'ineligible to apply' when the Education and Training Act states that they are in fact eligible by statute.  The Universities of NZ refuse to follow the statutory laws and the judges of the courts refuse to uphold the statutory laws by supplying teeth to violations.  The University of Otago asks people to declare various things when they apply to be enrolled in health qualifications.  THey ask whether they have been a 'victim' according to police.  They ask about present health conditions.  They ask about things like this..  Saying that it is so they can provide support that people need but they aren't using the information for the purposes of support (there is no affirmative action programme for victims of abuse in state care or for disability etc).  Rather, they are using the information to exclude otherwise qualified candidates.  This is because NZ doesn't have an education or health or whatever system. It has systems of abuse up and down the land.  Yet another institution of abuse set in place by the NZ government.  NO education and training system.  No hospitals.  No schools. No universities.  System of abuse up and down the land.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  We are soooooo lucky to be born in NZ.  We don't know how lucky we are!!!! I'm sooooo glad I was born a gamma baby I don't have to work half as hard as Lord Ashley declaring unlawful lockdowns...  Not even trying to be fair.  It's soooooo competitive, apparently.  Gnawing each others arms off.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>Apparently the thing is:  And now they pay me.  And now they pay me.  And now they pay me.  And now they pay me.  Only apparently I'm waiting for them to die, actually, so I can claw the money out of their grubby dead hands.  The only point of a qualification is that they pay you they pay you they pay you.  But however many people need to die before there will be any money for me.  Justice Toogood gets reappointed into position as Judge (how old his he?  75?) because he's got nothing to lose if he doesn't find in the interests of Justice, at all.  He got to have yet another day in court.  All eyes on him all eyes on him all eyes on him.  There will be Justice only over his dead body, apparently.  Which is why, of course, it takes a certain special snowflake to be handpicked out as special to go work in aged care.  There's really nothing here.</p>

                            <p>Oh, Ms Roe gets sent a bill, now.  From the New Government Health thing.  They keep sending her a bill saying she needs to pay them more than $10,000 dollars.  See, the High Court Judge ordered Ms Roe to pay the Auckland District Health Board more than $5,000 for them having chosen to hire a QC to file a motion to have her proceedings thrown out of court without a substantive hearing.  Then the Supreme Court ordered Ms Roe to pay another $5,000 to the ADHB for her appealing the costs judgment against her with the court of appeal.  Ms Roe tried to tell the court of appeal that 'costs following the judgment' means that since her proceedings were not thrown out she wins the substantive hearing of having her proceedings thrown out.  The f*cking dumb and dumber show.  I swear.</p>

                            <p>When Ms Roe gets sent a $10,000 bill from the Health Authority (the public health system of NZ) for them having unlawfully detained her in the "hospital"..  No, that's not right.  For her having complained to the courts of NZ that the hospitals are unlawfully detaining people in the "hospital"...  After Ms Roe having given them every opportunity to put things right from within... Ms Roe reports the spam to Apple.  What judiciary?  What health system?  What education system?  There isn't anything here.</p>

                            <p>Apparently Jacinda Ardern (the elected leader of NZ) is volunteering to be enrolled..  Was she enrolled?  In Harvard, now.  For a 6 month certificate programme (or was that a Degree?) to do with something something about leadership.  Or was she put on payroll to teach?  What can she teach with a 3 year undergrad degree in con-munications from Waikato (allegedly or apparently that is her highest level of university qualification)?  Does she get to room-share with the leader of Norway?  Party party party in the Dorms??  What the hell...</p>

                            <p>Not even trying to be fair at all.  There's nothing here.</p>

                            <p>"Hauser your stats"  is when you "clean your data" so that you change what you don't like / want into what you do.  Not willing or able to keep accurate records.  Scummy hoax of a farce of a scam.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>Did Jacinda apply to be enrolled in Harvard?  Or apply for a job there?  Are people from the US still picking out which of the natives brains they want?  They were going after the rugby players, I thought.  Richard Faull (he takes the Fall hahaha) or Professor Glue's Glue Factory.  Manufacturing LSD to give to people in the hospitals so they can better gaslight them into seeming delusional so they can be court ordered to remain indefinately in state care.  What happened to Brian Tamaki?  Last I heard the government was sooooo scared about him being a terrorist they thought to play "baby shark" at him (to soothe him, one can only suppose) and imprison him (that's how scared they were of his terrorist activities).  He was going to run for election...  So I guess he's imprisoned now, so that he can't.  There is no alternative.  We don't know how lucky we are.  Obviously.</p>
