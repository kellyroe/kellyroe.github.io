                        <div class="container">

                            <p>Here is an invoice from the University of Waikato (that was charged to my Studnet Loan):  file:///Users/kelly/Documents/GitHub/kellyroe.github.io/writing/invoice.pdf</p>

                            <p>Things to note about that invoice:</p>

                            <p>(1)  I didn't apply to do a Philosophy Thesis with the University of Waikato in 2019, at all.  I applied to 120 points 1 EFT PHIL0800 MPhil Thesis with enrolment dates 05-03-2018 - 03-03-2019.  I wrote them a thesis in 2018 and submitted it in September 2018.  October 2018.  January 2019.  February 2019.  They refused to get the thesis to externals, sent it out for the wrong qualification, refused to get the substantively updated thesis back to externals to record re-enrolment in 2019.</p>

                            <p>(2).  120 points = 0.5 EFTS for PHILO800 Philosophy MPhil Thesis 2019.  </p>

                            <p>(3).  60 points = 0.5 EFTS for PHIL0800 Philosophy MPhil Thesis 2019 5 months of enrolment. </p>

                            <p>(3). 20 points = 0.1667 EFTS for PHIL0800 Philosophy MPhil Thesis 2019 2 months of enrolment.  </p>

                            <p>What does the Tertiary Education Commission say about how Universities are required to report their Stats if they want government funding and if they want to invoice to Student Loans?  They must report them 3 ways.  120 points = 1 EFT = 34 weeks of enrolment including the examination period.  It doesn't say that 120 points = 0.5 EFTS = 60 points = being detained indefinately under the zero fees scheme.  If you scroll through to page 3 you see that they say tuition feees are owing but will be paid by the NZ Government under 'PhD examination fee waiver (domestic).  I wasn't enrolled in a PhD.  THey had no business sending my 120 point MPhil thesis out for PhD examination in 2018.  They had no business double-billing 2 lots of PhD examination (one in 2018 and then another again in 2019) when I only applied to be enrolled in a 120 point 1 EFT MPhil Degree that should have been completed in time to have enrolled in a different progamme of study (Medicine) in 2019.  I didn't need my grades to be finalised because the MPhil is ungraded the grades were from my Honors Year.  They agreed to use my grades that had already been locked in (then proceeded to refuse to accept the GPA when calculated according to their algorithm) and refused to examine my thesis for the qualification I applied to be enrolled in.</p>

                            <p>Neil Quigley (Vice Chancellor of the University of Waikato) does mathematics:</p>

                            <p>https://kellyroe.github.io/writing/squigley.pdf</p>

                            <p>External examiners are paid differently whether they are examining a Masters Thesis or a Doctoral Thesis.  I have the examiners packs that were sent to the examiners that assert this.  I don't know how much money was transferred from the University of Waikato into Caroline Mason's bank account: https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/arts/contact-us/people/carolyn-mason.html (she was one of the external examiners) to know whether she and the Canadian one were paid to examine a Doctoral or Masters thesis (twice)...  But they were provided with cover-pages for their reports that were headed 'doctoral examination'.  I mean to say whether they were paid to examine it as a masters or doctoral thesis the cover-page for their 2018 reports of the thesis made it clear that they were examinining it with respect to acceptability as a doctoral thesis.  Why?  Because no external examiner is going to say that 50,000 words is enough for a PhD.  And the Univesrity of Waikato wanted moooooooore mooooooney.</p>

                            <p>Take Quigley to China with you when you go over there with a trade delegation, Chris Hipkins.  Take him so he can be accountable for how he is billing the 'students'.  I think you will find that they are not keeping accurate records of student enrolments.  Forcing re-enrolment and more and more and more and more fees to be paid because Quigley is a f*cking psychopath.</p>

                            <p>How old is Caroline Mason ffs...  Is she over the age of 65 yet?  Time to retire Caroline.  Get the f*ck out.  Where is all your studnets research then, eh?  All the research outputs you've supervised to timely completion?  Yeah, right. </p>
