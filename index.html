                            <article>

                            <p>
                            I obtained a Summer Research Scholarship to study at the Australian National University.  As part of my obtaining this I supplied them with a writing sample of my research.  I suppose I should put that writing sample up here, since it was not published in any journal.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Professor Martin Davies seemed happy with the work that I did over the summer  but he refused to supply me with a reference for PhD applications.  He said he would put in a good word for me with the Australian National University but that was all.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I was offered an Australian Government Post-Graduate Student Award to study my PhD at the Australian National University (also Macquarie and Queensland after I had applied to them).  I chose the Australian National University because of their on campus accommodation and because of my previous experience working well in the environment.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I have documented work that I did at the Australian National University on the Seminars and Writing page.  I gave 4 seminars in my first year (the seminar presentations were derived from written essays).  One of those was my 6 monthly review.  I gave 4 seminars in my second year (Sterelny told me he didn't want me reading written essays so I only have powerpoints to show for those).  One of those should have been my mid-term since the PhD is 3 years extendible to 4.  But Sterelny wouldn't let me schedule one.  I was making satisfactory enough progress on my PhD to be granted a Vice Chancellor's travel scholarship to the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, however. I gave a seminar over there.  Then I gave a seminar to the ANU after my return which Sterelny still refused to allow to be a mid-term.  In 2012 I had a 100,000 word ++++ monstrosity.  Because I wasn't being progressed through my PhD in a timely fashion so my little hoop to jump through before they pay me was turning into my lifes slave-labor. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Awwwwwwwwww.  She just didn't make it.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Compare, then.  Compare the work I did in my first year to the work other students did in their first year for all their first year credit.  Compare the second year research output.  Other studnets progressed through their Degrees and got their qualifications.  Look at how Sterelny chooses to talk to me: <a href="judicial-review/kim.pdf" target="_self"> Words of Wisdom </a>.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I was advised by the University of Auckland that they wouldn't acknowledge a PhD from the Australian National University and they also wouldn't acknowledge my previously completed MA from the University of Waikato because it was more than 3 years old.  This is for the purpose of entry to MBChB (Medicine).  I saw that the University of Waikato offered a 120 point MPhil Degree and asked Auckland if completing that would mean they would consider me for Medicine.  They said they would and that I needed to complete the qualification in the 'minimum, normal, or standard time'.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I have documented on the writing tab how the University of Waikato refused to enrol me in the programme I applied to when I had applied by the application deadline.  They enrolled me in a differently coded program of study with later start date in order to try and force the program to run across two different academic years.  They subsequently refused to get theses that I submitted for examination out to external examiners to prevent and prohibit them from signing off that I completed the requirements of the Degree.  They then sent the thesis off to be examined for the wrong qualification (PhD rather than Masters so the 50,000 word Masters would come up too short for a 100,000 word PhD document).  They refused to get work I had substantively updated in response to externals  back to externals to prevent them signing me off.  They gave my thesis softcopies away to the externals and when externals kept them (signifying acceptance) they refused to allow me to substitute hardcopy in the library in fulfilment of regulations for the Degree.  They re-enrolled me so as to collect up more fees from the Government for having me re-enrolled.  They directed me to change the thesis in ways quite different from what the external examiners requested of me.  The New Zealand examiner then said they accepted the University had failed me.  The overseas examiner then said they wanted an oral examination (so as to see why the University was failing me) and they refused to schedule an oral examination instead updating my transcript to record that I failed to meet their standard.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The Judiciary pulled Justice Toogood out of retirement (and paid him, I suppose) rather than appointing a new Judge if they need more Judges.  He made false assertions of fact (e.g., he asserted I tried to complete the thesis 'too early' but this is false Tertiary Education Commission says that 120 points of study = 1 EFT = 34 weeks 'notional learning period' where 'notional learning period' included 'examination period').  They also define 1 year as being a maximum of 12 calendar months.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Justice Mander was also pulled out of retirement (rather than hiring a new Judge) to judge that he could not see a problem with the University of Otago refusing to supply applications to people who are eligible to be enrolled. He also did not see a problem with the University of Otago throwing away applications so as to prevent them getting before the Medical Admissions Committee so as to prevent the Medical Admissions Committee selecting certian candidates.  He couldn't see a problem with them collecting up information about things like race and disability prior to deciding which applications to throw away without having considered the application on it's merits.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Here are my submissions to the Court of Appeal regarding the University of Otago:

                                <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>.  I post them here because the Courts say I am out of time because I did not pay them $7,060 by the deadline they set.  I post them here so you can judge for yourself whether the courts have or have not upheld justice by pulling Jusitce Mander out of retirement to have him deliver this decision.  If Justice Mander was found to be inadequate or incompetent as a Judge then what is the consequence?  He goes back into retirement? 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I have not tried to make my filings look like the filings of a QC or a firm because they do not pay me to do filings.  The Judges have refused to appoint an amicus and have also refused to help me be supplied with a legal aid lawyer when I could not find any willing to help me when I have asked for assistance of more than 20 who were listed as legal aid lawyers.  I have requested Meredith Connell initiate prosecution and requested the Solicitor General and Attorney General initiate prosecution and everybody declines to do so.  The Ombudsman doesn't see anything problematic, either.  The Privacy Commissioner, the Health and Disability Commissioner, the Human Rights people...  Meredith Connell claimed to be conflicted out of prosecuting anything to do with Health or anything to do with any employee of the Auckland District Health Board.  They have their template responses of how they aren't going to do anything at all.
                                </p>

                                <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings on grounds that it had already passed judgment on the filings and would not revisit the issue.  They did not think my filings sufficient to show there had been a grotesque injustice.  I post them so you can judge for yourself.  
                                </p> 

                                <p>
                                 New Zealand is a State of Australia (it is written into the Australian Constitution): <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  They do not progress my submissions.
                                </p>  

                                <p>
                                The Universities of Otago and Auckland are not being fair as to how they are choosing what students to enrol in Medicine.  It wasn't that Dr Leeks happened to slip through a selection criterion or process objectively and fairly applied.  It was that he was hand-picked or specially chosen for demonstrating all the qualities they value.  I suppose, then, he was transferred to Melborne because that is also what they value over there.  I don't see what else we are supposed to think about that when they harbor him they way they have chosen to.  He doesn't get to be too sick to stand trial.  He is not worthy of consideration that he refused to show his victims.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The Universities and courts have broken the social contract.  The Courts have chosen to set precedent that it will cost upwards of $20,000 to take a case against the Univesrity to the High COurt and the High Court will not uphold Justice.  
                                </p>

                                <p>New Zealand keeps detention / slave camps.  New Zealand is a state of Australia.  Australia chooses to supply New Zealand Dollars to New Zealanders to prevent them travelling domestically and to disguise how low the wages are kept in New Zealand.  They will not pay the teachers, police, nurses, etc.  They do not value the lives of New Zealanders.  They keep slave / dention camps.  They do not allow qualification progression and completion.  They are not fair in their allocation of training places.  They are not fair in their process of advertising (if they even do) or appointing people for paid jobs.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                New Zealand sometimes cons and swindles making false promises.  Then arranging for people to be involuntarily detained (before or after having been raped) and deported with no pay. If not outright suicided or murdered.  Simply vanish when it's time for you to be paid.  New Zealand also intentionally aims to attract people who believe they have no other option.  People who don't get to immigrate to the USA or Australia or Canada or the UK.  They intentionally want those people because they think that these people are particularly susceptible to the brain-washing about them being of little to no value.  New Zealand likes to treat them as slaves and thinks it can profiteer considerably from their low self esteem.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The reason why I wanted to go to the USA instead of hurring through my PhD from Honors in New Zealand is because I wanted to learn more.  And New Zealand won't employ the skilled and knowledgable people in the Universities here.  It is the hiring decisions that they choose to make.  Again, they have our people employed believing they are only employed here because they would not be employed anywhere else.  They won't make it possible or attractive for people to come here for sabattical for a time, even, so our students can learn in that way.  We won't develop graduate level curriculum.  We won't actually listen to the reasons why people want to go and start developing and offering those things here.  Instead, we have chosen to really take the low road and force people to stay.  If people won't choose to stay here and be abused then we will keep them as slaves properly, then.  The real low road.  
                                </p>
                        

                                <p> I put in an application to do another PhD with the ANU last year to see what would happen with it.  When I applied I said I was not really interested in starting over, and was more interested in recieving credit for the work I had done for them already.  I said I wanted to study Medicine.  Only I wasn't sure if there was any Medicine because there isn't any respect, at all, for informed consent.  So, there aren't 'cervical examinations' there are 'sexual assaults' and there aren't 'surgeries' there are 'physical assaults' and so on.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I find myself thinking 'there is no excuse for threats of violence'.  But I also find myself wondering what options there are for students or employees or slaves or volunteers when people who have kept them working or studying do not honor terms and when the courts refuse to uphold the law.  It might be possible to escape.  1/4 of the population of New Zealand has fled.  I find myself thinking 'it's the brain drain' and I find myself thinking about the brain drain 'if you have any brains then you will flee far away from here'.  And I find myself then thinking about flocks of migrants who are treated horribly everywhere they go.  False promises of a better life and then being kept as second or third class citizens.  And I wonder why it is that those who are wronged should be forced to flee and why it is that those who are doing the wrongs should  be allowed to persist in their wrongs.  
                               </p>

                               <p>
                                The Education and Training Act 2020 and the Education Acts prior to that all stated that domestic adults who had attained the age of 20 years were eligible to  be enrolled in the programme they applied to.  They stated that teenagers (under the age of 20 years) were able to be enrolled by the University only if the University was satisfied that they were able to complete the course.  So, when we hear of a Univerity being satisfied enough that a teenager could complete the course so as to enrol them and take their money and we then hear of the University failing them for their course not only once, but two years in a row, then it really looks like the University has some explaining to do as to how it was that they could not pass the student.
                               </p>

                               <p>
                                The High Court of Dunedin did not see it that way because the Judges are themselves involved in this process of bullying and abusing those who have  been wronged.  They think their job is to help the powerful be more powerful.  They don't appear to have a sense or conception of justice, at all.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The University of Otago is not processing applications to enrol properly.  They are not grading properly, either.  The reason why Universities do not give students back their work alongside grading schedules is to hide and conceal the evidence of them grading students work differently from teh grading schedules.  Published class lists make up studnets and information (e.g., saying that a certain number of students in the class were given A+ grades when that is not possible on that assignment without cheating).  They ask impossible questions in multiple-choice sometiems where the only way you could get that correct is by luck or by someone having given you the arbitrary answer in advance. They do this so as to give hardworking and motivated students poor grades.  It is part of the bullying and abuse that they do to have studnets feel inferior.  It is not an education system or a training program in anything other than having students settle for low to no paid work.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                When there is no justice then what are you supposed to do?  You could flee...  But why should you flee?  What is this?  The Ukrane?  That is...  Unfortunate terrain.  Given it's central location and the presence of nuclear storage facility.  I don't see similar pressures on getting people to leave New Zealand.  I don't know if there are indigenous people of Ukrane who are being displaced.  But this is the homeland of Maaori and they are recognised as an indigenous population internationally.  People shouldn't be forced to flee New Zealanders because of all these people who have been paid for their working lives already who refuse to share the wealth around, who refuse to train a new workforce, and who refuse to stand down.  When they refuse to listen to or progress complaints.  When they insist on treating people unfairly.  When the judiciary fails to uphold justice.  When people get sick and tired of running away (or when Covid restrictions prevent people from fleeing so that people are required to stand up for themselves back home) then what do people have to do for things to change?  They seem determined to force acts of terrorism.  They refuse to listen to the people. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The University of Auckland is required to apply the algorithm they published for the purposes of selection and enrol me if and only if my rank order score is high enough for enrolment.  If they don't do this then it would be better for the Universities of New Zealand to be shut down.  We don't have Universities.  We have slave / detention camps only.  The Australian National Univesrity, too, does not seem to be making enrolment decisions on the basis of merit.  My 2021 application for PhD was declined.  Apparently I haven't done enough high quality work to even START a PhD.  Compare all my written work with the written work supplied by the students they chose to enrol to start their PhD this year.  I had a publication with Oxford Univesrity Press but apparently that isn't good enough for them.  Decide for yourself the quality and integrity of a 'University System' who refuses to process or progress students on the basis of academic merit and where, more particularly, the people paid to teach and train speak to their students the way that Sterelny choses to speak to me.  People are waiting for him to die so that a few more people can have jobs.  He did not do his job supervising me.  What do they pay him for?
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                There is a conversation that I remember.  It was some time ago, and I may remember it a bit wrongly.  I think that Sterelny said that Australian PhD students had things a bit better than New Zealand PhD students because New Zealand has the incentive structure all wrong.  Australian Universities got money from the Government for completed PhD's.  So there was an incentive for the department to get students work out to externals when they thought it would be passed and they were pleased to get the thesis finished up.  Or maybe that was his aspirational goal.  And that wasn't really how things were in Australia.  Maybe that was an idea that he was putting out there, as to what it would take for a department to be happy and pleased and proud to see their students actually completing their PhD.  He said that New Zealand Universities got money for enrolment.  The joke was 'keeping the bums on the seats'.  It was a bit of a joke because that's how the Ministry or whoever decides the incentive structure viewed or treated students. As bums.  To be kept paying the University paying the University and where the Government would pay the University as well in order to keep the bums on the seats.

                                <p>It does cost money to train people.  But training schemes are scummy scams when you pay them and they put you to work and they don't pay you for the work that you do -- rather they pay you and instead of training you they put you to work.  What taught courses did I get to do while I was working on my PhD?  The USA gave me some.  That was why I wanted to go there by preference.  I wanted 2 years more courses.  Where knowledgable people are paid to teach me what knowledge they have.  Where I learn what they know.  Instead of simply being put to work.

                                Apparently Hipkins (or the Ministry he is spokes-person for) isn't content with them having ruined the University System, they are setting about to ruin the trades sysem as well.  Previously we relied on migrant workers to slave for less than minimum wage on construction jobs.  Now the borders are closed.  Nations are preventing us from keeping slaves.  So we need to get domestic workers to work those jobs.  Instead of paying the workers to work those jobs we will pay construction companies $1,000 per week to have a first year student and $500 per week to have a second year student.  So we create an incentive structure for them to fail first year studnets to make them repeate the first year.  Do that until we have used up their 'lifetime entitltement to education' we call it.  That's a very very low road to growth, indeed.  Training costs money, you say?  Well lets see an account of where they are spending the $1,000 they get for every student.  What teachers are they hiring to teach them?  What is their curriculum?  What skills are signed off as being skills they can do independently?

                                It isn't a training system or an apprenticeship system unless it is actually training them.  And then actually signing them off.  Why would they sign off the apprentice when they can collect up more and more and more money from the government and the student both for refusing to sign off on completion of the qualification?  New Zealand does not have a training system.  It won't give out the qualifications once people have done the training.  They say we can't give them qualifications because they don't know anything.  If that is true it is only because they refused to teach them anything.  They are holding hostages only.

                                They can't hire people to teach them, apparently.   Because we don't have any knowledgeable people, in New Zealand.  Certain people are paid big money, big money, indeed, to keep hostages / run slaves.  That is New Zealand.  The slave labor detention camp of Australia.

                                I don't know what has happened to Australia in more recent years.  I think it seems to have gone the same way as New Zealand.  I guess it used New Zealand as a pilot study or a test case or something like that.  Then it decided to take some of the offenders or people who were willing to take more than their share to engage in or participate in such a system and it imported them from New Zealand to Australia.  So, Harlene Hayes.  Western Australia is promising to take students their first year out of Secondary School and train them to do Medicine.  I suppose it's the Otago alumni with money who previously paid Otago money to expediate the selection of their teenagers.  They will get Australian Dollars out of them for expediating their teenagers, now.  I don't know if that means Otago is freer than it was from that old-money entltled however many generations off the first ship sort of investment...  Then those kids can be put to work performing wrongful deaths and so on on the miners and aboriginal populations.  Just brilliant.

                                I don't know what it is with Sterelny saying his former students (the New Zealand ones) often don't get jobs.  I don't know why he would bother to even graduate his New Zealand students given that New Zealand wont' give them jobs.  On the other hand, I made it clear I didn't want a job in philosophy (other people do -- so that's good, right?  Given that there aren't enoguh jobs in Philosophy for everyone who wants one it's good that someone realises they don't want one and moves aside for other people -- right)?  So then if I don't want a job in Philsophy I must  be forced to do the work as slave.  Right?  I must be forced to do the law work as slave?  There is no precedent in New Zealand for self represented litigants to be awarded costs.  Certainly not awarded anything for their labor.

                                The New Zealand Government has chosen to create and impose incentive structures incentivising slavery.  Preventing and prohibiting the developoment of training systems and skilled labor.

                                I do feel that New Zealand is punishing me.  I completed my BA and Hons and I could have applied to Medicine at that point.  Or I could have applied to do a PhD in New Zealand at that point.  I said I wanted to go to the USA.  Why?  Because I wanted to learn more.  Doing a PhD was being put to work writing a thesis.  I wanted to do more classes and learn more.  I also didn't feel ready to do Medicine.  If I was selected for that I didn't have the science background of other students.  Instead of New Zealand offering me enrolment in courses during my PhD (even letting me study part time at under-grad level) and doing my Phd...  Or doing a student exhange to USA for 1 year for some course-work...  They didn't offer me anything.  They didn't ask me why I wanted to leave.  They just got butt-hurt about it and got busy figuring how to ensure that people didn't have options anymore by stabotaging under-graduate grades.  Now that I know I'm capable of studying Medical Curriculum (after working independently on USMLE study material) they are determined I do not get to be enrolled in that program.  We can see it isn't about developing a skilled workforce at all.  It is about the keeping of slaves.  They choose to pull Judges out of retirement and pay them.  Not because they are competent, often becuase they are not.  They choose to pay them rather than appointing new judges so that there are jobs for other people in New Zealand.  They just won't do it.

                                I wonder how many hostages Harvard has this year.  Harvard and MIT.  How many New Zealand people were sent to them who they are supposed to graduate.  Why would they graduate them?  Why wouldn't they demand that Jacinda pay them 2x the fees that were cited otherwise they will simply fail the students?  We are talking about the children of the people who paid Crimson Education etc to ensure their children bribed their way into priority entrance at US schools.  How much additional money are they now required to pay to the US Universities for their 2 year Masters in Public Health or 2 year Masters in Law, or whatever.  The Children of the public officials in New Zealand who sent their children overseas for a Private School Education with their salaries that are, effectively, tax-payers dime.  Why would Harvard treat New Zealand studnets any better than New Zealand treats it's own studnets?  Why would Harvard treat New Zealand students any better than New Zealand treats it's on international students?  Would you like to do business with New Zealand?
