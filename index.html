    <p>'One of the issues which has been identified by the network is that the NCEA results in rural areas are limiting the pool of prospective students'.  https://www.odt.co.nz/opinion/editorial/rural-gp-training-proposal-welcome 
    </p>

    <p> They are throwing away applications, and then crying about how they don't have enough applications.  Well break out another season of 'Shortland Street'!  The Education and Training Act states that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible to be enrolled in the programme they have applied for.  But they throw their applications away because they want wide eyed teenagers who will do anything anything anything before tossing them away.
    </p>

    <p>
    They are refusing to train a new generation of GPs because new GPs will get a job only over the dead bodies of the old GPs and the old GPs have no intention of dying for the next 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 or 100 years and so they have no intention of training new GPs.  I mean, why would anybody voluntariliy choose to give up their payroll?  It doesn't make any sense.  And why would they sign off on completion of training from someone who might be paid instead of them.  WHy would they set themselves up for potentially having less money.  It doesn't make any sense.
    </p>

    <p>Rinse and repeat for everything else.  We don't have any teachers, nurses, lawyers, judges, police, plumbers, electricians.  It's soooooo competitive.  Nobody applies to do those things.  Nobody graduates from those qualifications.  Nobody applies for those jobs.   Nobody is on payroll to work those jobs.  Just a  bunch of 60 or 70 or 80 year olds on 3x or 4x the payroll while they take the 'work' outputs of the younger ones (who pay the university who pay the university who pay the university who pay who pay who pay for their 'training')...  All the ones kept on government welfare (less than minimum wage)...  Take all the 'work' outputs until the day that they die.  Apparently it's sooooooooo competitive.  There will be a job for me only over however many dead bodies.  Waiting waiting waiting for the bodies to die.  Allllll the payroll for them.  ALlllll the payroll for them.  ALlllll the payroll for them.  Allll of the payroll for them.</p> 

    <p>The courts have ruled that the universities don't have to examine studnets work.  They don't have to get their work to externals.  They don't have to give students qualifiations when they have done the work for them.  The secondary schools don't have to either.  I mean, it doesn't matter how well you score in your NCEA examinations if your teachers want to collect up more and more and more money for keeping you enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled then they don't have to pass you.  Why would they pass you?  Why wouldn't they pass all and only the ones who cannot function independently.  That's a great idea.  That way they can be sure that they are the only ones on payroll.  All of the payroll for them.  All of the payroll for them.  But what payroll?  Australian Payroll no work for New Zealand teachers.  Australian Payroll  no work.  Keeping of slaves...  The Univesrities are blatently functioning as slave prison or detention camps.  They aren't employing people willing and able to do research.  They are intentionally employing people who are unwilling and or unable to do research.  They knowingly put people on payroll with the intent that they will refuse to graduate students so as to keep slaves hostages prisoners.  There's nothing in Australasia.  Unless you want to be a slaver.  Prison guard.  Keeper of hostages.  Micro-manage other people's work me-wards only for allll of the payroll nd alll of the credit for you.  That's how come they can re-deploy people so easily..  There is no difference.  It's all the same.  The keeping of hostages and slaves.  Train in one thing and get less payroll for doing something different entirely.  Qualifications not acknowledged anymore . Only given in the first place because they never would be.  ALl of the honorary degrees only that don't mean anything at all.  There's nothing to see...  It doesn't matter what the laws are because the courts refuse to uphold the laws.  THey won't write fair examination scripts or even if they do they won't fairly examine the work tkhat has been done.  They won't blind grade work on it's academic merits.  ALl the energy and effort and time and expense that goes into the keeping of slaves.  The lowest value economy in the world.  By design.  The leaders seem determined to keep it so.  The courts seem to think their job or role is to compound injustices only.  There's nothing here.</p>

    <p>How many old people do we want in rural communities?  Well, then.  Just put a bunch of murdering pedophile psychopaths out there as community leaders and let them gnaw each other to death.  Problem solved.  Then we can declare theis land terra nullus and everywhere else lin teh world can send their undesirables here.  Teh arse end of nowhere.  Nothing here.  All of the medical experiments can be done on the peple down here.  It's sooooooo competitive.  Soooooooo competitive.  Sooooooo competitive.  How many FTE's was Ailsa Claire, again?  MOre than half  million to do what?  To keep hostages and cry cry cry cry cry to the government for more money.  How many FTE's was the VC of the University of Auclkand?  More than half a million to do what?  To keep hostages and cry cry cry cry cry to the government for more money.   How many FTE's was Una Jagose again?  NOtice a common theme here?  HOw many people 'don't count' for the purposes of rates of unemployment?  How many people are actully paid to work full time jobs in New Zealand?  There is really nothing here...  I guess they will be paying people in bitcoin soon.  Because states aren't allowed to print their own money / mint their own coin.  But, of course, the NZ dollar is ordered to be printed by Australia, I belive.  To disguise and conceal that they don't pay New Zealanders Australian wages.  Keeping people gnawing each other to death over scraps.  Wasteland.  Indeed.  But the worst of it is the energy and effort nd time nd expense that goes into ensuring that  this is so and this is how it must remain.  No hint of 'try'.  No good deed goes unpunished in these lands.</p>

    <p>The courts are still refusing to pay compensation to the victims of Dr Leeks.  Meanwhile they are deliberating on whether another child should be given to other Medical 'Professionals' to do whatever they want with for a weekend (open heart surgery with blood units and plasma from Australia) before he is given back to his parents.  That's convenient.  The courts and the government can simply mandate that people are required to follow orders or instructions in these parts.  There is already no opt off from record sharing systems.  That way they can get teh important research data out, you see.  From all the medical experiments that are being done on people in these parts.  That's presumably how come we only 'treat' the involuntary.  Non-voluntary.  Non-consenting.  There's nothing here.  They won't train a workforce.  But they also won't get out of the way when people do learn how to do things in spite of and despite of them.  NOt because of them because why would someone voluntarily choose to walk away from however much money.  There's nothing in these parts.  Party party party lets have a party lets muster up the biggest mob to take to take to take.  There's nothing here.</p>

    <p>People know Kim Sterelny. They know what kind of person he is.  The world is very hostile and it's sooooooo competitive.  All the thinking is driven by people trying to gnaw each other's arms off.  It's soooooo surprising that there is anything anything anything at all.  These are the stories they looooove to here.  Allll of the research funding for him and the hostile world that he is building that makes them feel like they are such successes at and in life.  It's all soooooooo competitive.  People know what he's like inter-personally.  'You f*cked the dog' and 'f*cking c*nt' and so on and so forth.  But he's jokey jokey and so it's okay.  Most highly esteemed on payroll.  All of the payroll for him.  Alll of the payroll for him.  ALlll of the payroll for him.  Or, let's see...  Professor Martin Davies.  He got a couple  hundred thousand dollars ARC grant to work on delusions.  I got paid to do a summer scholarship and give a department talk.  I did the work I was paid to do over the summer.  Martin Davies then refuses to write me a reference. Who the f*ck doesn't write someone a reference saying that they did the job they were contracted when they did the f*cking job they were contracted?  What the hell kind of person does that?  I guess you probably need to take a look at people in the Northern Hemisphere (around Oxford) and the work that I did on the topic of delusions and see who got credited for my work.  Since my work isn't credited for me or to me at all.  Allll of the payroll for him.  Allll of the payroll for him.  Is he f*cking dead yet?  Sterelny would say.  Is he f*cking dead yet?  Or how about Dave Chalmers.  Let's see..  The Zombie Army of New York.  I suppose it did in deed come to be.  All these young adults..  Right bout when it was time to pay them.  Time to sign off on their qualification completion.  Time to sign off on completion of their training.  They all up and died of Covid.  Depopulated the city  a bit so there was room for old retired people people to move into the city.  And they wouldn't have to worry about paying the old retired people. Except of course they likely aren't retired at all.  All of the payroll for them.  ALl of the payroll for them.  Let's send generations of people off to die because it's soooooo cmopetitive.  Once people have 3x or 4x or 9x the payroll that's how many people need to die for them?  It's soooooo competitive.  It's sooooo cmopetitive.  Are they f*cking dead yet?  How about today?  Did they die today?  Can I has payroll now?  You could just hand me your work and your payroll too.  Right?  Just hand it oer and go curl up and die now, there's a good boy.  Alllllll of the payroll for you.  Your grand plan, there of nasty brutish and short tragedy of commons race to the bottom psychopath land overtaken by taken over by psychopaths.  All of the everything for you.  ALll of the everything for you.   You you you and your f*cking selfishh.  Just f*cking take everything.  There's nothing here.  No universities at all.  No helthcare.  No judiciary.  No speak English.  Cant' parse the constitution.  Does not matter what any of the laws are  becuase they refuse to uphold them.  No point passing new ones or anything.  No point hearing the cases because they can't / won't uphold the laws.  They pretend to be too stupid to read them.  There' snothing here. .  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  Wah wah wah mooooooore money.  There aren't any people.  March them off to die..   Breed more breed more breed more.  Then put them on ventillators and remove them when it's time to graduate them or time to put them on payroll.  Nothing here.  Nobody home. </p>

    <p>They won't fund social services.  And nobody wants 'social services'.   Not voluntarily.  Who voluntarily chooses to go off to a 'social service' school to be abused by pedophiles?  But they insist on screening and selecting and choosing pedophiles to put them on payroll as teachers.  To trade them around.  Most highly valued employees, apparently. They would only employ pedophiles if only they could find enough pedophiles to entirely populate the whole teaching profession with them.  But they are so very very very in demand, they want them for Medicien, too.  Dr Leeks most highly valued esteemed member of the profession who needed to be re-deployed to continue on his crimes in Melbourne after he'd rolled out is social service programme for New Zealand.  So, then, who voluntarily chooses to do education in NZ.  To have healthcare in NZ.  I mean, there's nothing there.  What do you have to do to reduce demand for social services.  The government takes all of the tax money (for trafficking mostly children for sex offenses, one can only suppose) and takes all of the payroll all of the payroll all of the payroll and shares it around with the money makers..  ANd everyone else can curl up and die.  Once they've takekn everything from them...  They can, what did the courts say 'burn themselves out'.  That's what people do.  They voluntrily choose to hnd over all fo their work nd all of their payroll to the pedophiles and psychopaths.  Riiiiight.  That's how we ensure we have the lowest valued people in the world for everyone else to do experiments on etc.  Real destination for all the psychopaths in the world.  The leaders can't even parse the constitution.  I guess that was why they were carefully hand-picked to lead.  I mean, it can't be that hard to find someone who lacks the cpacity to process an application and pay them half a million dollars per year to not process applications.  There aren't any people in NZ, apparently.   Nobody applied.  See, they designed the forms such that when you hit 'submit' the form jams so that they could say nobody applied.  They put a 'you failed to pass the test to establish that you are not a robot' declaration on the form for when you lodge a complint with the human rights people.  I mean to say the people on payroll designed a system to tell people that they failed the test to establish that they were a person when they try and lodge a complaint bout human rights violation.  There is nothing in these lnds.  It is a garbage land of nothing.  I understand various people pat themselves on teh back all self-congradulatory that htey made it in life.  HOw many slaves do they keep?  That's the measure or the mark of success in these lands.  Right?  How many people were murdered or how many hostages are there such that they can smugly congradulate themselves on everything it is that they are and everything it is that they have.  All the work they do to undermine and stabotage and prevent and prohibit and obstruct and lie and cheat and swindle and...  That's the only game in town.  Right?  Psychopath land.  Puts out a beacon to the world begging to be put out of it's misery.  Nobody wnted things to be any different.  They didnt' get any applications or any applicants who wanting anything to be different.  Just a  bunch people tucking in behind there then trying to prove their worth with how many heads they got.  There's nothing here.</p>

    <p>Several people lodged several complaints about Malachi.  They didn't just 'suspect' that he was being abused, they were pretty sure that he was being.  They were sure enough about it for several people to lodge several complaints.  And the complaints were ignored until he died.  The point is that you don't need to mandate people complaining.  People did complain.  They say 'thanks for complaining we now mark your name as a complainer no payroll for you' and work to ensure that the fears of the complainants are realised.  That is what you get for complaining.  See?  See?  See?  Now the courts are going to work to take custody of anyone who does not comply with 'Medical Directive' (shall we say).  Even when the 'Medical Directive' is unlawful (right Ashley?).  What a f*cking farce of a farce-land.  Meanwhile...  Where is credit for my Degree?  Where is my offer of enrolment in MBChB?  What a f*cking joke...  We don't have any Doctors.  Wah wah wah wah wah.  Nobody applied for that position.  We threw all the applicants for that away.  Put a bunch of teenagers to work and threw them in prison (or worse) when it was time to pay them if we couldnt' convince them to 'burn themselves out' all voluntary-like.  Dr Leeks is the only game in town.  The only one who gets to be on payroll.  What a f*cking farce of a joke-land.  There's nothing here.  Nobody home.</p>

    <p>Chris Whelan should really be put to work campaigning for people with intellectual handicap to be paid.  I mean to say, his statutory function is clear, in law.  To uphold the quality and integrity of NZ University qualifications and to ensure we are fulfilling our obligations to protect whistle-blowers, according to international law.  In response to this (his job description) he gets the complaints -- and he throws them away.  He says that the compliaints are not really complaints.  They are ikdhierkhjgjf and not complaints.  So he doesn't need to do anything with them, at all.  He says that students aren't employees so NZ has no interntional obligations to do anything about them at all.  He says that the quality of NZ Universities is such that they couldnt' be or go any lower and so since they would  be better than they are if he were to actually process a complaint his duty is to ensure that the complaints are not processed.  Sorry, they aren't complaints.  They are klerjiorkjghdfjgf.  I don't know how quickly he could screw a lid on a jar...  But I see how quicklky he can take a complaint that was emailed to the address that you send complaints to and...  Forward that to the police.  Which is what his policy tht he wrote for himself to follow says that he should do.  It gets the complaint (in the complaint email) and it hits 'forward' to the police's address.  He is supposed to collect up evidnece sot hat the police can't say 'we don't have enough money to get a police officer to investigate white collar stuff Wah wah wah pay us more money or we won't investigate'.  It is his job desccription in statute to collect up the evidnece tht is relevant and forward tht to police.  So, then, wehre is the evidnece tht Chris Whelan has the willingness or ability to do his job?  I mean...  50 cents an hour for him to not get a single complaint to the police?  Perhps we should pay him by the number of complints he recieves tht he then gets to police with evidnce...  But then his payroll would be 0.  Because that's the work that he did.  0 work.  so.  To be clear...  They pay him excess of quarter of a million dollars per year in order to ensure that the statutory function of his job (the Chief Executive of the New Zealand Vice Chancellor's Committee) is not fulfilled by him.  Is not fulfilled by anyone.  NOw...  Is it stupidity?  It is incapacity?  What kind of incapacity could there be?  To not  be able to set up automated 'please get me the evidnce that will be forwarded with your complint' and then forward the complaint and evidenc to the police.  He says that emails to the 'complaint' email are not complaints.  Malicoiusness.  Malevolence.  They pay him to ensure that his statutory function is not performed.  Not by him . NOt by anyone.  The reason they pay him so much (quarter of a millino per year)  is because it was only supposed to be temporary.  I mean to say, they know it is only a matter of time before the game is up.  The jig is up.  Someone points out the f*cking obvious:  He isnt' willing or able to work that job.  At which point he needs to go away.  They will have to redeploy him to, I don't know, go be Vice Chancellor of the Univesrity of Queensland.  To throw away applications and completions and to hand over the intellectual property to the northern hemisphere for various people over there to take credit for it.  One can only suppose.  F*cking psychopths of the waste-land.  The courts get a judge out of retirement (waas it?) One not appointed by proper process to not see anyting wrong with the inability or unwillingness of him to do his job..  ANd the junior law person was sent back to Univesrity for a ...  20  year masters degree.  Was it?</p>

    <p>I mean, it isn't like Waikato has any research outputs.  I mean, there isn't a journal, or anything.  It isn't like Australiasia has any research outputs.  Everything is hidden behind a paywall.  Look at the things they choose to fund.  The world ils hostile and I'm a selfish f*ck.  Yay you.  We can go around labelling people stupid or whatever and bullying them into handinf all the work over to us so we can take credit for all of their work all of their work attribted to us and all of the payroll for us.  They can pult the stupid in bred intellectually handicapped children of the administration in the high value half a million dollar jobs per year.  Wear a fancy suit to take the complaints and throw them in the bin.  I suspect you can find various people currently kept on less than 50 cents per hour who can do a better job of hitting 'forward' on an email (especially given that it wouldnt' be that hard to set up an autor-forward before employing them so, effectively, they don't need to do anything at all except keep out of the f*cking way of the autormated - it comes into the email inbox and goes out of hte emamil outbox to police' processing by the New Zealnd Vice Chancellors Committee.  Most highly esteemed government executive department.  F*cking psychopaths.  What Universities?  What training system? All of the f*cking money for Chris Whelan.  Send his right royal smarminess around the f*cking world blackbirding for underage teenager slaves. F*cking psychopath.</p>

    <p>Apparently it's not systemic.  It's personal.  It's all very very very partiuclar and very very personal against me.  That's what makes it okay, in the eyes or mind or hearts of the courts.  That they declare it to all be very very very very particular and very very very very personal against or about me.  Not a matter of public interest to New Zealand or Internatinal Community at all.  I must pay the costs, I must pay the costs, I must pay the costs of Chris Whelan's inability or unwillingness to take tkhe complaints and forward them to the police along with evidence of what the claimant is saying is wrong.  Apparently, also, how the Univesrities have been treating me is not any different from hwo they are treating most everybody else.  So it's personal enough against me to not be a matter of public interest (therefore I must pay) but it's also not that they are treating me any differently from anybody else (which is apparently what makes how they are treating me okay).  Garbage garbage garbage garbage garbage output from the courts.  I have filed everything that needs to be filed for hte court of appeal.  Filed it close to a year ago, now.  THey say they will keep granting me extesion after extension after extension while they wait for me to pay the ocurts pay teh courts pay the courts pay the courts.  I should pay the courts for the crimes of the Universities so the Universities can take the money and give the VC's payrises.  All the payrises for the administration.  They ned to get the money out quicklky quickly quickly quickly they seem to have decided that the gig is only temporary, you see.  They need to quickly quickly quickly get the money out since people are starting to catch on that there' snothing here.  NObody would voluntarily choose to 'enrol' in a programme of study that is slavery.  That's all it is.  There's nothing there.  But Waikato has established precedent that they can claim that students are enrolled in various things (even invoicing loans to the studnets name with the IRD) when the studnet never aven applied to that programem or course of study.  THey are telling lies and fibs to the government about who are students and about what their programmes of study are.  Tehy are keeping false transcripts and false records.  There aren't any universities here.  Nothing.  Nothing nothing at all.  They won't allow there to be.  They can't  / won't even process an applicatin.  Ffs.  There's nothing there.</p>

    <p>Covid was political.  Curing the common cold has long been on the bucket list for science.  To see if they could.  HIV was an interesting target because they infected enough people with it to cry cry cry cry cry that they needed more and more and more money for researching it.  ANd they learned a lot by finding people who (despite their very very best efforts) did not become sick with the virus even though they had been exposed to heavy doses that would have long previously killed most everybody else.  THey find the immunologiclly elite in this manner or way then sign then up all voluntary like to take one for the team of everybody else and take and take and take from them to discover what it is about them tht solved the problem.  Anyway, HIV was an interesting target because it evolves defences in real time so they can make a case for more constant monitoring and adjustment to treatment.  Not a one dose does it.  An ongoing reigime.  Ongoing dependency.  Anyway, Respiratory Syncytical VIrus was something that there were apparent epidemics of, in children, every year.  Before Covid.  Then when there was Covid there wasn't much of that.  Apparently  because the kids were staying home.  But they weren't..  They were still going to child care and school.  Mostly.  I had thought.  Anyway..  Apparently Respiratoary Syncytical Virus is a different virus.  Only I don't know that it is.  If they sequence the virus that is causing the syncytium it will turn out to be Covid, I suppose.  See, syncytium is just something that can be observed in the tissue of the lungs.  It is something that viruses do.  What is more interesting is what virus in partiuclar is causing it.  Since we don't believe in Covid in children, I mean to say.  I suspect that it simply is Covid in children.  They did not want to shut down the early childhood and schools and so on.  Not really.  Socially engineering whether it is was better for the government to take the kids for however many hours of every day or whether the parents would do a better job of bullying nd abusing them at home.  One can only suppose.  So that, you know, the children of the administration can be the only game in town.  But only of the administration feel kindly about their children.  No idea why they would when they could simply keep everything to and for themselves and murder their children.  Right Sterelny?  I guess they better devote themselves to the task of..  What was that?  Making you not want ot kill them.  Riiiiight.  </p>

    <p>Somesomething something about the USA giving a cash injection to NZ for NZ media content.  It isn't throwing the cat amongst the pigeons..  It is throwing the child to the pedophiles.  That kind of a thing.  You get the idea.  The administration flocks in squabble squabble squabble everybody wants to manage media content now.  Payrises for the administration!  Payrises for the administration!  Payrises for the administrationt to keep slaves!!!  They don't pay the workers.  SO the only people 'wrokign that job' (so to speak wink wink nudge nudge chortle chortle chortle chortle snort) are the people who..  Virtue is it's own reward.  Only it isn't.  The most virtuous are required to bear allll the costs alllll the costs allll the costs allllll the costs.  Vice is it's own reward.  Those with psychopthic tedancies.  The people who wnat to do it for wrongful deathbringing bullyling and abusing and sexual violations...  Most highly valued.  They don't complain about anything or anyone.  Yessir yessir three bags full sir.  Anything anything you say sir.  Sooooo charasmatic.  Sooooo charming.  Yes sir yes sir anything you say sir.  Sucking it up sucking it up sucking it up and kicking it down.  Taking it out on the vulnerablel.  The ones who will only every be punished for complaining.  Moving the offernders around and along most highly valued employees.  The ones who didn't learn to take what they could for as long as they could just because they could from the vulnerable all 'burned themselves out all voluntary-like'.  The right royal plan to keep the region the detention camp slave land garbage producing garbage garbage garbage land of the world.  It hands it over.  I wasn't like it was going to do anyting with it.  No secondary processing.  No manufacturing.  No up-value of anything.  Take the primary resources and hand them over.  Hand them over.  Hand them over.  No secondary anything.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  Nada.  Zip.  Zilch.  Zero.  Nothing of any value at all.  Are they dead yet?  How about now?  Did they die today?  How about today?  Are they dead yet?  Alllll of the payroll for them.  Alllll  of the payroll for them.  Hav eyou written a wonderful sequel to 'sex and death' and 'the evolved apprentice' yet?  Is it an edited collection of everybody else's work???  How could cooperation possibly have evolved?  Why..  It didn't.  Nothing to see.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  It takes the f*cking thesis and it gets it to the external examiners.  No?  What the f*ck does it do, then?  Alllll of the payroll for them. Alllll of the payroll for them.  They can't even parse the constitution.  What constitution?  What laws?  What secondary processing?  What applications to enrol?  Party party party.  Let's have a party.  Let's go to 'university' to eat our f*cking lunch.  What a f*cking farce.  </p>

    <p>Amazing how many people volunteered for the gas chambers back in Germany.  Right?  Volunteered to see whether that was an effective dose for what ailed them.  All voluntary-like.  The virtual healthcare that was virtually offered to cure them of what ailed them.  They had been consented.  It was in their best interests.  Their best interests of the best interests of the team where they were required to take one for it.  Nothing has changed.  Not in this part of the world, that's for sure.  Hey, that's a great idea.  Then the peopel in this part of the world will be so happy happy happy to take up positins as third class citizens of various other places.  We can keep them moving along moving along moving along.  That's likely how people were big game hunters.  They just needed to keep them moving along for long enough for them to starve to death because the large game could't graze while walking whereas the people could.   Haha that makes us better than you in every rubric that matters.  Our vermin are still here haha.  Still breeding.  So they have something to eat when times get tough.  Sic them on the neighbours.</p>

    <p>It isn't sexist to ask what Jacina Ardern and the leader of Finland could possibly have in common such that they needed to meet in person, in New Zealand, of all places.  Why the hell would the leader of Finland travel all the way down here?  Why wasn't zoom good enough?  Why couldn't they have met half way (ish) on diplomatically neutral terrain?  The leaders of most other nations will not travel to NZ.  About it not being safe, and all, since the health system here is keeping hostages or whatever and not keeping medication records and so on.  The risk of unlawful arbitrary detention makes it not worth it.  The trade convention centre in Auckland was burned down twice.  Apparently the fault of an apprentice becuase the only engineers that woudl be acknowledged as being engineers here engineered a blowtorch such that an apprentice could  be blamed for leaving the blowtorch on unattended thereby causing a fire twice.  So say the courts.  Right?  The only lawyers who got their degrees from the finest institutions of New Zealand.  Righty, ho.  No internatioal trade conference in NZ, then.  ONe can only suppose...  Anyway...  Why on earth would the leader of Finland need to come and have a yakkity yak yak yak to Jacinda where NZ is in charge of or responsible for (or whatever) her safety while she is here.  Why oh why oh why??  What could they possibly have to discuss....  Or maybe it's personal.  Party party party, then.  Break open the booze and let's have a celebration on the taxpayers dime.  What could Jacinda possibly have to discuss with the leader of Finland?  Maybe she wants to know how she can get an honorary degree from Harvard so she can get started on the work for that now (yeah, right).  Maybe she wants to traffick some people here to our fine establishments.  Maybe some trading of slaves...  What could they possibly have to discuss? </p>

    <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/130032273/patrina-got-punched-by-a-colleague-so-why-did-she-get-sacked  She got sacked because she saw soemething that she perceived to be an injustice and she spoke out about it.  She was supposed to let the injustice slide and then take her frustration out on something beneath her.  Maybe one of the clients who she managed to isolate with no witnesses.  Maybe her dog or her children when she got home.  Doesn't matter.  Point is that she was supposed to keep her yap shut.  The aim the goal the purpose the point is to fill up the 'employment' positions with people who keep their yaps shut and vitimise people and don't complain about the victimisation that they see.  What do you think happened to the person who smashed her in the head?  Where did she get promoted to go work next?  Who wrote her a reference to say 'well she smashed someone in the head, but she never complained about anything ever.  Best employee ever.  Must have!  Would totally hire again - except the publicity...  Would recommend'.  THe only people who get references.  Right?  Glowing references.  Glowing.  Alll of the money and awards for them to celebrate their crimes!!!  </p>

    <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/world/480109/donald-trump-s-call-for-termination-of-constitution-condemned  Taking the piss is all it is.  That's what Australia needs to do.  Since the government refuses to  honor the constitution.  Be honest about that, then.  I mean to say, it is written into the Australian Constitution that NZL is a state of Australia.  Australia refuses to  honor that (for better or worse).  Australia says it doesn't have to - because it accepts that NZ did not consent to being a State of the Federation of Australia.  But what reason does anybody have to believe that teh question was ever put to the people of New Zealand?  The fact is, it is written into the constitution that NZL is in fact a State of Australia.  The signing of that constituitno was witnessed by the Queen of England.  No federal election voting papers and on election on whether or not the peopel of NZL want to be part of the Australian Federation (or if they want to be a separate country either under British or independent rule) has ever been put to the NZL people.  Australia refuses to supply voting papers to New Zealanders.  Things it's f*cking hilarous to treat NZers as second or third class Australians.  Keep NZers unemployed and preferentially give the employment positions to Australians or to outright foreigners.  Brought to NZL specifically for the purpose of taking jobs away from NZers so as to keep NZers unemployed as slaves.  F*cking farce.  So many instances of NZers having their applications thrown away and the positions (for training or employment) going only to people unable and or unwilling to do the f*cking job (e.g., Chris Whelan and various people unwilling or unable to process applications or completions or get complaints or theses to where the f*ck they are supposed to go) or readverting over and over to overseas.  So that they can find the 'we had to move this guy along because he was a pedophile bully who was violent' so NZL could do 'must have!!!'</p>

    <p>The case at the moment...  The politically contrived case...  The one where the parents say they do not give consent for their kid to have open heart surgery unless the surgeon agrees to only use blood products from people who have not been vaccinated.  The case where the courts are going to deliberate on whether or not to give temporary custody to the surgeons.  Was it?  Or the Medical Students?  Maybe the building apprentice with temporary access to the hospital?  The nurses?  Oraka Tamariki or whatever it's called, I suppose.  To sign the consent form and then hand custody back.  So,  basically, what happens is that various Government employees.  Surgeons, I suppose.  Or the nurses.  Or whomever.  Decide that this or that treatment is what they reccommend.  And if the person or the persons parents don't sign the form all voluntary-like then..  They will be forced to undergo the demanded.  Requested.  Offered.  'Treatment'.  Otherwise they will have to pay they will have to pay they will have to pay the courts.  So the judge can hem and haw and decide... But whatever the judge decides various people have already decided that the parents must pay the parents must pay the parents must pay for not having voluntarily signed the consent forms, already.  The costs must  be borne by the people who do not hurry up and comply with directive from people on government payroll.  Right?  Let this be a lesson to you all.  Don't voluntarily have a kid, in NZ, unless you are prepared to hand it over to governent workers whenever they want.  Their track record is none of your concern.  Who can afford to..  Exist in NZ.  There aren't any persons here...  I guess.  That's the ideology.  Right?  The zombie army of the world, now.  No people.   No people.  No people...  Nothing hey.  Nada zip zilch zero.  I wonder whose kid gets to have a go at open heart surgery?  I wonder who gets tempoary swipe card access to do that.  And I mostly wonder how much they had to pay the university pay the university pay teh university pay the univesrity pay teh university.  Temporarily, of ocurse.  Until it's time for them to go away...</p>

    <p>But, of course, why would you think people choose to have kids?  I mean to say why would Jacinda possibly choose to have a kid and choose to take her kid along to the UN and say that New Zealadn is the best country in the world to be a child forever because our rates of abuse of chilren are really so very very very very low and Ne wZealadn is even sending children along to meetings of the UN.  That's how good things are for children in these lands.  Carefully handpicked because they will do anything anything anything.  Right Jacinda?  When traffickign the children for the purposes of abuse is the prime export earner or whatever it is..  Then I suppose it makes sense to oput a young female face on the face of it.  Like how Epsteins partner was crucial, really, for him getting as close as he did to the various of the girls he was involved in trafficking.  I guess that's teh point of the purpose of womens rights and all that.  It would be sexist to point this out, of course.  That's why her husband needs to go with her everywehre and various other people in her entourage...  All on the taxpayers dime, of course.  The cost to the taxpayer very clear since they aren't flying military planes they are flying commercial flights with foreign airlines at least some of the time.  So there is a record of who paid for those flights.  Whether it is corruption (taxpayers dime).  Or whetehr Jacinda has to pay out of her salary for her husband and child to go with...  Of course she's just a puppet.  To ensure that people will pay MORE money to get to go anyplace else in the world.  But of course only the most psychopathic need apply.  Most valued employees ever.  Don't need to pay them.  Just throw them into communites and watch tehm take take take take take until theirs is the only game in town.</p>

    <p>'If the news reports that there were 400 people in hospital with teh virus on Sunday' then you do the math on what teh false positive rate is and how many people are in the hospital.  I mean to say if there are 4,000 people kept detained in the hospitals (for biling purposes anyway) and they administer 4,0000 Covid tests (for billing purposes anyway) then what does the false positive rate on the Covid test need to be for there to be 400 people with Covid in the hospital?  Duuuuuuuh.  Toooooo stuuuuuuuupid to do Medidcine.  Not psychopathic enough.  Wah wah wah.  The hospitals are overwhelmed by non-voluntary patients.  But it's okay we can make money by forcing them to take usk to court so the courts can award the hsopitals more and more and more and more in costs!!  Best scummity scam ever!!!!  Don't worry judges. .  ALlllll of the most timely of the very very best-est cardiac ccare for you.  Blinkity blink blink big wide eyes awwwwwww poooooor judges...  Alll of the very very best of the everyting just for you....  Yeah, right.</p>


    <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/480100/repeated-and-catastrophic-failure-abuse-in-care-commissioner-says-as-study-published  You have to wait because they have to figure how to get all your abusers payrises and new positions as most valued employees of the year because they actually really truely are most valued employees of the year.  For all the work they did having you come to accept your actual position in life.  So you could slavey slave slave slave for the children of the administration.  They could suck up suck up suck up so very very very very well because they got to take out their frustrations on you.  You were the absolute best free therapist and so on in teh whole entire world.  Right?  You just needed to sacrifice everything so that they could take everything.  That's fair.  Right?  One for the team.  Sot hat New Zealand could lead the world by providing radio graduates or something.  To the important science work.  Most valued.  Etc.  They'll murder y'all off before they pay you.  They won't pay you.  See,  you never stop paying for their crimes you never stop paying for their crimes you never stop paying for their crimes.  Because otherwise this wouldn't be the handicapped and retarded country that it is.  But is must get in behind there because instead of working to develop and improve you can simply manufacture illness and sickness and disabiltiy and disease for you enemies.  Frienemies.  Besties.  We loves you xxx.  Helping.  Helping.  On payroll to help you.  So very helpfull.  Helping me helping me helping me help myself to you...  Who is in the position of power?  HOw do they treat people who are less powerful than them?  Equality is not something that make any sense in this part of the world.  It's sooooo cmopetitive.  Someone is forced to give up everything so that someone else can live the only way they want to live.  There never will be enough to go around.  Some people wnt to live with slaves.  And there's an end to it.  Wanna have kids?  We love our kids.  We totally treat our own kids well.  Maybe.  Promise.  That' snot just free slaves...</p>

    <p>Where is Stuart McCutcheon?  I'm serious..  Where is he?  HOw many millions of New Zealand dollars did he earn in his career as VC of the University of Auckland?  HOw much money?  How much money did he take?  He wrote a thesis (that is to say a thesis was attributed to him) from Massey.  Agriculture.  How the farmers in teh South Island breed more lambs than they can feed during the winter time nd then cry cry cry to the Government that they don't have enough food for them so they need money to fly food in to them else they will die...  And cry cry cry about how they can't make a living as farmers without constant government handouts and cry cry cry about the poor little lambs that aren't gaining enough weight to be profitable for the slaughter.  For this thesis on farming best agriculture practices he gets to be Vice Chancellor of the University of Auckland.  Because that's how he works to keep the studnets, you see.  Cry cry cry cry cry for more nd more money else they'll have to starve every winter.  Cry cry cry cry cry for more and more government hndouts from the Government because he's paid...   How much money again?  Each and every year for how many years?  Decades?  To compeltely and utterly ruin the University.</p>

    <p>So where did he go with all his millions and millions and millions of New Zealand dollars, then?  Is he still in New Zealand now?  What's he doing?  Is he still on NZ Goverment payroll?  Where is he?  Did he launder the money into what...  Into where..  What foreign currency?  He could be living the life in New York or someplace with all of the millions and millions and millions of dollars he earned over the years for his job cry cry crying for government hndouts keeping student slaves as hostages.  All the work he did ruinign the University.  Where is he?  What is he doing?</p>

    <p>So they needed to get someone in from England to take over to be the new VC.  She did a couple years in Western Australia (not UWA but another Uni over there) so that she could learn about how shitty things are required to be in Australasia.  Then the state of Western Australia trades for Harlene Hayes (American, I believe) so she can continue on her good works over there (it takes the rocks from out the ground and it hands them over) refusing to sign off on completion of people who the government has put a HECS or HEX or whatever you call it on.  Those who needed government HELP because the government wants to record levesl of debt against their name because there isn't enough money for the administration.  Harlene Hayes needs a payrise.   </p>

    <p>I imagine Stuart McCutcheon is probably dead, truth be told.  I can't imagine that they actually paid him anywhere near that much.  I imagine he considered himself lucky lucky lucky to get to pretend to be on payroll at all.  I can't imagine what they actually gave him in exhange for him getting to put on a fancy suit and parade himself about pretending to be one of the most high valued most valuable employees in the whole entire world.  I imagine nothing good was offered to him in exhange...  It was largely about trafficking teenagers for crimes, I think.  I think that was actually the case.  There were cases reported in the media about people being deported after having been raped and the like.  The idea is that in order to preserve your reputation and the reputation of your family etc etc you shut the hell up about  being the victim of such crimes.  That's what the NZ courts repeatedly and persistently proclaim to the world, anyway.  So people walk away from their Degrees that they worked for for 5 years +...  They voluntarily choose to hand over all the work that they did (all the essays they wrote all the research that they wrote all the work that they did).  They just hand it over for the Univesrity to do whateer it wants with.  Credit to other people.  Sell.  Profiteer from.  Whatever.  And the students are thrown away.  Deported.  Best case.  That's what's so highliy valuable about international students.  That they can be deported.  Visas expire.  So then tehy can stay in NZ as undocumented slaves..  Else they flee.  Basically.  Flee.  There's no justice in the courts of New Zealand...  So...  Where is Stuart McCutcheon now?  Well...  What use is there for him now?  What is he doing?  Who knows..  Probably he has been redeployed somewhere else or someplace else.  Not in spite of or despite of his role previously but precisely because of it.  He would have been positively head-hunted as most valuable, I suppose.  But I also suppose that once he's outlived his usefulness he'll be put out of his misery, so to speak, relatively swiftly.  Voluntary.  Voluntarily.  Voluntarily-like.  I imagine he probably wouldn't have or want things any other way.  Right?  Nasty bruitish and short.  Except he won't see it that way.  Better to have lived the life I got to and died early.  I expect that's the idea/l or idology of it.  That he got to do varoius things that most other people never desired to do.  I'm sure...  I can't imagine what kinds of desires people have in order for them to sell out so very very many people so.  Except, of course, I can.  So..  Where is he now?  Where did he go?  I don't expect his money got to go with him, of course.  I think that's just a hoax or a scam or a scheme.  To get people doing anything anything anything anything if they think it means they get to work their way up and up and up the University administration...</p>

    <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/opinion/130671875/the-real-people-will-remain-invisible-in-this-royal-commission  Seems narrow?  Is narrow.  Was *intentionally designed to *be* narrow*.  Why did they strategically select the start and end dates that they did?  What happened immediately prior and also immediately after?  I mean to say, there were most likely (in these lands) very specific and particular intentional reasons why they selected the precise start and end dates that they did.  *And still* the inquiry will take x amount of time.  It will take at least 2xX amount of time.  It will run overtime and over budget.  It will say only what everybody knew anyway.  And all of the reccommendations will go unimplemented.  Or maybe 1 will be implimented.  Just so as they can say *we tried* and cry wah wah wah wah wah about how it's too hard and they couldn't.  But more in particular they took millions upon millions upon millions of dollars out.   Nobody else is acknowleged as having applied to have done it.  No other applications were acknowledged as having been recied.  There was nobody else.  There was no alternative.  And none of the findings will be implented anyway.  20 or 50 years late.  WElcome to New Zealand.  Only teh most psychopathic of the ibecels need apply.  Look how low Harvard needs to push and force everywhere else to be so that it can look positively attractive by comparison.  Gee I wish I could have all of the honorary degrees from Harvard.  It must be soo cool for everybody to think that I am...  What... What does it mean?  Party party party with Faucis kids.  Or something..  What does it mean??  No meaning.  let's be clear.</p>


    <p>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/med-students-say-doctor-touched-their-breasts-during-cardiac-demo/DSHSQDU5DRFFVOLKIGKR4DYSUA/ Awwwwwww.  Sooooooo disappointed they don't choose me.  Guess I didn't pass the bust circumference screen, or whatever, in my application to enrol.  Just so long as the NZ people know why it is that they don't have access to healthcare.  Etc etc.  No speak the English.  No process the applciation to enrol.  But of course, like, the only reason, like, why they are investigating her complaint, like..  Is probably  because her boyfriend is like, the kid of the admnistrator, like.  Of cooooooourse.  Yeaeeeeah.  Riiight.  That's how she gets picked for super speical programme at ripe old age of, like, 18 in the first place.  Yeeeeeeeeeah.  Cool story bro.  Awww. Don't worry honey.  Boyfriendn will get rid of super sleazy doctor bro so that his entire practice can be handed over to you.  Of course.  That's just how we do (how we don't) in retarded back to front upside down land.  Waaaaaaait.  Nooooooooo.  Tee heeee.e  THat's just how we don't.  Yeah.  Chillled and laid back...  This is how we DON'T (contribute to global economy)  Dis is how we DON'T...  Oooooh Administration pick me pick me pick me!!!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RMQksXpQSk  Just so the New Zealanders understand why there is no healthcare and no health services.  Because of the stupid games that various people like to play with teenagers handpicked for them to play those games with -- before they are cast aside.  That's the goal the aim the purpose or the point. Why would anybody voluntariliy choose to give up their salary for someone else? That's what they effectively do by signing off on the completion of another persons training.  Why would they do that?  It makes no sense.  They intentionally handpick because they think they can readily be exterminated.  How to beat them at their own game???  WHy that's how we want teh future of healthcare to be thinking about what their place their role there purpose is.  Those are the only people that we want providing offering forcing healthcare to New Zealnders.  The only game in town.  By design.  Brilliant.  Hey.  Ingenious...  Or something... </p>

    <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbcomZtKnFw  No... THe truth is that she did not get in because...  Jacinda took your qualification.  You are welcome.  Of course it is TV.  But the truth was...  We were supposed to believe...  Because more talented people applied than there were places available.  So Lewis came to terms with the fact that Rachel was talented...  But other people were, too.  So it was unluck.  Or something.  But the actual reality of the situation was that the qualifications were given to the likes of Jacinda Ardern.  And then there weren't any actual qualifications left for any of the talented people, at all.  The whole thing was nothing other than a hoax.  A scam.  A scummy sham of a nothing.  There was nothing of vlaue in teh qualification at all.  Nobody there...  Nothing home.  Allll of the everything for the elite leading rulers of the adminsitation!!!!  So that their progeny can party party party at the UN or wtich Faccui's children or, something...  F*ck knows what they are even thinking at this time...  What are they doing?  Building radio towers to the depths of space or something.. Mmm hmmm.  Putting in plans for a server space.  Well, let's see...  If I have an x-box and a cell-phone then that's how much server space from me?  If you have a phone and you have a phone and you have a phone..  How do you think it is that you fford to buy an iphone with your shitty NZ money?  I guess it's because of your contribution to cooling your component of the server space or system.  Of course.  Why do you think that you can afford to play candy crush all day?  To watch Rachel cry cry cry about how Jacinda takes all of the qualifications so that she can't attend clasess or do readings...  Jacinda just gets handed qualifications to speak at graduations...  All of the everything for Jacinda!!!! most beloved leader of the land where nobdoy even gets posted ballot papers because nobody will pay NZ post workers to deliver the f*cking things</p>

    <p>https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2022/12/jacinda-ardern-not-pointing-finger-at-nanaia-mahuta-over-three-waters-shemozzle.html  No, of course she is not pointing the finger at her.  Because that would be racist.  That's why they employed her for that position.  Because any finger pointing at her would be racist. What's that I say?  That would be racist.  Nobody else (of any race) was more competent than she.   At whatever it was that they valued.  The ability to elude any responsibility at all.  I suppose... Why didnt' she get to go on all the 'trade missions' for the missionary leader of NZ (and entourge)?  I'm sorry.  That's probably racist.  Winston Peters is Maaori.  Sssssh.  Don't tell the people in Tauranga.  He's how old???  Shhhhh.  Didn't he organise protests about genocide at some point? Meanwhile Tamaki takes up space in Mt Eden because there is no room for pedophiles and rapists in the prsons of NZ.  And various peple can't even forward an investigated case of white collar crime to the police with a bow all tied up with string...  Meredith Connell is all conflicted out with everyone who put a dollar in their pockets it's almost enough for one of them to be appointed Judge of the High Court!! </p>

    <p>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/accountant-who-describes-himself-as-profit-coach-owes-ird-800k/HXSDOCTTQNDR7PWFIIE5UEDCYA/  Well there we go.  IRD bank rolled him $800,000.  That sounds like a healthy profit to me.  I mean, good grief.  What do the shareholders want?  50c a week???  What a fucking farce of a hoax of a scam of a slum of a sham of a shitty shitty shity shitty shiity waste of a land.  Where's our Australian Federal Election Voting Papers?  Apparently we get to choose to voluntarily give up Australian Dollars in exhcange for New Zealand Soverignty because Jacinda is such a sexy sexy best that nobody can deny...  Half a million for the VC of here...  3/4 of a million for a VC there...  Half a millimo for CE of a DHB here...  Half a million for a CE of a DHB there...  wah wah wah wah wah there's no money left...  How much money do you need to be happy?  Easy.  MORE THAN MY SLAVES.  That's how much money I need to be happy.  MORE THAN YOU.  Because that's what equality meeeeeeans.  No...  That's what slavery meeeeeeeans.  Everything it is that we value.  There can never be enough money to go around because I must have more than you.  A payrise for you can only happen if I get to have payrise to re-assert my positon as lord and saviour above you . If you know what is good for you.  Would be sooooo much faster to just suck my dick already.  Say teh surgeons.  Etc.   Just so the people know why the people don't have access to healthcare.   </p>

Actually.  https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=black+lamp+atari#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:4b90bd6c,vid:t2-U1nojMdU  Pretty hard to beat that.  Maybe in better fps...  Probably...

    <p>How much money does Sir John Key need to be happy?  Why, enough so that it is relatively easy for him to stand outside a nightclub on a Friday night (so to speak) and have pretty much everybody willing to do anyting anything anytthing anything he wants at a price for him that is negligable to him.  That's about how much Sir John Key needs to be happy.  Let's ensure that the entire economy is arranged thus and so.  Now we understnd why it is tha there must never be enough to go around.  Why not everybody can have the things that they want.  In fact, often, what certain people want is to identify things that other people want and then ensure that what the other people want are withheld from them.  For no other reason than withholding things that others want from them is something that makes one feel so very very very very very much better about oneself.  That is the real purpose goal point or function of a 'needs assessment', for example.  To identify what the person says they need so as to better inforce the converse.  So that people can come to learn the true meaning or purpose or point of life.  To worship ones especially f*cking selish genes.  Meaning of life, right there.  Everything it is that we value.  THe only thing of value.  The *definition* of value in any meaningful sense at all.  I mean, Christ, you don't need to do any classes or courses in philosophy for state the obvious to be f*cking obvious.  Just hand out the honorary degrees already and ensure the payscale is handed out accordingly.  Just so the people are clear on why there is no healthcare, judiciary, education etc etc.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.</p>

    <p>https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2022/12/cheating-university-students-being-blackmailed-by-companies-paid-to-write-their-assignments.html  Well, this is the fake news.  New Zealand Universities do not fail students for cheating.  New Zealand Universities think that Crimson Education is a wonderful start-up company and they intentionally supply them with the examination questions and answers or both so that New Zealanders can play a game that is marketed as being pay to win their qualififations from New Zealand Universities.  The courts have ordered the Crimson Education stuff that was heard in the High Court to be quiet.  Right?  I don't remember seeing the Media reporting on the Court or Legal outcome of what Crimson Education was doing or what they were up to with how they were trying to turn the Universities of NZ into very blatant pay to win institutions.  Not saying that people actually did pay to win.  They paid to play.  That was the idea.  The ideology.  See, one major reason why it's sooooo cmopetitive to get into Medicine is you can then sell the teset questions or answers to the kids in a certain residential hall or graduates from a certain HIgh School or whatever.  To the highest bidder.  Whether you sell them the answers or whethe ryou take their money and give them bullsh*it..  Well..  What are they going to do about it?  The point of Turnitin, as best I can figure, is that the good essays are failed.  Teh studnet is given a failing grade.  So then the assignment that was uploaded to turnitin can be sold to someone else.  So the kids from Princeton, say (an institution which does not use Turnitin, they say) can hand in the work of the studnets who are failed out of Auckalnd or Waikato or Australian National or what have you.  I mean...  What University would voluntarily choose to hand over the intellectual property of the students at the institution?  Handing it over by forcing students to upload it to Turnitin in the name of detecting plgarism.  Give us all your stuff so that we can take a look see and see if it's genuine.  Give us all your stuff. Just  hand it over.  Hand it over.  ANd then they can hand it back graded by teh online grading grinder (no need to pay anybody to grade it they can assign grades on teh basis of the parental address and the race and so on).  How to keep the most stupid an dignorant population in the world.  Right VC?  Best be taking another millino for you.  ANother million for you.  Quickly quickly quickly fast as ya can...</p>

    <p>I mean, here is the thing...  THe fake news is based on this assumption or idea that things are fairly graded such that it would be *possible* for people to cheat  by having others do their work for htem.  I mean to say, the assumption or idea (that happens to be false) is that once the work is done the credit is obtained.  So the question is only around who the author of the work was...  But that's false, you see.  This website documents how when a studnet does the work that is required... They are failed out of the university.  So...  Supppose that you pay someone else to give you your finished laboratory assignment for first year chemistry or physics or biology or biochemistry labs, say.  Let's suppose that your parents pay for there to be a tutor employed by the residential hall, say, and the tutor employed for Carrington College, say, just gives the students who live at that college the answers to the labs that they are supposed to actually be doing during the labs (and various other studnets staying at various other halls or living independently don't have the same information going into the lab.  THey don't hae the completed lab manuals to take in with them so they only need transcribe the answers into their own books).  I mean...  That doesn't happen in New Zealand.  Right?  My point is...  I couldn't make a living doing other peoples work for them because when I hand in the work -- they would fail me out.  Do you see?  There is no way they would pass me for first year assignments in Public Health.  NOt because I didn't do my own work.   But because I did do my own work.  What you need to do in order to get a passing grade..  Is be one of the people hand-picked in advance for all of the qualities they value.  One really really high up the list of what it is that they value is one of the ones hand picked to be given the answers (that are withheld from most others) and then repeate that back (and only that) on demand.  So, for example, the students for public health would stick together the lecturers powerpoint slides into essay format and type the sentences into google to get 3 references per line.  And / or they would take their draft of an essay along to the tutor who would (if you blinkity blink blinked your big cute eyes at them a bit and did anyting anything anytihng anything) rewrite it for you.  That's how you 'earn' a pass.  When you get that invitation to 'come and see me so we can have a little yakkity yak yak behind closed doors a little 1 on 1'.  </p>

    <p>Sigh.  Let's face it, the grades thing doesn't matter, anyway.  Otago said (for the courts) that the 'alternative' criterion is often used to enrol students in Medicine directly when they have never studied at university level before.  So they have no grades at all from them.  They hand picked them for non-academic reasons (to do with how well they fit in passing themselves off as being qualified already, one can only suppose).  They decide that since they know what the game is already may as well let them pay the university pay teh university pay the university.  They never have to give them the qualification completion and there isn't really any way tehy can complain with any legitimacy since they were only selected for precisely that reason for precisely that purpose.  Various other studnets..  Let's see.  The private boarding school from Cambridge.  Wehre was it?  St Something...  I'd imagine the parents consider themselves to be paying really rather a lot and what they expect in return is for their kids to be given the questions and the answers to the NCEA examinations.  They expect for their kids to be given the questions and answers to the First Year Health Science Curriculum.  Then their kids only need a B- average and they can take up their places in second year medicine in the name of 'rural equity'.  I mean to say..  Everything everything everything everything handed to these kids on a platter (the answers outright given to them worst case.  Best case they are handed the questions in advance so the material they need to actually learn is sometihng that is actually learnable in the availabel time with a full time workload).  We are supposed to be fawning over how smart these kids must be...  But you need to meet them and have a yakkity yak yak to see...  Just so the people can understand why we dont' have healthcare...  FUnctioning judiciary...  Quicklky quickly quickly take all the money out...</p>

    <p>It isn't like anybody gets to choose their parents.  I'm not saying all of the kids or all of the parents are like this.  But I am saying there is an aspect or an element.  And no good comes (often enough) of 17 year olds thinking that they can do anyting anything anything they like with complete and utter immunity becuase that's what they see their parents and so on and so forth doing in fact.  Of course I understand that they are studying (if they are) for Cambridge Curriculum or US university entrance exams.  Not for NCEA.  That's a crap shoot.  I think you say.  Insofar as the script makes sense...  Insofar as it's graded properly...  It's a crap shoot. Designed to keep otherwise intelligent people as hostages in the scum land so best I can figure or see.  Reduce the number of people submitting applications to study in the US or England or whatever so the kids of the wealthy elite ar ethe only game in town.  I suppose the idea, then, is to extract as much money out of the parents as you can.  Figure out which ones will hand over the most and what sorts of reasons or whatever will get that money out of them.  If they will pay more for keeping quiet some videos they shot of darling in a frat house or residential hall..  Quite how that's supposed to go..  What evidence they can collect up of all their crimes all their crimes..  How much their parents will pay for them to get to take some photos of them in a silly gown on graduation.  I don't know.  How the f*ck is it supposed to go?  What are we supposed to think, at this point?  It takes the work and it gets it to external examiners who have no idea who it's mummy or daddy is.  They examine the work on it's academic merits.  But that isn't happening.  It was obvious to everybody that I was the author of the work that I wrote.  Nobody thought that I had plagarised any of it.  And the fact that I did my own work and did not plagarise it ment that they recorded that I failed.  When the external examiner asked specifically for an oral defence from me (since the Univesrity hadn't signed off on completion of my qualification already) the university refused to schedule one.  Again, not becuase they thought I couldnt' handle myself in an oral defense.  They refused to schedule one because they knew full well that I could.  They already had one in the f*cking reports the Dean told me I needed to write to the NZ examiner justifying why I hadn't doubled the length of the 50,000 words 120 point 1 EFT MPhil thesis when I never applied to be enrolled in a 100,000 word PhD with the Universiyt of Waikato and when they had no right to send my thesis out for examination for the wrong degree.  I mean the level of incompetence and ineptitude..  Defies credibility.  Where did all the research funding go?  The Waikato District Health Board apparently offered $5,000 Masters scholarship for someone to do a 50,000 words 1 EFT research project.  WHere is the thesis that they funded?  I ask because I expect that what happened was that the studnet who obtained that award (maybe wasn't even paid the money at all) and they either bullied her into handing the work over and leaving without the qualification so they could pass it off as their own work in 5 or 10 or 15 years time...  Else..  What?  Is she still there working on it?  Nothing there.  Nobody home.  All these people on payroll to do research stealing the outputs of the kids and passing that off as their own.  Nothing there.  Nobody home.</p>

    <p>Did the family get to check that Malachi was actually dead?  I ask that because he was a really beautiful little boy.  I'm sure he would have been very desirable to someone out there.  Maybe even someone willing to pay government workers a living wage, for a while, to make that happen.  If they didn't get to see that he was dead in fact (maybe because he wasn't going to keep his yap shut about something or other) then, if he was buried, you might want to get a DNA test just to check that it really is that little guy buried there down in the ground.  I would say that it's...  Only dubiously likely.  I mean..  Whatever happened to the eye surgeon who maybe possibly murdered his wife to live with his hooker in Sydney?  Who do you think he would have signed off on as having completed their medical training?  Who do you think he would have failed out?  What ever happened to the Orthopedic surgeon from south africa who came here and his children were taken away and his wife is to spend her reamining days in hillmorton?  What is he up to now?  What ever happened to the medical student who was supplying party drugs to teengers in dunedin who killed one of them?  He apparently killed himself in prison.  Did they get to see the open casket to verify that he wasn't off party party partying with Epstein somewhere?  Maybe Queensland?  What a f*cking farce of a hoax of a scummy scummy scam in the f*cking waste of a waste land.  </p>

    <p>I see one of the standard treatments that is standardly provided on taxpayers dime to the people of Australia is now being provided to people with that condition in New Zealand. How very Big of them.  Wah wah wah the problem is that Australia doesn't have enough money.  The Government doesn't have enough money to keep New Zealanders in anything other than conditions of relative poverty and deprivation.  How many kids died, previously, without treatment?  Alll the money spent on a Kings Council to take custody of one particular kid to make a point that the right to refuse Medical Treatment doesn't count.  I mean, the Australian Constitution doesn't count.  Of course the Bill of Rights doesn't count.  Nothing counts.  Yeah.  The problem must be my maths that things just never do add up.  Yeah...  It's all me.  That's the problem.  Sure.  Yeah.  Right.  Quickly quickly quickly take the millions out.  Quickly quickly quickly.  </p>

    <p>Maybe when Farcebook says 'we can't find or give you the information you are asking for, New Zealand Government' it means to say 'we are not going to help the leaders of a nasty autocratic reigime like you'.  I just unencrypted the message for you.  You are welcome.  Pay me never.</p>

    <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/pou-tiaki/130679483/new-health-alliance-aims-for-equitable-care-for-preterm-babies  Yikes.  I thought that giving pregnent women cortico-steroids induced premature delivery.  It matured the foetus' lungs preparing them for premature delivery.  But maybe I'm wrong.  The idea wasn't to have as many prematurely delivered infants as possible so that certain special other people's kids could be the only game in town.  Course not.  https://www.tommys.org/research/research-topics/premature-birth-research/what-are-effects-corticosteroids-babies-born-term  Ooh oooh oooh pick me pick me pick me!  Pick on MY baby for YOUR experiment!  Pick on the vulnerable people in the name of equity!  All of the money for you.  All of the money for you.  All of the money for you.  Quickly quickly quickly take all of the money out...  I mean, it's one thing if the Mother is in the position to take a read of various things and decide whether or not they want to take the corticosteriods.  It's another thing for the Mother to be told that some Medical Doctor or other thinks that that's the right decision and if she doesn't comply with Medical Directive she better arm herself with lawyers because the Government will hire a KC to award custody to the Government to force her to take corticosteriods.  It's not an experiment, you see.  It's an observational study.  Of *other people's* children, noticably.  Notably.  The children of the *other*.  The *other* being the ones who never ever ever ever ever would be, for example, selected into something like Medical School.  Chortle cortle snort.  https://arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13075-021-02699-1.  The women there were taking cortocosteriods as treatment for a condition they had prior to pregnancy.  That's a bit different.  I would say...  They needed to decide whether to get pregnant and try and balance effects of their condition with dose of medication that could be harmful to their unborn child.  That's different from giving women steroidds in the name of helping their baby's lungs develop better since they decided they wanted it for a Fisher and Paykel incubator baby.  I would have thought...</p>

    <p>So, it's a thing with the stenois of the valves.  Usually from Rheumatic Fever types of problems of complications.  Bacteria gets into the bloodstream and the bacteria gets on the heart valves.  Vegitations.  Then the bodies own immune cells latch onto the vegitations.  Then the bodies immune cells chomp up the abtibodies -- and also the heart valves as some kind of collateral damage.  I had thought that the main problem with Rheumatic Fever was the unhealthy housing.  But I guess you probably would need to look into the prevalence of that in the Fisher and Paykel incubtor babies of New Zealand.  I know that if you don't clean respiratory equipment and devices, including ventillators, that can be a real problem.  Because you, effectively, mechancically blast or force the contaminted air really deep down into the lungs.  Perhaps damaging or irritating them from the blast of forced ventilltion.  But carrying contaminants and bacteria or viruses or whatever too.  Don't worry, I'm sure they pay the technicians who are responsible for keeping the equipment maintaine dto internationally accepted stndards.  They are trying to make a vaccine for Rheumatic Fever...  So I guess that means they want there to be lots of it about.  THey withhold anticiotics from humans (in the name of not wanting to provoke antibiotic resistence) but then they don't prescribe them properly (e.g., allowing individuals to hvae a full course of them when in hospital when there aren't doctors about to sign off on more doses after they've been given one off doses in the ED of the hospital).  And they prophylactically give tehm to cows and chickens in ways that are often not in beset accord with best international practice either.  It' slike they read the internatinal best practice recommendations and go 'but that's what you do when you are trying ot prevent and prohibit things like rheumatic fever.  But our goals in our unique socioculturl environment are different.  We aim to increase it increaese it incdrease it.  More money!  Pay us more money!  Pay us more money for the mess that we made!  We will invest and re-invest and New Zealand can be teh worlds destination so Faucci's kids can come here and party party party and see Rheumatic Fever in the wild'.  Or something...</p>

    <p>My point is that I didn't think that kids under about the age of 5 were presenting with damage from Rheumatic Fever.  Of course that might not be what is going on in the current case before the High Court.  But it is interesting to me that 'First Aid for the USMLE ORgan Systems' book states about Rheumatic heart disease.  So it's a thing around the world, then?  Or it' sa thing that's well documented as happening in New Zealand?  Documented and understood enoguh for it to make a prominent appearance in the USA Medical Doctors standard learning / training literature.  I mean to say.  That's kind of interesting, hey.  WIth respect to the real drivers behind much of this.  Still, I feel that it is the job of locals to look out for local interests.  Not selifishly.  But because they are positioned better to see what is going on.  The costs and so on.  But I guess if peple are soooo competitively trying ot kill everyone in their local environment so they can take all of their stuff for themselves then where is the harm in international community jumping on that particular bndwagon and doing business with the greedy grubby sell-outs?  </p>

    <p>I should probably disclose that my particular stake in the rheumatic fever in infants or children issues is rather influenced by the Dean who refused to calculate my GPA properly being a prominent person in the reearch into rheumatic fever vaccination project.  I was very interested to see what his laboratory would pivot to during Covid lockdown.  To the best of my knowledge it pivoted to...  Nothing.  Oh most esteemed graduate of Harvard.  That's a nice research thesis they credtied you as having completed, there.  I'm sure you play a role in getting the data out...  Possibly.  Not sure why you woul dneed to when they hand it all over to international cloud servers, anyway, to the best of my knowledge.  Have it passed through Google or prepared on Microsoft software or what have you...  But anyway, my point is that he very very determinedly would not calculate my GPA properly and enter it into the selection algorithm.  I'm watching you.. Oh yes, I am.  Alll of the money for you, all of the money for you, all o the money for you. ANd PhD students from developoing nations, too, in the name of equity, no less...  I wrote you a thesis?  Did you like it?  I was thinking of you at various points. I thought it polite not to name names.  It's not personal.  </p>
