                            The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications.  They define a 120 point program of study (e.g., the 120 point MPhil program of study that I applied to be enrolled in) as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a>.  The Universities of New Zealand refuse to accept this, however.  They believe they are entitled to withhold qualifications and force re-enrolments in order to collect more momey from the student for enrolment and in order to obtain more money from the Government or external funders for them keeping the student-slave.
                            </p>

                            <p>  
                            The University of Otago (1) refuses to supply applications to some candidates (2) throws away applications from some candidates prior to assessing the application on it's merits (3) collects up disability information prior to selection for purposes of exclusion only (there is no equity pathway for disability).  The High Court of New Zealand has found that there is nothing legally wrong with the public University of Otago choosing to conduct it's business in this manner.  I filed with the Court of Appeal but they refuse to progress my filings because I did not have $7,060 to pay the security for costs amount required by the courts.  The University of Otago chose to require me to bring this to the courts.  The Univesrity of Otago chose not to put things right internally.  The present Univesrsity of Otago Vice Chancellor chooses not to put things right internally.  They believe they are entitlted to select whomever they want for whatever program they want for whatever arbitrary reasons they want.  I post my filings with the Court of Appeal here.  You may want to consider this situation (with the Univesrity of Otago and also with the Courts of New Zealand) very carefully before you decide whether you want to do business with New Zealand:
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  The Justice for the High Court Proceedings was one who seems to have been pulled out of retirement for the occasion.  The government chooses to get judges out of retirement rather than appointing new judges.  I do not know if the judges grand-son or great grand-son was offered a place in a program (or graduation from a program) for his role in the proceedings.  Decide for yourself the value of a University of Otago Degree.

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings on grounds that it had already passed judgment on the filings and would not revisit the issue.  They did not think my filings sufficient to show there had been a grotesque injustice in how they handled my filings.  I post them here so you can judge for yourself.

                            The Australian Constition says that New Zealand is a State of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  And yet the State Government of New Zealand does not get tax money to the Federal Government and the Public Schools and Hosptials of New Zealand do not get Federal Funding from the Australian Government and the workers are not paid Australian Wages.  We do not extradite kim.com with Australian Copyright Laws.  We do not collect Capital Gains Tax with Australian Laws.  The New Zealand Government pays various people excess of $200,000 New Zealand Dollars per year to dither about refusing to do those things (and many other things besides).

                            The Universities of Otago and Auckland are not being fair as to how they are choosing what students to enrol in Medicine.  It wasn't that Dr Leeks (Dr Green etc) happened to slip through a selection criterion or process objectively and fairly applied.  It was that he or they was or were hand-picked or specially chosen for demonstrating all the qualities it is that they value.  I suppose, then, Dr Leeks was transferred to Melborne because that is also what they value over there.  I don't see what else we are supposed to think about that when they harbor him they way they have chosen to.  They are not even trying to be fair.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The Universities and courts have broken the social contract.  The Courts have chosen to set precedent that it will cost upwards of $20,000 to take a case against the University to the High Court, and even then they work to delay and obstruct and prohibit and prevent justice.  
                            </p>

                             <p>New Zealand appears to be a detention or slave camp.  New Zealand is a state of Australia.  Australia chooses to supply New Zealand Dollars to New Zealanders to prevent them travelling domestically (many of them) and to disguise just how low the wages are kept in New Zealand for the majority of Government Employees.  They will not pay the teachers, police, nurses, etc.  They will pay the managers and administrators:  https://www.taxpayers.org.nz/ceo_rich_list They do not value the lives of New Zealanders.  They do not allow qualification progression and completion.  They are not fair in their allocation of training places.  They are not fair in their process of advertising (if they even do) or appointing people for paid jobs. If you complain about this the whole attitude is: 'And so what!  What are you going to do about it!'  They are not willing and / or able to be empathetic, compassionate, or fairminded, at all.
                            </p>

                            <p>This website was set up so that I could put most of my academic work on here (the work I can find).  Because I have not been credited appropriately for my work, over the years.  I have done considerable amounts of graduate research work, particularly, and the people who were paid to help me worked only to undermine and stabotage me, insofar as I can see.
                            </p>

                            <p> I put in an application to start another PhD with the ANU last year (since they haven't acknowledged tht I have done enough for a PhD already) to see what would happen with my application.  When I applied I said I was not really interested in starting over from the beginning again, and was more interested in recieving credit for the work I had done for them already.  What seemed fair?  6 months to get everything into shape before it goes to externals?  What seems fair?  Bundle and send everything as is?  I said I wanted to study and practice Medicine.  Only I wasn't sure if there was any Medicine in Australasia because there doesn't seem to be any respect, at all, for informed consent.  So, there aren't 'cervical examinations' there are 'sexual assaults' and there aren't 'surgeries' there are 'physical assaults', and so on.  
                                </p>

                            <p>
                            Otago has recently claimed that a reason why graduation was cancelled and we didn't see any research students publically credited with having completed their research qualification was because they received threats of violence from a former student.  It does occur to me 'there is no excuse for threats of violence'.  But it also occurs to me that there is no excuse for how Otago has chosen to treat it's students.  What options are there for students or employees or slaves or volunteers when people who have kept them working or studying do not honor terms and when the courts refuse to uphold the law?  It might be possible to escape...  1/4 of the population of New Zealand has fled.  I find myself thinking 'it's the brain drain' and I find myself thinking about the brain drain 'if you have any brains then you will flee far away from here'.  And I find myself then thinking about flocks of migrants who are treated horribly everywhere they go.  False promises of a better life and then being kept as second or third class citizens.  And I wonder why it is that those who are wronged should be forced to flee and why it is that those who are doing the wrongs should  be allowed to persist in their wrongs.     
                               </p>

                               <p>
                                The Education and Training Act 2020 and the Education Acts prior to that all stated that domestic adults who had attained the age of 20 years were eligible to  be enrolled in the programme they applied to.  They stated that teenagers (under the age of 20 years) were able to be enrolled by the University only if the University was satisfied that they were able to complete the course.  So, when we hear of a Univerity being satisfied enough that a teenager could complete the course so as to enrol them and take their money and we then hear of the University failing them for their course not only once, but two years in a row, then it really looks like the University has some explaining to do as to how it was that they could not pass the student.  The High Court of Dunedin did not see it that way because the Judges don't seem willing or able to understand justice.  They appear to be some combination of unwilling or unable to do their job. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The New Zealand Government has chosen to create and impose incentive structures incentivising slavery.  Preventing and prohibiting the development of training systems and skilled labor.  
                                </p>

                                <p>New Zealand does not necessarily have a shortage of people with skills.  It (1) refuses to enrol people with capacity (2) refuses to progress people with capacity (3) refuses to graduate people with capacity (4) refuses to publically advertise jobs (5) refuses to hire people with capacity to do the jobs (6) refuses to pay them.  It determinedly refuses to allow skilled work to be done.  Once the managers and administrators have taken up all the money they think they are worth and they think they are entitled to they still think they are entitled to keep slaves or hostages.  Apparently there just isn't enough money left for everybody else.
                                </p>

                                <p>I don't know if the Australian National University will put things right.  Compare the work I did with the work of others where the others were acknowledged as having done their work and I was not.  Are we really supposed to believe that the current cohort of PhD students was more highly qualified for PhD enrolment than me?  Or do you simply choose which students to enrol on the basis of Kim Sterelny not wanting to kill cute young things?  Maybe if I had have house-sitted for him more he would have acknowledged the work I did?  Maybe if I cried to him more that I was not capable of working independently and I needed him to help me write it or write it for me or tell me what to think so I could write that down and he could accept what I had to say, then, in something approximating real-time?  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I wrote my thesis for Waikato before Covid.  My views on immunisation have changed after seeing how various things unfolded with Covid etc.  My views on the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People and the relationship between that and the Treaty of Waitangi etc have also evolved.  After I was not given any credit or acknowledgement or funding to have worked on my Masters research (which was apparently an area that was high priority at the time -- which seems to be code-speak for off limits or not allowed or most unwanted) various other people have been paid rather a lot to...  Take my ideas and pass them off as their own?  Is that the idea of it?  Take the work of the Masters students.  Flunk out the Masters students.  Get the $90,000 a year Government Employees to pass that work off as their own?  That sounds about right.  The scholarship funding is, often, not getting to the students.  The reason they ask you to do research grant applications or funding proposals or even submitting engineering design plans or submitting things for intellectual property or submitting things for business grants etc...  They decline you funding for your idea.  Then they steal your idea and pass it off as their own.  If you bring anything to them for patient or whatever then they will shut you down and steal it for themselves.  There isn't any way for those kinds of things to function, here.

                                So what we do all day is we document the crimes of the government, we document the crimes of the government, we document the crimes of the government.  We cry cry cry about how they refuse to pay their workers and peruse the 'civil servant' rich-list of most valued chief executives who think it's very very clever of themselves to force other people to abandon legal action against them because security for costs was set as a percentage of salary?  And where the QC is a perk of their job and legal aid representation and amicus is not allowed by the court system.  Where there is no precedent for costs to be awarded to a self represented litigant.  Where there is no precedent for wages to be paid to a self represented litigant (I don't bill as a lawyer because they don't recognise I have a law degree -- I don't think they would acnkowledge that anybody who chose to represent me had a law degree.  I think choosing to represent me would be choosing to be dis-owned by the universities of Australasia).  
                                </p>

                                Who wins the election makes no difference in New Zealand.  The Administration does not change. The rich-list of 'public-servants' does not change.  'Election' is mere window-dressing.  We have seen what was required for a change in the leadership in Samoa...  Tonga...  What will it take for New Zealand to get with the Development Program already? 
                                </p>

                                At times I find myself wondering if they are intellectually handicapped.  And then I think that isn't very nice of me to think.  And then I think about the various intellectually handicapped people who I have met, over the years, and it isn't that they are intellectually handicapped. It is that something entirely different is what is going on.  For example, if you read the New Zealand High Court Rules on Costs they seem pretty fair (though a little hard to understand).  The point of the Costs is not to compensate the lawyer (or self-represented litigant) for their time.  It is not based on the skill of the lawyer (or self-represented litigant).  It is also not based on the time it takes the lawyer (or self represented litigant) to do the step.  The point of the costs judgment or award is to try and create an incentive structure that is fair.  So that lawyers come to learn what good lawyering looks like (in terms of filing the things it is good for them to file and not filing things that are obstructing or delaying proceedings unncessarily).  The problem is that the judges refuse to...  Understand it?  Apply it?  I don't know what their problem is...  Likely... Being the son of a son of a son of a judge does not make you a good judge. 

                                <p>
                                For example, the lawyer acts on or under instructions from the client.  So it isn't Mr Perkins fault that Ailsa Claire instructed him to file motion to have my proceedings struck out.  When Ailsa Claire instructed Mr Perkins to file a 'motion to have proceedings struck out' if he was competent he would have advised her that they would be unlikely to succeed in that filing.  Firstly,  90 per cent of cases brought before the courts are not struck out prior to a substantive  hearing of the issue.  Secondly, evidence that has  been entered in, seems fairly straightforwardly to establish the truth of the applicants allegations. She was unlawfully detained in a not fit for purpose seclusion room and drugged.  I'm sure Mr Perkins would have supplied more reasons than that.  The courts would (in a nation that was rule of or by law) want to establish precedent by showing all the baby lawyers out there not to file motion to have proceedings struck out -- unless the proceedings were clearly vexatious or fiviolous.  The bar on that is very high.  Generally or normally or typically it is not good lawyering to file all the things can can be filed just  because they can be filed.  Mr Perkins isn't a good lawyer because he filed motion to have proceedings struck out (he lost that step and Ailsa Claire should have been forced to pay for ordering him to do something he should have advised her not to do).  He is a good lawyer because he advised her properly.  No?  What is he supposed to advise her when the courts refuse to order costs appropriately?
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                New Zealand obviously does not have a functioning judiciary.

                                The Judges have not been distinguishing costs (to do with punishing unnecessary steps in the proceedings etc) from lawyers being paid for the work they do or for their time.  This seems to be to withhold paying lawyers for their time doing social justice type of work.  Preventing lawyers from being able to make a living by representing (well -- not taking unnessary steps or bring vexatious filings to the courts) but by bringing good cases where there is an injustice by people powerful enough to put right their wrongs (especially the government when you look at how much money they pay their 'civil servants' to do wrongs and to stand by while others commit wrongs on their watch). That is to say, the judges should have ordered the government to pay (1)  The costs involved in the Lake Alice Proceedings.  The entire thing was unncessary.  It should not have had to go before the courts.  The Government had many opportunities to put many things right without it going before the courts but they refused.  The Government chose to obstruct and prevent and prohibit.  They chose to pay Una Jagose to destroy evidence and order Crown Law to make it go away in a manner or way that punished the victims.  I could have done a better job than her (and only demanded 'average' wage) by simply doing nothing at all.  I mean..  Having the position unfilled would have been doing a better job of it than her obstructing and getting in the f*cking way.  (2)  The legal fees of the lawyers who represented the victims.  So they can make a living.  It is a little unclear to me.  Something about 2/3rds.  I think the idea is that the legal fees (to be paid to Mr Perkins or whomever) is not to exceed the costs award by more than 3x.  One lawyer.  Maybe also an associate.  Not sure about class action.  Mr Perkins is a QC so he gets the maxmium.  He is also most accountable to the Law Society etc for, for example, advising the DHB not to do vexatious filings (like insisting on his filing a motion to have proceedings struck out when the evidence before the courts documents their guilt).  ffs.  It's really not supposed to be this hard.

                                Corruption.  New Zealand does not appear to have a functioning judiciary.  I suppose it's similar reasoning to why it doesn't have a Medical System. It refuses to pay the competent workers (the social justice lawyers) in order to pay the son of the son of the first person off the boat however many years ago..  Whether or not he wanted to be a lawyer the chortle-snort white-people know what is best for you and what your contribution to New Zealand society is required to be.  It isn't intellectual handicap...  It is something different, entirely...

                                The problem is not that the lawyers don't know how to bill.  The problem is that the Judges don't know how to be fair.

                                Once upon a time two women both had babies, around the same time.  One of babies died, in the night.  The next morning both of the women said that the other woman's baby had died and claimed that the living baby was their own.

                                The Judge said:  `I cannot decide!  We must cut the baby in half and you can have half each.  That sounds fair.'  One of the women said 'yes!' and the other said 'no!  Don't harm the baby.  Give the baby to her.'  The Judge said of the second woman 'you are the rightful caregiver of the baby'.  The judge gave the  baby to her.
