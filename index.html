 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>More than 4 months waiting on the Social Security Tribunal who still has not outputted a judgment.  </p>

                                <p>I see why they pay them</p>

                                <p>Chris Whelan has not properly processed a single complaint of wrondoing since he was appoitned to office in about 2014.  I see why they pay him.</p>

                                <p>Justice Toogood didn't see anything wrong with the death of Mason Pendrous, Olivia Podmore.  He didn't see anything wrong with the University of Waikatko enrolling me in program of study I never applied to, he didn't see anything wrong with them keeping false enrolent records, false transcripts.  Refusing to get students work to external examiners so it could be examined on it's academic merits for the qualification the studnet had applied to.  I see why they re-appointed him.  Cancelled his retirement.  PUt him back on payroll.</p>

                                <p>The GPs won't retire.  Not voluntarily.  And they won't sign off on anybody else being able to do it.  We will just keep paying them to gloat about how racist they are.  Maybe they sign off on their own children since they think their children can be put to work to cover up their crimes.</p>

                                <p>I have put in OIA requests for information to know how much the Universities of NZ have paid to external counsel to try and have the courts proclaim to the world that NZ Universities are functioning as slave prison or detention camps refusing to properly process applications to enrol, progressions through training, refusing to sign off on completion of grad studnent research.  How much the government invested in protecting the governments right to commit whatever crimes against the people.</p>

                                <p>The Universities choose to payroll people who, they say, produce no research output.  Who, in turn, say their studnets produce no research output.  Universities with little to no research output.  Not Universities.  Not even trying to be.</p>

                                <p>I am quite the money cow for the courts now.  After being the money cow for how many years for various universities?  The ANU wouldn't get my work to external examiners...  I don't know that they actually got anybodies work to external examiners.  I think they just give PhDs to whoever they want for whatever arbitrary reasons they want.  I don't know that they did actually send any of the students work out to be externally examined.  They just picked some people to help them manage the slave detention camp whereby they have various money cows who just keep on giving them research that they can sell or give or credit to someone else.  </p>
