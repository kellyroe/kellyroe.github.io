                            Who has applied to study a 120 point 2 EFT research masters qualification and had that signed off as completed within 34 weeks of enrolment?  Anybody?  Can you name me one person? 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Who has applied to study a 360 point 3 EFT doctoral qualification and had that signed off as completed within 3 academic years of enrolment?  Anybody?  Can you name me one person?
                            </p>

                            <p>Can you name for me a single person who has had their graduate level research *sent out for external examination by the University* in time for the externals to *possibly* sign off on completion of the qualifiation within the enrolment period?  I mean to say, if it takes 3 months to externally examine a 1 year research project with a 34 week enrolment period then the theis will need to go out to externals at around the 22 week mark.  Can you name for me a single research student who has had their research sent out for external examination no later than the 22 week mark?  A single student?</p>

                            <p>What University?</p>
