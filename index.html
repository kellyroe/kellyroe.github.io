                                <p>
                                    People are lonely for community?  But it's sooooooooooo competititive!  It's sooooooooooo competitive!  It's sooooooooooo competitive.  There never will be enough to go around and people are like chickens with the pecking order and being with people is just a constant fight of 'I'm better than you' and 'I'm trying to stab you in the back' and 'I'm just  frienemy really trying to figure how to make myself look better than you'.  It's a fight for the all-important resources.  Money to pay pretty young things to do anything anything anything outside a nightclub on a Saturday night, and so on.  It's such a friendly friendly place to be, New Zealand.  Yeah, right. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                   The function of purpose of this thing they like to call 'Law', in New Zealand, appears to be a mechanism or way of the powerful to oppress others.  THe laws aren't things that protect the people or serve their interests.  The interests of community, say.  The laws are things that prevent and prohibit community by themselves simply being an expression of the depravity of those who knew in the depths of their hearts that the real meaning or purpose or function or point of life was to grubby grub grub their way up some social hierarchy where they could do anything anything anything with complete and utter impunity. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                   Nice. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Now think about what 'Medicine' and 'Healthcare' means in a nation such as this...  Ashley needs to earn half a million dollars per year  because he knows full well if he wants healthcare he will need to pay for it overseas.  International tourist rates.  If he needs an ambulance at the bottom of a cliff it's a chopper ride to Sydney, at the very least.  Assuming they have Medical Doctors.  I mean the Australian National University doesn't seem willing or able to process applications to enrol, these days.  Can't / won't supervise graduate student research (check my former supervisors email outbox for evidence to the contrary).  Can't / won't get studnets work out to externals for it to be externally examined even if it can't / won't employ anybody willing and / or able to supervise graduate student research.  I mean, if that's the state of the Australian Natioanal University, and every other University in Australasia is forced to 'get in behind' that state of affairs then it really isn't hard to see, at all, why there is no community in Australasia.  Despite their very best efforts to educate us otherwise with such gems as 'Home and Away', 'Neighbours', and 'Shortland Street'.

                                <p>Of course, the easiest way to win a social hierarchy competition is the 'I am the only game in town' and 'there is no alternative' and 'how low can we go' exercise or activity of trying to stabotage or undermine everybody else.  Instead of creating you can simply destroy.  And that's what we see.  THe prevention and prohibition of social development.  What was that, Sterelny?  We are all slaves to some people's selfish selfish selfish.  And the selfish that's apparently or allegedly in their genes (therefore not their fault, they can't help it, one can only suppose) ensures that everything gets overtaken and taken over by psychopaths.  For sure.  So that anything of any value doesn't actually remain for any particular length of time.  It's a f*cking miracle that there is anything at all.  Any co-operation.  Any con-munity.  Miracle.  Gee...  Better take allllllll the research funding to write about it.  The New Canberra Plan, we could call it.  The race to the bottom.  For sure.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Some things were nice about Canberra...  The problem was the lack of social conscience.  Frienemies.  Riiiiiight.  It's soooooooo fun to hang out with frienemies.  The only research game in town.  
                                </p>

                                <p>Shame New Zealand doesn't really have journals...  Research outputs.  But they're supposed to get in behind, there.  I suppose there's a faint dim hope that people might get airlifted to Sydney for Medical Treatment.  But I don't know why we would think that there would be any Medical Treatment in Sydney.  I mean, if Canberra can't process applications to enrol, can't train people at Univesrity, can't get work to external examiners, then what hope is there for the rest of Australasia?  It takes the rocks from out the ground...  And it hands them over.  For sure.  The only game in town.</p>
