                        <div class="container">

                            <p>Here is an invoice from the University of Waikato (that was charged to my Studnet Loan):  file:///Users/kelly/Documents/GitHub/kellyroe.github.io/writing/invoice.pdf</p>

                            <p>Things to note about that invoice:</p>

                            <p>(1)  I didn't apply to do a Philosophy Thesis with the University of Waikato in 2019, at all.  I applied to 120 points 1 EFT PHIL0800 MPhil Thesis with enrolment dates 05-03-2018 - 03-03-2019.  I wrote them a thesis in 2018 and submitted it in September 2018.  They refused to send it out.  October 2018.  They sent the MPhil out for 'doctoral examination'.  Then, in response to examiners reports:  January 2019.  They refused to send that out.  February 2019.  They refused to send that out.</p>

                            <p>(2).  120 points = 0.5 EFTS for PHILO800 Philosophy MPhil Thesis 2019.  </p>

                            <p>(3).  60 points = 0.5 EFTS for PHIL0800 Philosophy MPhil Thesis 2019 5 months of enrolment. </p>

                            <p>(3). 20 points = 0.1667 EFTS for PHIL0800 Philosophy MPhil Thesis 2019 2 months of enrolment.  </p>

                            <p>What does the Tertiary Education Commission say about how Universities are required to report their Stats if they want government funding and if they want to invoice to Student Loans?  They must report them 3 ways.  120 points = 1 EFT = 34 weeks of enrolment including the examination period.  It doesn't say that 120 points = 0.5 EFTS = 60 points = being detained indefinately under the zero fees scheme.  It doesn't say that you can enrol students in programmes of study that they never applied to be enrolled in.  Particularly when they have done the work for the qualification, already.  If you scroll through to page 3 you see that they say tuition feees are owing but will be paid by the NZ Government under 'PhD examination fee waiver (domestic).  I wasn't enrolled in a PhD.  THey had no business sending my 120 point MPhil thesis out for PhD examination in 2018.  They had no business double-billing 2 lots of PhD examination (one in 2018 and then another again in 2019) when I only applied to be enrolled in a 120 point 1 EFT MPhil Degree that should have been completed in time to have enrolled in a different progamme of study (Medicine) in 2019.  I didn't need my grades to be finalised because the MPhil is ungraded the grades were from my Honors Year.  They agreed to use my grades that had already been locked in (then proceeded to refuse to accept the GPA when calculated according to their algorithm) and refused to examine my thesis for the qualification I applied to be enrolled in.</p>

                            <p>This is a letter they got their lawyer to send me:  https://kellyroe.github.io/writing/fees.pdf  Focus on the part that says 'From the 1st July and during the examination period we will keep you fully enrolled under zero fees...'  What part of the zero fees scheme was to apply to graduate research students?  The TEC makes it clear that the enrolment period (for which fees are paid) includes study breaks and examination periods.</p>

                            <p>Neil Quigley (Vice Chancellor of the University of Waikato) does mathematics:</p>

                            <p>https://kellyroe.github.io/writing/squigley.pdf</p>

                            <p>External examiners are paid differently whether they are examining a Masters Thesis or a Doctoral Thesis.  I have the examiners packs that were sent to the examiners that assert this.  I don't know how much money was transferred from the University of Waikato into Caroline Mason's bank account: https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/arts/contact-us/people/carolyn-mason.html (she was one of the external examiners) to know whether she and the Canadian one were paid to examine a Doctoral or Masters thesis (twice)...  But they were provided with cover-pages for their reports that were headed 'doctoral examination'.  I mean to say whether they were paid to examine it as a masters or doctoral thesis the cover-page for their 2018 reports of the thesis made it clear that they were examinining it with respect to acceptability as a doctoral thesis.  Why?  Because no external examiner is going to say that 50,000 words is enough for a PhD.  And the Univesrity of Waikato wanted moooooooore mooooooney.</p>

                            <p>Take Quigley to China with you when you go over there with a trade delegation, Chris Hipkins.  Take him so he can be accountable for how he is billing the 'students'.  I think you will find that they are not keeping accurate records of student enrolments.  Forcing re-enrolment and more and more and more and more fees to be paid because Quigley is a f*cking psychopath.</p>

                            <p>How old is Caroline Mason ffs...  Is she over the age of 65 yet?  Time to retire Caroline.  Get the f*ck out.  Where is all your studnets research then, eh?  All the research outputs you've supervised to timely completion?  Yeah, right. </p>

                            <p>Is Kim Sterelny still on payroll at the Australian National University?  How old is he?  </p>

                            <p>How old was the former speaker of the house sent off to be diplomat of Ireland?</p>
                            
                            <p>How old was Justice Toogood?  Pulled out of retirement to hear Roe v University of Waikato and not see anything wrong with the way they are double billing for studnets, recording enrolments in programmes of study never applied for etc etc etc.</p>

                            <p>NZ was the only place that didn't seem to have any problems with China keeping people in prison camps in the name of training and education.  Can we think hypothetically?  IF this and that sort of thing is going on THEN is that okay?  New Zealand said:  Not any different from anything we are trying to do.  Doing in fact.</p>

                            <p>To be clear.  The US says that you need to have graduated from one of their approved medical schools within 5 years to apply for registration to practice in the US.  Auckland and Otago are currently listed as approved.  I informed them that those are the only 2 Medical Schools in NZ and they are not processing applications to enrol properly.  They are also not processing graduations properly.  E.g., Harlene Hayes was VC at Otago when they decided to withhold graduation from studnets who had internships signed off because they didn't want to pay them to work in the hospitals (when they could have them continue to pay the 'University') and when they did not want to allow them to get away (e.g., by passing USMLE examinations and having employment options overseas).  I asked them if I could sit the examinations without having gone to Medical School.  I can purchase study materials (USMLE books, World Question Bank, etc) and register if and only if I was found competent by their examination process.  They said 'no'.  Which shows you that they don't care about competency.  It's just a money making scummy scam.  I wonder if they even grade the thing properly, at all.  I guess the idea is that you pay money to go to Harvard or wherever because they will give you more direectly the answers that you need to spout in that particular year.  Not even trying to be fair,  hey.</p>

                            <p>Have to wait for various people to die before there will be a job for me, apparently.  They wouldn't have it any other way.  F*cking hurry up and die, then.  I'm sick and f*cking tired of waiting for you to die, then.  Now you want to say I'm too old to have a job at all.  While you are over 65 and still on payroll.  You are supposed to retire at 65.  Many of them have been on government payroll since 20 if not before.  More than 45 years of governmetn payroll and they were too f*cking stupid to plan for their retirement?  GET OUT!!!!!  F*CKING GET OUT!!!!!!!!  GET OUT!!!!!</p>

                            <p>What education and training system?  F*cking psychopaths.  GET OUT!!!!</p>

                            <p>Take the trade delegation to China and explain to them how much money they should pay NZ 'Universities' for education in this country when NZ 'Universities' don't acknowledge their own qualifications 5 years post-graduation.  They think that the value of an education is that it is obsolete 5 years post-graduation.  Factor that in to the cost of the qualification.  That the entire qualification wont be acknowledged even by them, in 5 years.  So say the people over the age of 65 who won't get out.  Busy trying to undermine the Universities entirely by replacing tertiary education curriculum contents with secondary contents with primary contents with no education and training system at all.  There isn't anything there.  </p>
