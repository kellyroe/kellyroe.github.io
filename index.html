 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">

                            <p>I thought Una Jagose was standing down from her position after she testified to the courts about her role in concealing evidence and destroying evidence and asking for those things to be done so as to prevent and prohibit justice for vitims of abuse in state care.  Wasn't she going to stand down over that?  Or did we decide that we valued her far more than any of the victims so they could die so that she can keep on keeping her payroll year after year after year after year after year.  How much does she cost the taxpayers, again?  Wah wah wah wah wah we don't have any money to pay out the victims of state care.  Wah wah wah.  We don't collect tax from the weathy wah wah wah we don't have any money.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>So she's going after some Hamilton Prosecutor.  Apparently. After re-appointing Justice Toogood back onto payroll from his retirement (because thats the process for appointing judges, we don't appoint new judges, we re-appoint old judges.  Nobody else can be judge until it's over Justice Toogoods dead body.  He'd have to die before there would be a job for anybody else.  She's not stopped her practicing her job -- apparently she doesn't have any concerns about the competence or ability of her to do her job -- she's objecting to her on cultural grounds, or something.  Nothing to do with her doing her job, but some other reason.  Seeing about having someone who is apparently competently doing their job removed from their postion because.. Well...  Because Una Jagose really doesn't seem to have any kind of handle or grip at all upon anything at all to do with what is just or what is fair.  How much money does she cost, again? What has to happen to her so that NZ can get a competent socilitor general.  One competent to appoint judges via proper process only.  One who doesn't go after people who are apparently actually doing their job.  One who doesn't order evidence to be destroyed in order to prevent and prohibit justice from being done.  </p>

                            <p>But this is upside down and back to front land.  Where Lord God Ashley Bloomfield is knighted for his role in unlawfully declaring the nation to be in lock-down and appointed to payroll as Professor (when he never applied to do PhD, never wrote one, and doesn't have any research output at all).  Upside down and back to front land.  Wah wah wah teh governmnet doesn't have any money.  Won't collect a capital gains tax.  Won't pay out the victims of abuse in state care.  Can NZ possibly go any f*cking slower?  Stupid-land.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>
