 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->

                            <article>

                                <p>'Dr' Ashley Bloomfield is 'Dr' in virtue of graduating from MBChB (Medicine).  The Univerities of New Zealand are giving the bulk of the training places to 18 and 19 year olds (they maintain they have the discretion to choose to do this and the Courts have upheld their freedom to do anything include disccriminate against applicants on basis of race or income or post-code or secondary school or disability).  Ashley Bloomfield did not apply to study for PhD.  He does not have PhD.  I don't think he tutored or did laboratory demonstrations.  I don't think he wrote research publications.  I don't think he did any teaching or any research.  I'm not entirely sure how he went from MBChB to a 1 or 2 year Masters Degree (or how many months of enrolment they recorded his research project as having taken) but he went from there to Wellington and worked his way up the Government as a civil servant.  
                                </p> 

                                <p>AUT is apparently wanting to fire people on staff because it says they aren't teaching or researching enough.  The problem isnt' that they aren't teching or researching enough to be made Professor...  They aren't teaching or researching enough to be employees of the University, at all.  Meanwhile, Ashley gets made Professor for all the teaching and research work that he does not do.  On the basis of no teaching experience and on teh basis of no publications, at all.</p> 

                                <p>Did they publically advertise the Professor position that they have given to him?  HOw many applications did they get for the position?  Was he really teh most qualfied applicant for that job?  Did they not receive a single application from anybody with a PhD?  Not a single application from anybody with publication?  Not a single application from anybody with any teaching experience?  Did they then re-advertise the job to make sure that international candidates knew we were looking for a Univesrity of AUckland Professor?  In case other countries are still handing out PhDs when we don't seem to want to do that anymore because we dont' have any jobs for our graduates because all our jobs to to people who never graduated.  What f*cking nonsense.</p>

                                <p>The High Court Judges have declared that there is nothing to stop the Universities of NZ from enrolling whoever they want for whatever arbitrary reasons they want.  That includes them throwing away applicaitons on the grounds that the applicant is a race they don't like or whatever.  Including if the applicant is the victim of abuse in state care and they think the applicant would make a better victim than a perpetrator).  And with that knowledge we are supposed to believe that Otago has become the most desirable location in the whole world for people to go to to get the cheapest Medical Education in the English Speaking World so they have more money left over to donate to the University in the hope of buying good-will or something, one can only suppose.  New Zealand of course the best place to do experimentation on infants since we recently just changed the laws so that nobody will be profescuted for wrongful death or murder involving anything to do with a foetus.  Also, nobody was ever prosecuted before.  So it doesn't actually matter what any of the laws are.</p>

                                <p>I used to think that I would donate my inheritance to a University.  To provide a scholarship to a future student.  But there aren't any universities, by the seems of it.  The scholarship money doesn't get to the kids, it gets stolen or taken by teh administration and mis-spent.  The University throws away applications on arbitrary grounds.  Refuses to supply applicatons so that certain people are the only game in town.  We didn't have anybody with a PhD or any teaching experience to make Professor.  How many applicants were there for the Professorship recently given to Ashley?  The lengths they have to go to in order to try and make it look like he's the only f*cking game in town.</p>

                                <p>Of course it's a joke.  The Universities don't want me donating anything at all to them.  They decided that they would just take everything from me until I wouldn't have anything left to them to take.  They would just take all my research work and give me no credit whatsoever at all. It was somehow going to be more lucrative for them to refuse to allow me to apply for scholarshihps, even (well, they could just take the scholarships for themselves that I applied for or to), they would take my research proposals and, well, may as well just swap out my name for theirs and take all of the money for that for them too.  Hey, I know, let's get her slaving for the courts, then.  SHe can be instructed to file and refile and refile and refile and refile so the Judges can assert and reassert and reassert the Unviersities power to do anything anything anything they like with complete and utter imunity.  They dont' have to follow the Eudcation and Training Act.  They don't have to follow the Bill of Rights.  They can just exterminate people all voluntary-like.  Round them up for their shots (vaccine or euthanasia it's all the same).  No people.  I can't see any people.  Can you?  They can't publically advertise training or employment.  They can't assess people on the basis of the merits with respect to the things they are supposed to be selecting for (with respect to their published selection criterion).  How is NOT HAVING A PHD PART OF THE SELECTION CRITERION FOR PROFESSOR?  What a f*cking farce.</p>

                                <p>The hierarchical people think that people are like chickens.  That is or means to say you spend your entire life peck peck peck peck pecking and the frienemy who is one place higher than you in the pecking order.  Then you peck that guy to death, or dismemberment.  Incapacitation.  That guy gives up the will to live.  So then you get to take that guys place and peck peck peck peck peck at your freienemy one above. Then they get the chickens all pecking aroudn in circles. The great circle-jerk or what have you.  Wasting time.  Well, now, here's a better idea.  You get a group of monkeys together and you all throw rocks at one of them.  You decide which one of them to eliminate.  So now it's about politicking getting everybody all motivated and inspired to throw rocks at one guy.  So now the guy could be teh top guy, even.  Because the mob.  Biggest mob wins or something like that.  Anyway.  The whole poitn or purpose is that the people don't udnerstand equality.  They don't want to live amongst equals.  They want to live amongst animals where everything is sooooooooooo competitive.  Sooooooooo competitive.  Sooooooooooo competitive.  And where you are justified in kick kick kick kick kicking down because they are all pecking up.  They are pecking at you..  They are your lackeys.  Your job is to weaken them and keep them kicked back and down.  So that they can't peck quite so hard at you.  What a wonderful way to spend our lives.  Right?  How..  Uh..  Motivating and inspiring...</p>

                                <p>Some people are bullied and excluded because they are disabled.  They appear different or are differnet in some way that makes other people feel uncomfortable. And when something makes you feel uncomfortble then some people respond to that by thinking the best thing they can do it eliminate it.  Remove it.  Remove the source of their uncomfort in that way.  Other people are bullied and excluded..  Because.  Just because.  Doesn't matter why.  Because others are getting away with it.  That makes them winners in the great competititon of life game, apparently.  The aim or the goal or the idea or the point is to incapacitate disable and elminate as many people as possible.  THe losers at or of life.  That's what that means.  I mean...  In a war environmetn if I pluck your eyes out then I win.  You lose.  If I cut your ears off and you can't hear then I win.  You lose.  If you can't walk and I can.  I win.  You lose.  If I can have it recorded that you are disabled then you have been incapacitated.  You lose.  I win.  The High Court has ruled that the Univerities of New Zealand can throw away applicatons to enrol for whatever reasons they like.  Now think about reasons. Including because they think that a person might speak out about abuse in state care (rather than wanting to partake in or of it).  INcluding because they think that people might have compassion or empathy for the weak rather than thinking that they most desire to exploit them.  INcludilng thinking that the heatlh system is about anything other than weakening sickening disabling incpacitaing and generally going aroudn declaring much of everybody else to be losers of the great life game. </p>

                                <p>The government seems to think that their primay purpose or point is in fact to declare war against the people.  I mean to say..  Ashley Bloomfield was the only person who applied to be Professor?  Really?  Was teh job even publically advertised?  How many other applicants were there?  HOw many applicants had their applications thrown away only because they were obviously more qualified and better suited to Professorship than he?  There is really no hint of 'try' so far as I can see...  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  I used to think that I would donate my inheritance to a University.  To a scholarsip of some variety.  Something like that.  But they are too corrupt.  Also, (actually part of the corruption) they don't need or want any donation whatsoever from me.  They decided that they would just take me for everything that I have completely totally and utterly so I'd have nothing to give.  I mean..  For how many years am I expected to work towards qualifications that I've done enough to have earned years and years and f*cking years ago?  Meanwhile people who didn't do the work for them get made Profesor?  They won't pay me for the work that I do.  Then they throw me to  be slave to the courts.  So they, now, can take everything I have.  Just take everything.  Take take take take take.  The courts just take.  Identify peopel to take and take and take and take from.  Persecute the victims (jump on the victim bandwagon of taking everything just taking everything just taking and taking and taking) and declaring over and over and over there is no justice.  There is no education . There is no healthcare.  There isn't anything here.  </p>

                                <p>They won't supply applications to enrol but even if they do they throw the applications away.  They won't process the applicaitons according to the merits  but even if they do they won't select the best person for the postion (when they have published criteiron as to how they are supposed to decide the best person -- they just won't do it).  They won't enrol or employ the best person (according to their published criterion).  They intentionally choose to pay and pay and pay people who don't have the willingness and / or ability to do the actual f*cking job descsritpion or to complete the actual f*cking progarmme of study.  They don't wnat it done, anyway.  The point is to get people working only to ensure it isn't ever done.  No justice.  No healthcare.  No supervising research.  No teaching curriculum contents.  And the main point or pupose is to get all the money to peple witout the willingness and ability (all and only those working towards the prevention and prohibition of anything at all programme) and to starve out anybod with teh actual willingness and / or ability.  There's nothing here.  There's nothing here.  There's nothing here.  </p>

                                <p>The Judge ruled that the governmetn doesn't need people to actually apply to programmes in order to record that they have actully been enrolled in programmes.  So, now, how many people are the govenrment going to enrol in the Right Honorable Sir Dr Ashley Bloomfield PhD MBChB MD JD BS qualification?  Headed by someone without a PhD who doesn't have any teaching experience or any research output?  HOw much money are they going to pay him each and every year to ensure that no teaching is to be done.  No research is to be done.  However many people will be identified as peopel who will have course fees invoiced to their studnet loan (endentured servants of the governmetn with debts only to be recorded against their name).  Not a university,  hey.  Not even trying to be. </p>
