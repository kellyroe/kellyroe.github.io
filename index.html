                        <div class="container">

                            
                            <p>
                                <a href="https://kellyroe.github.io/writing/realmecv.pdf">Chronological CV</a>
                                There is a link to my CV that I have presently under consideration for various things.
                             </p>

                             <p>When you look at how they won't graduate people you need to look at what the Dean of Research at Waikato referred to as 'exit qualifications'.  I mean to say they don't have any problems with graduation ceremonies or events for people who have already been enrolled in further study with the 'university'.  So, they will have graduation events for people at the end of the third year of a 3 year 'degree'.  Only if they are enrolled in their honors year.  Then they will have graduation events for people at the end of their fourth or honors year (to really boost the numbers in gowns) only if they are already enrolled in a masters or doctoral or further certificates.  It's only the 'exit qualifications' that they won't do.  It's time to die, you see, when you stop getting from them more and more and more money for re re re re re enrolment, more and more money from the government to keep them on less than minimum wage, then it's time for them to tresspass you from the 'university' and run you out of town.  Bully to death etc.  Have more babies, everyone, we need a new class of 3,000 medical students so that we can end up with zero medical graduates.  Year after year after year after year.  Bully each other to death, they do, it's sooooo competitive.  Then it's super easy to pick the weakened off, at the end, there.  They don't come back from their internships.  THey took jobs overseas.  Their social media postings always were indistinguishable from a computer programme and nothing has changed.  What medical doctors?  What lawyers, eh, Judith?  You going to do pro bono work, now, with the CAB etc talking to the migrant workers processing their claims of asylum etc?  Yeah, right.</p>

                             <p>Judith Collins make Queens Counsel?  Is that for all the work that she's done, over however many years, serving as a public prosecutor?  Must be.  Like how Shane Reti is registered to practice as a GP for all the work he does, in that capacity 1, or is that 3 weeks of every year.  He manages to see all the clients enrolled with him as their PHO in the 1-3 weeks.  Manages to write them an entire year's worth of opiate and amphetamine and anasthetics prescriptions.  An entire year's worth of referrals to specialists.  I'm sure.  Of course.  He's such a superman.  And Judith Collins is exactly what one would expect of a lawyer.  The professionalism, I mean to say, with the leaked information about individuals medical information.  She's exemplary.  I suppose nobody else applied for enrolment in Law, nobody else graduated.  Nobody else is registered to practice.  Nobody else is employed by the government to prosecute the governments crimes.  It's the University of Government, didn't you know? When the highest degrees and titles and honors and awards are handed out on an honorary basis with..  Are they imaginary pay-cheques then?  Apparently grades don't mean everything.  They don't mean anything at all when they are handed out to people who did not even do any of the work for them.  NZ doesn't have any professionals because they don't have an education system.  Justice Toogood proclaimed that it's slave prison detention camps.  People are being enrolled in 'tertiary' courses that they never applied to be enrolled in.  THey aren't getting the work out to be externally examined, at all.  There's nothing there.  There aren't any universities.  They don't want people reading (how the government refuses to follow the laws and the judiciary refuses to uphold them).  They don't want people viewing how the government pretends to keep accounts.  THey won't pay the workers.  It's really not rocket science.  Of course there isn't any rocket science in NZ.  There's nothing in NZ.  Taken over by psychopaths and there's nothing there.  Death camps.  There's nothing there. </p>

                             <p>I will try not to do  anything to break the links while I refresh the contents.  I am in the process of file re-formatting and reorganising my work. </p>

                             <p>I am not entirely sure what to do about revisions.  On the one hand it is tempting for me to do them.  On the other hand, nobody is paying me to do them.  How much is enough for a PhD?  For paid employment?  I guess you start by taking a careful look at the various people who, allegedly, or apparently, have PhD's and have paid employment.  See how much they did.  Maybe see how much they continue to do, post-graduation.  Have a think about their oral defences, as well.  Whether people can ask questions freely of them or whether they huddle in with a herd and don't even attend other people's talks at conference etc.</p>

                             Not sure what date to put on that.  2010?  2011?  2012?  The Australian National University has inserted the table of content into my student record notes as evidence they were supplied with the document that is of sufficient length for doctoral examination during a time in which I was enrolled as a doctoral candidate.  Maybe ask them when they intend to schedule the public oral defence?  Get them to pass the external examiners comments along to me so I can prepare for the oral defense?  Looking forward to it!  When do you think it might be?  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                               Does anybody enrolled in the ANU get reports from external examiners and hold a public defence?  Ever?  Any of them?  Any of them at all?  Any of them who are presently employed either at the ANU, or elsewhere in Australia?  Any of them who got paid employment overseas and visas, apparently dependent on their status as doctoral graduates?  (1)  How many years after their enrolment start date were they kept enrolled before their work went out for external exam?  (2)  How many years later did they get reports from examiners (did they get any)?  (3)  Where and when was their public oral defence scheduled?  (4)  Any atendees for that?  Is it a university -- or a prison, slave, or detention camp?  What Universities?
                         </p>

                                <p><a href="./publish/2013-rep.pdf">Roe, (2013).  A few small chunks for 2013.</a>
                                </p>

                                <p>Sterelny referred to the above as a `few small chunks' so I'm taking him to be authorative on that.  Maybe he was only focussed on the parts that referenced himself.</p>

                                 <p><a href="./publish/2018-rep-1.pdf">Roe, (2018).  Disability and equity for medicine and public health (September, 2018)</a>
                                </p>

                                <p>This was a 120 point 1 EFT 34 week (including the external examination process MPhil).  3 spiral bound copies were supplied to the Research School on 14 September 2018 and they still haven't send it out for external examination.</p>

                                  <p><a href="./publish/2018-rep-2.pdf">Roe, (2018).  Disability and equity for medicine and public health (October, 2018)</a>
                                </p>

                                <p>The University sent the MPhil out requesting `doctoral reports' from externals.  I don't know if externals were paid the amount associated with Masters or Doctoral examination but they were supplied with templates for doctoral examination only.</p>

                                <p><a href="./publish/2019-rep-1.pdf">Roe, (2019).  Disability and equity for medicine and public health (February, 2019)</a>
                                </p>

                                <p>This was the thesis I substantively updated in response to the `doctoral reports' of external examiners of my MPhil.  While they provided enough comments to turn the under 50,000 word 1 EFT MPhil into a 360 point 100,000 word PhD - that wasn't the programme that I applied to be enrolled in.  I even wrote a commentary for the examiners (the Dean said it would make it more likely to be accepted) - and the Dean refused to get the thesis and refused to get the comments to externals. </p>

                                <p>University of Auckland said that I wasn't eligible to start MBChB with Auckland in 2019 because I hadn't completed a qualification from a NZ University within the last 5 years.  That is not what the Education and Training Act says.  The law says I'm eligible because I'm a domestic adult who has attained the age of 20 years.  The above link was a 120 point 1 EFT MPhil completed in the 34 weeks that the TEC says is the normal amount of time to be associated with that qualification.  NZ is not even trying to keep Universities.  We see the lengths they go to to refuse to enrol eligible candidates into their Medical School.  Sorry, their prison slave detention camp.  Where Medical studnets go to die.  Nobody actually graduates from that programme of study.  Right?  Where do the medical graduates go?  They go off in Australian submarines never to be heard from again?  Where are all the doctors?  What Universities?  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p><a href="./publish/2018-rep-2.pdf">Roe, (2019).  Disability and equity for medicine and public health (June, 2019)</a>
                                </p>

                                <p>I get a letter that is pretty obviously extortion.  Saying I am to be kept re-enrolled for 20 points (that more money will be invoiced to my student loan for re-enrolment) and then I am to be detained indefinately under the zero fee scheme (which is for first year studnets and not graduates).  You can follow the legal action over on the tab for that.  NZ is not even trying to be rule by law.  Justice Toogood was reappointend from retirement.  He is past the compulsory age of retirement for judges.  That means to say that after 45 +++ years of government payroll he's still not financially independent from all the government handouts.  We don't have any new judges to appoint, one can only suppose, because nobody graduates from law school.  What Universities?  There is nothing there.</p>

                                <p>The judges refuse to process the cases that were filed.  The change the issue from the one that was filed into something to delay delay delay confuse obstruct prohibit prevent deny.  They refuse to accept evidence presented to them.  THey make false assertions in their judgements.  They ignore half the laws.  There is nothing there.  Not a developed country, at all.  I really don't see that Australia is even trying to be any different.</p>

                                <p>I wrote to the ANU and they said they would not do anything unless I lodged a formal complaint via formal process.  I said I would prefer to sort things out informally and they declined.  I said I wanted to lodge a formal complaint, then.  They then refuse to acknowledge that anything I supply to them is in fact a formal complaint.  There is nothing there.  They don't have a University.  There is nothing there.</p>

                                <p>The manufacture of disease.  Animal cells don't really grow in dishes.  So they try and cause cancers with radiation and so on, trying to get the cells to grow so they can grow them in dishes.  But they don't grow very well in dishes.  So you get samples from cells and tumors etc etc and do your best to get them to grow in dishes.  Then you implant them into whoever you can find and see what you get growing.  Like the tobacco mosaic virus.  Collect it from a plant, grow it in the lab, then put it into another plant and see the new plant get the same sickness.  The manufacture of sickness.  How many people can we kill today?  It's soooooo hostile and it's sooooo competitive!  Nobody need apply!  It's soooo hostile and it's soooo competitive they get thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of medical student every year it's so competitive!  Oh my!  And they die before they'll be graduated.  I'm sure.  So the daughter of the Vice Chancellor can get busy busy busy seeing how many aboriginals she can kill today.  Or similar.  What a f*cking farce of a hoax of a joke of a f*cking scummy scam.  Where is my PhD ffs?  F*cking psychopaths.</p>
