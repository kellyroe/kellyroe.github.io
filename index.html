                                <p>Apparently the New Zealand Government is presently working on the development of some kind of National Curriculum Standard by which they mean to indicate to certain people's children that they have been hand-picked to go to University so they can become Government Employees in the Health, Education, Law kinds of sectors, or whether they are deemed illiterate and innumerate such that nobody will process any of the documentation they provide about how the New Zealand Government is unlawfully keeping people detained or enslaved refusing to pay them and unlawfully recording levels of debt against their name.  That is what that means -- right?  Ministry of Education employees will inform studnets (on the basis of their parental post-code and Secondary School attended, and race, and whatever disability information they have etc etc etc) whether the student has been hand-picked by them as most likely to be most rape-y at law camp etc etc to be made judge, one day.  Pulled out of retirement (after 40++ years of Government Payroll) to further the cause of oppression against the people etc.
                                </p>

                                <p>John Matthewson asked me, at one point, how it was that I had done work on so many different things during my candidature at the ANU.  I said that I wasn't sure, really, I just kept working, and Kim Sterelny (my supervisor) just kept basically ignoring the work that I had done, not really accepting it, so I ended up working across a range of different things.  Just sort of starting a new angle or whatever.  I remember John Matthewson telling me, in return, that it did not matter who did the work, at all, it was all about who is credited as having done the work.  I suppose what I take from the situation now is that the reason why I am not being credited as having done the work is because they decided they would rather keep me as hostage or slave (keep working, keep working, keep working, and when you are done working then f*ck off and die for all we care) and give my work to others for them to receive the credit for it.  I suppose that makes the very very best sense of the reluctance of them to acknowledge me as the author and their reluctance to credit me with the work that was done.  Paul Griffiths wrote about how the point of the social emotions is to control people.  You use guilt and shame and so on to have people comply with what you want.  People who have conscience are most susceptible to being guilted and shamed into doing whatever it is that you want.  You accuse them of not having a social conscience, not being a team player, and so on.  To get them to comply with your wishes.  Just keep working, just keep working.  It's garbage garbage garbage you are garbage garbage garbage keep working.  Just keep working.  Just hand over all of your stuff.  Just keep working handing over all of your stuff.  Hey, why not write a complaint, then?  Hey, why not revise and resubmit your complaint then?  Hey just keep working just keep complaining.  Hey write another complaint.  Just keep complaining.  
                                </p>

                                <p>I don't know who got credit for my work, exactly.  John Matthewson used to say that 'ideas are cheap.  It doesn't matter where you get your ideas from or who has the ideas it is all about who gets credit for having written up the ideas'.  I used to write my conference presentation talks as written with powerpoint slides to accompany.  I would print off the written talk and the powerpoint presentation (sometimes, othertimes I'd just print off the powerpoint presentation) and I would distribute that at conference with my work email so that people would contact me about it, or whatever.  So they could reference me, I guess.  I would also leave spares in rooms so that people could find it and take a look even if they had not atteneded the talk themselves.  I've put that stuff up on this website, now.  So you can understand that many people had access to my work even when it had not been formally published in the journals under my name.  
                                </p>

                                <p>I guess I'm supposed to 'lie flat' now.  By which they mean curl up and die.  Others have profiteered from having me do all of this work without my being credited for it.  They have taken the research funding and the jobs for themselves.  And they all rightly belong to Kim Sterelny.  Right?  He is the God of Philosophy in Australasia.  The only person who decides who gets credit and recognition and paycheck.  Right?  And the answer to that is who likes to socialise with Sterelny and stroke his ego and spend their time pandering to him.  I suppose.  Because without those things...  Well, check his ANU email outbox for all the supervision he offered me.  He was paid by the French Government?  The Jean Nicod Prize?  He wrote about 'The Evolved Apprentice' which was, effectively, how you keep people as slaves.  You don't teach them anything.  You don't acknowledge anything they do.  You refuse to train the next generation.  You refuse to acknowledge anything they do.  You take their outputs and claim it as your own else you give it to people who don't have the capacity (willingness or ability) to do anything.  You you you you you.  Quite the life for you.  
                                </p>

                                <p>I don't entirely understand the why.  Perhaps it is supposed to motivate and inspire people to spend a few hundred thousand US dollars on a University education.  By undermining the value of the Australasian  system.  Since the Australasian system is not properly handling applications to enrol, progressions, is not supervising people properly and (failing that) is not getting out of their way and getting their work to externals in a timely fashion to allow them to be signed off as having completed.  Sterelny chooses, apparently.  Because it's all about the parties, or some such.  There isn't any Philosophy of Mind in Australasia, anymore.  Guess you will need to pay the US to get to study Philosophy.  If you want to write up narratives of the experimental work such as that done my Marc Hauser (who apparently lost his lab for his role in students falsifying their data etc) then you might want to study in Australasia.  That's what Australasia wants to be.  Else that's what Australasian Government has decided to do.  To sell out the people.  There's nothing here...  Party party party.  Let's have a party.  Let's figure how to make the tools of oppression even more perverted (health, education, law)...
                                </p>

                                <p>The strange thing, to me, is that people seem to lack the cognitive capacity to think that one day it will come down to them and their conscience.  I mean to say, people die alone, in fact.  It isn't something that you share.  But biggest mob of bullies always wins -- right?  It's all about huddling in with the biggest herd.  Right?  That's what morality means in Australasia.  It's about compliance with government directive to sacrifice yourself for them.  Of course.  Clearly.  It's all about you sacrificing yourself so the people who take take take take take the most from everybody else can have more and more and more.  That seems right.  Allllll of the research funding for 1 or 2 or 3 people who don't appaear to have the willingness and / or ability to do much of any work in the actual field. They can ensure the prevention and prohibition of anything in the field.  Because all fields are the samey samey same same.  Taking all of the stuff from the people (keeping them as poorly and oppressed as you can get away with) and just sort of living as long as you can before people take hammers to the back of your head because that appears to be the only sort of justice that there is in these parts.  By design.  Quite.  Quite the lesson to everyone on the world stage, I suppose.  Do what the Northern Hemisphere Governments tell you when they tell you becuase they tell you else you will be deported to the Borderlalnds of Australasia.  Not even trying a little bit to even pretend to be rule by law, at all.  No functioing education, health, or judicial system.  Nothing to see.  Nothign nothing nothing at all.
                                </p>

                                <p>It does not matter, at all, what the laws in New Zealand or Australia are -- for the simple reason that the Judges will not uphold the laws.  By Judges I mean to say 'judges'.  If you look into the process that was (or was not followed) when it came to their appointment.  What they have been reappointed to do, in other words.  Apparently 40  years of being on Government Payroll as Government Prosecutor and as Judge is not enough for some people.  They need to be hauled out of retirement after a lifetime of Government Employment then kept employed so as to ensure that certain other people never ever ever ever ever have jobs.  All of the employment and all of the Government Payroll for them.  Send a generation or two of people off to die because..  Because you are getting away with it, I suppose.  Because Australasia doesn't need to develop a vaccine or put a satellite in space.  It can simply free-ride off of the other Governments who will pay people willing and able to do things like that.  It can simply choose to function as an unlawful detention camp or an unlawful slave camp.  Refusing to enrol, progress through, sign off on completion of training.  Refusing to publically advertise Government jobs, refusing to acknowledge Australasian Qualifications, even.  Simply refuse to do any of the things that the Statutory Laws say the Government jobs are.  For example, Chris Whelan with the Statutory Function of Upholding the Quality and Integrity of NZ Univeristy Qualifications by ensuring that we have whistleblower protection laws so as to ensure that our Education and Training System doesn't degenerate or disintegrate into a slave or detention camp.  The Tertiary Education Commission having the Statutory function of ensuring that qualifications are 'right sized'  so that a 3 year Degree does not equate to a lifetime of labor for the Univeristy with no pay.  The people employed by the Government to ensure the Quality of New Zealand University Qualifications think that their job is to ensure that the people of New Zealand are kept as hostages or slaves.  So that certain other people can have 2x or 3x or 10x the employment and payroll of everybody else.  Because of all the work that they do ensuring that the pedophiles and wrongful deathbringers are preferentially hired onto Government Payroll to be teachers and doctors and lawyers...  There's nothing here.  Read the judgements from the Supreme Court for yourself.  Does that seem, to you, like the judgements of a functioning Judiciary?  Does it look like there is even a teeny tiny little bit of 'try'?  The function of Psychiatry is the same as the function of Education and Law and the same as the function of everything else...  It is simply or merely a tool that the Government uses against the people in order to keep the people oppressed.  That's why it does not matter what you are 'deployed' into.  All jobs have the same end or goal. The keeping of as many people as badly as possible.  That really makes the very best sense of what you see in New Zealand and indeed in Australasia.  The choices that the Government Departments make (they refuse to use internal process to uphold justice and fairness and to right their wrongs).  They choose to use it to delay only.  They have been taken over by psychopaths, in fact.  There is nothing there.

                                <p>We are apparently supposed to believe that this guy has mad skillz such that he was able to forge a working barcode on a University of Auckland Student Identification Card. 

                                https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/middlemore-hospital-impostor-doctor-pleads-guilty-to-forging-document/JCAC2D3J3SJJRN63P2H4PC2RKQ/ 



                                  No?  They didn't have Student Identification Barcode Scanners in the Cadavar Dissection Lab.  When I was at Auckland they were scanning student barcodes on LECTURE THEATRES and ALL LABORATORIES.  I mean, you can't observe water, at the University of Auckland, without a working barcode.  Trust me, they are ensuring that you have paid your fees (and then some) in order for you to even be allowed on campus.  We are supposed to  believe he forged himself a Student Identification Number (present on the student id) and the Student Idenficiation Number that he forged for  himself on his Student Identification Card happened to match a Student Identification Number on the Roll for that class.  How many students is it to a Cadaver?  Is it 6 these days?  The group did not notice that their group had an extra student in it?  The tutor did not notice?  I mean, it defies credibility and it defies plausibility.  The most likely explanation is that this guy said or did something the Univesrity Administration or Governmetn did not like so they have decided to imprison him (like Brian Tamaki).  It isn't plausible, at all, that he fake himself a working Identification Card student number.  I think anybody who has done first year Health Science at the University of Auckland will know full well that this story defies credability.  What did he say or do?  He told someone with fibrosis of the lung that they needed to get an imaging scan.  What a crime.  We don't have radiologists, you see.  Apparently the Government was paying the radiation oncology people (radiate people on instructions from management?) thinking that they were Medical Doctors and thinking that they were Radiologists.  That sort of defies credability, also, honestly.
                                </p>

                                <p>I find it funny (strange, not funny haha) that the Dean of the School of Research, University of Waikato would instruct me to look deeply into her eyes and..  What?  Beg and plead for her to send my thesis out to external examiners...  Like she is paid to do...  To take the thesis from the student and post it out to the external examiners with instructions for them to examine it, in accordance with University regulations, for the Degree the student had applied, by the deadline, to be enrolled in...  She wants me to look her in the eyes, apparently, and say anything anything anything anything anything anything anything...  That will suitably motivate and incentivise her do, uh...  Do the f*cking job, for which she is paid.  I said to her 'is that what you want from your Medical Doctors?  You want them to look you in the eyes and say anything anything anything anything anything...'  Apparently so.  That is the standard or quality of healthcare that she wants, that she desires, for herself.  Not only herself -- but for everybody else.  Apparently the University of Waikato wants a Medical Training Programme so that the University administration can teach the students a little lesson or two in saying or doing anything anything anything anything anything the University Administration says...  The Waikato Hostpial is about the biggest Hostpial in Australasia.  They (for the most part) refuse to employ NZ trained Medical Doctors because, uh, there aren't any.  They find that people from developing nations overseas are more inclined to do anything anything anything the administration says (without pay). Go figure.
                                </p>

                            <p>The alliance between North America (USA and Canada) England (UK) and Australasia was, I thought, one that was based on things like democracy and rule by law.  Australasia refuses to be rule by law, however, things are too corrupt in these parts.  The Australasian Government seems to be choosing to keep a series or system of detention camps where the Justice, Education, and Health systems are used as tools of oppression against the people.  This website documents how the Tertiary Education System of Australasia refuses to train workers, refuses to sign off on completion of the training, refuses to grant qualifications to all (and only) the people who have meet requirements for the qualification, refuses to follow fair selection processes or their own published regulations when it comes to selecting which studnets to enrol, refuses to get supervised work out to external examiners in  timely fashion.  The Universities think their job is to keep detention camps where the studnets pay the University and / or the Government pays the University for detaining the student.  This feeds in to how the Judiciary refuses to uphold the laws.  The Judiciary seems to function as a tool of oppression against the people.  The Judicial Review page shows how the appointed judges (or judges pulled out of retirement who weren't even appointed properly) refuse to uphold justice.  They deny half the laws.  They deny the evidnece that has been put before them.  I have also documented how the Health System also is a tool against the people.  They are not processing applications to medicine properly.  They are not signing off on completion of training.  They put the Medical Students to work passing themselves off as Junior Doctors or Training Specialists or Consultant Specialists when they have not met requirements or when they have met requirements they deny them the qualifications and the training places and the supervision and the pay checks.  They have people kept in conditions of torture in the name of 'prisons' and 'psychiatric detention' and 'education schooling' and 'aged care' and it is just a system of detention camps up and down the land.  The Governments won't pay for the provision of social services (won't pay people to be doctors, teachers, lawyers, judges) and the like.  Not unless they are punative bullies and abusers.  Brian Tamaki gets locked up in Mt Eden because they don't want to hear how they are keeping detention camps.  Dr Leeks get to be placed in charge of selection, training, and sign off on Psychiatrists in New Zealand and Australia.  What you have to do in order to get a reference to be employed for a 'Social Services' job in Education, Health, Justice, in Austalasia.  There isn't anything here...  
                            </p>

                            <p>I have lodged a complaint with the Vice Chancellor of the Australian National University about them not processing applications to enrol properly (they say they decline my application on grounds they refuse to accept that anything on my writing page constitutes a 'writing sample' and they say that they do not have anybody willing or able to supervise research at that University).  The Vice Chancellor instructs me to re-write my complaint again and again (to 2 different Deans) and they say that I need to re-write my complaint again and again and again and again...  They simply refuse to acknowledge that they have received any complaints.  This is what Chris Whelan of the New Zealand Vice Chancellor's Committee was appointed to do.  When he isn't  blackbirding for student slaves in Vietnam or Brazil or Malaysia he is writing how he has recived precisely no complaints of wrongdoing about any of the Universities of New Zealand.  When AUT chooses to enrol a 14 year old girl in a Finance Degree (when 16 is the minimum age for University enrolment and when the Education Act states that Domestic Adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible to be enrolled in programmes they have applied to --  but the Universities withhold applications and choose to use discretion they believe they have to enrol teenagers).  When there are media reports of studnets claiming to have been sexually abused or used by supervisors before being deported without their qualifications (with or without a period of being drugged and detained in teh name of psychiatry services) Chris Whelan, apparently, has received no complaints.  When at least 1 person is found to be enrolled in the University, paying fees to the University, paying accommodation costs to the University -- while being dead for over 1 month.  Chris Whelan has recived no complaints at all about any of the New Zealand Universities.  Except for mine.  And the Judge pulled out of retirement to see no wrong writes that Chris Whelan would be behaving unlawfully if he performed his statutory function and actually Chris Whelan was appointed only to ensure that New Zealand would achieve 'lowest rate of perceived corruption' by being so corrupt as to pay him more than $200,000 per year to write only how he has never received a single complaint about wrongdoing from any of the Universities of New Zealand.  Where are all the theses?  For all teh studnets that the Unviersities of New Zealand say they have enrolled in graduate studnet research qualifications?  Where are they, then?  The Edcuation Act states that research is required to be the primary function of Universities.  Where is all the research, then?  Where is the research output of the studnets and the faculty?  Where are the journals?  Where are the books?  Where are the PhD theses and the enrolment dates associated with the production of the documents?  A PhD is supposed to take 3 years (extendible to 4 because it could take up to 1 year for the external examination process to work through).  Australasia seems only interested in keeping people unlawfully detained -- many of them won't get their PhD's until or unless they are literally dead so the Governmetn will never pay them.  Worse, many of them won't get their undergraduate Degrees until they are literally dead.  Worse, look at the people the Government chooses to acknowledge.  Dr Leeks gets hand-picked to select and train and graduate people as Psychiatrists.  To keep the instititions where we can put people when it looks like they have the willingness and ability to get their f*cking work done in a timely fashion.  Australasia cannot claim to have Universities.  Hospitals.  Judiciary.  There's nothing here.
                            </p>

                            <p>The Australian National University is not willing and / or able to supervise graduate research in philosophy.  They tell me they did not receive my research proposal (for any topic) from me, but there is no supervision available in the Philosophy Programme for 2022.  So, I suppose they didn't have any Philosophy students starting their PhD in 2022.  Else, they intend to refuse to provide supervision to those students.  They are done pretending to offer supervision to me.  Time to scammy scam some younger ones.  They like 'em young for the party party parties, you see.  I provided a research proposal to my former supervisor (who previously judged my work to be very good and expressed willingness to supervise me on a topic of his choosing) but they don't acknowledge the research proposal and he refuses to be a referee.  What kind of `employer' or `supervisor' refuses to write their employee or student a reference?  One that doesn't want to pay them and (more importantly) doesn't want anybody else to pay them either.  I think you have to be a violent sexual offender to get a reference, these days.   
                            </p>

                            <p>The writing page shows a 100,000 words + thesis that I provided to my supervisor, Kim Sterelny on the topic of his choosing.  More than 10 years ago...  He still hasn't given me any concrete comments on it as to what I need to do before I should get it to the external examiners.  He hasn't told me that he has read it, yet.  He also hasn't told me that if I want to get a thesis to externals then it is despite him or in spite of him and not at all because of him.  Does it look to you like he helped me with the thesis?  He chose the topic for me.  The evolutionary aspect to cognitive breakdown.  I didn't really see how viewing the phenemonon as evolutionary (or as a matter of breakdown) was particularly useful or helpful.  But it was a topic of his choosing.  A topic he was apparently willing to supervise me on.  So, where is evidence of his helping, then?  Does it look like a thesis that was produced under Sterelny's supervision?  What do they pay him for?  All the teaching that he does?  No?  Waiting on you, Sterelny.  Any time you are ready to unpack your stuff and get to work. The job for which you are paid.  My ANU student records are full of people in the Philosophy Programme saying that they should get more money from the government to keep me enrolled as student.  They say that my progress as student is just fine.  Nearly a full draft.  A full draft.  They expect me to submit by a certain date.  But they never get the work that I have given them to the examiners and there won't be evience of them having helped me with it in their email outboxes.
                            </p>

                            <p>Here is a question for you.  Is a student supposed to write the thesis and then softbind the thesis and then submit the thesis for external examination to a timeline.  For example, if it is reasonable to expect to take 1 year for external examination (3 months followed by 6 months changes followed by 3 months external examination for a total of 12 months of examination) then submitting a 3 year PhD thesis at the end of the second year would be the way to go.  Or, is the student supposed to work to a timeline set by their supervisor where their supervisor tells them when they are ready to submit the thesis?  Are you supposed to get your supervisor nice and drunk and get them to sign off on your submission date in that way 'by agreement'?  How is it supposed to go, exactly?  What if your supervisor just says 'keeeeeeep working'?  
                            </p>

                            <p>Supervisors have (one would suppose of a premier research university like the Australian National University) had experience with supervising before.  So they have supervised PhD students before.  So they have some idea of how long various things take and some idea of a realistic timeline to completion.  But the PhD student has, typically, standardly usually, not written or worked on or submitted a PhD before.  Who is being employed to  help who?  Or is the job to prevent and prohibit and obstruct.  Maybe the student only gets their PhD when they kill their supervisor.  Maybe that is the idea.  Because it's soooooooooo competitive.  The supervisors go gunning for their students.  That's the nature of the competition.  Divide and conquer.  Here are the special students (set up as targets only to be hated by the other students).  Create dissent.  Division.  All very...  Motivational and inspirational.  Don't you want to join them?  Party party party.  There's nothing wrong with a good party...  But there is something wrong with being expected to party with your boss or your supervisor partiuclarly when they are not being professional with their professional duties or obligations when it comes to processing or progressing or assessing or helping you improve your work performance.  Telling you timeline information.  Who wants to party party party with Des?  18 year old applicants to medicine?  I'm sure there is a brilliant 14 year old out there who will do anything anything anything anything it's sooooooo competitive.  That is the concern about the party party party situation.  And that is the nature of the competition.  It must be soooooooo competitive such that they will do anything anything anything anything anything.  Just following orders, you see.  Anything anything anything.
                            </p>

                            <p>No?  Well..  Leave then.  Just drop all of your stuff.  Just  hand it over.  Give it to us.  Then turn and walk away.  Or curl up and die.  Whatever.  Thanks for playing.

                            Chloe says that education is a poverty trap -- but she doesn't know what education is.  Education is not a poverty trap.  Education is not a social mobiliser, either.  Education is learning about the world.  Teacher and supervisors are supposed to help the students.  They are supposed to have more knowledge and more experience then them so that they are in the position (knowledge-wise) to help them.  They are supposed to have the motivation and desire to help them.  They are paid to help them.  We don't have education in New Zealand.  We won't pay people to do that.  We pay people to prevent and prohibit people with the willingness and ability to do the job from doing the job.  We have a system of slave or prison or detention camps with the aim or goal of preventing and prohibiting social mobility.  We don't have an education system.  If you learn to read, write, do arithmetic.  Do calculus.  Learn Medicine.  It's all despite of or in spite of our 'education' institutions.  There's nothing there.  There's nobody home.  They wouldn't pay anybody to do the actual job.  The actual work.  There's just a bunch of people trying to keep slaves detained indefinately while teaching them nothing and not allowing them to do any work to the best of their ability to prevent and prohibit and obstruct that too.  It's soooo competitive.  The slaves will do anything anything anything.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            They won't pay anyone to work clinical jobs.  You pay the university or the polytech training system (they are still working on setting it up) so that the slave worker students will be put to work and the slave worker students will pay the university they will pay the university they will pay the university they will pay.  They will never stop paying.  They will never stop paying the university.  And the university (or the polytech) will put them to work in the name of their training programme.  And not write them references for the work that they have done.  Will bully them and tell them that they are incompetent and inept and they don't know anything.  Will say that this one or that one is special (so the other ones will turn against them because it's soooooooooooo competitive).  And they won't pay the doctors or the nurses or the teachers or the sterile supply technicians or anybody anybody anybody at all.  Unless you want to be one of them.  Of course.  Don't you want to be one of them?  Ensuring that there aren't any teachers or doctors or nurses or sterile supply tecnicians.  No lawyers.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing at all.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            We do pay high taxes in New Zealand.  It has been with the expectation of social services.  But the Government will not pay people to provide social services.  They won't pay the teachers or the doctors or the nurses or the sterile supply technicians.  You pay the university or the polytech system.  They refuse to sign off on your workplace internship completion.  They say you have to keep working your internship just keep doing your internship.  Just keep paying the university and also doing the work you pay your employer.  Didn't you know?  That's what work is or what work means.  You pay the university because they are your employer.  You are a student and whistleblower protections don't apply to students because they are not employers there are no employment laws for the slaves that are detained by the universities and training system that makes people pay only.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The government wants people to comply in this, that, and the other respect.  To sign off that this, that, and the other building is safe (e.g., not an earthquake risk, not a fire hazard) so that insurance companies will bear at least some of the cost of the rebuild.  And the like.  The government wants people to do what they are told when they are told because they are told.  The judges.  I would suppose.  Brian Tamaki needs to be in Mt Eden but Dr Leeks needs to go train some more students in Melbourne.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            All of the power and none of the accountability.  Nobody can function.  One of the most under-developed economies in the world.  Corruption.  They won't pay the workers.  And where does all the money go, then?  Who is getting all the money on the payroll?  People who refuse to perform their statutory functions.  Chris Whelan, still.  Refusing to process or progress any complaints of serious wrong-doing against the Universities of New Zealand.  He won't do it.  Will not do it.  I was confused a bit because OIA request from me said that he did not fly anywhere on the taxpayers dime.  But I was sure he was off blackbirding for studnets very regularly in South America and Vietnam and the like.  I suppose those trips are unrelated.  Do do remember reading abuot a...  14 year old finance graduate from AUT...  I suppose the 'minimum age' laws on Tertiary Education (16 since that is the age for consent and party party party we all know how you gotta love 'dem parties with the admin in order to have the possibility of a place at all).  I thought that was why the Auckland VC's University provided house had rooms for a basement-slave.  Party party party.  It's soooooooo competitive.  The kiddies will do anything anything anything anything anything.  Right?  That's the nature of the competition and why it is that the people with power are determined to make everything a great competition.
                            </p>


                            <p>The Tertiary Education Commission defines a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  
                            <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a>.  The writing tab shows that the University acknowledged having received my application to enrol in a 120 point MPhil with 05 March 2018 start date by their prescribed deadline.  The TEC approved the qualification as being 'right sized'.  They have the statutory function of approving qualifications and checking that the enrolment period (34 weeks) matches the FTE EFTS (1) also the points value (120).  But the University of Waikato is keeping records showing that they are not billing students in this manner, at all.  They have had every opportunity to correct their records and they refuse.  They instructed me to take them to court if I had a problem with their practices.  The courts have, thus far, refused to uphold justice.  International and domestic community need to be warned that they are lacking in honesty and integrity.  They are interested in closing ranks around their wrongs.  New Zealand isn't lacking skilled workforce or labor, at all.  New Zealand is a nasty little despot where the people with power refuse to allow other people to function.  Hostages.
                            </p>


                            <p>Here is how much the Inland Revenue now says I owe the New Zealand Government for my 'Education' and 'Training' that are not acknowledged because New Zealand qualifications apparently expire 5 years post-graduation (well, not the Judges law degrees, apparently, but my qualifications have expired): 
                            <a href="judicial-review/ird-shot.pdf" target="_self"> $104,663.</a>  You can see, then, that New Zealand does not appear to have functioning Universities, they appear to have detention or forced labor camps.  They won't progress or process academic work (particularly research).  They refuse to get official documents (theses submitted for examination) to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit external examiners signing off on qualification completions.  There is no skilled labor workforce, in New Zealand, because New Zealand has a series or system of forced labor detention camps only.  You pay the University you pay the University you pay the University you pay the University.  Maybe they put you to work as an actor playing the part of a skilled professional.  Then, when you are done paying them, your qualifications are withheld.

                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  They aren't progressing the filings. They are refusing to supply applications, refusing to process applications on their academic merits.  Apparently it isn't a matter of public interest how they pick and choose people to pass themsleves off as 'doctors' in our hospitals.
                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  Demanding me to pay more and more and more money to the courts else they force all my cases aborted, or abandoned.  <a href="judicial-review/sc-eyes.pdf" target="_self"> Here is the Judgement of the Supreme Court that I am attempting to appeal on the grounds that it is manifestly grotesquely unjust. </a>  It is like they have their eyes poked out.  Our highest court does not seem to have the conception of justice, at all.  It was the courts decision to delay Roe v University of Waikato proceedings until AFTER Roe v NZVCC and also until AFTER Roe v University of Auckland.  The Judge for Roe v NZVCC made all kinds of pronouncement in his judgment on the matter of Roe v University of Waikato.  That is to say instead of judging the issue he was supposed to be judging (the inaction of Chris Whelan in his capacity as CE of the NZVCC) he thought he would weigh in on whether or not I had done enough for completion of the MPhil Degree.  Clearly that is a matter of the Judge of a different case to decide!

                             <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  The Australian Constitution clearly names New Zealand as a state of Australia.  They say that they don't have to honor the constitution because New Zealand officials did not turn up to various things and they did not consent.  I don't know why Australia would care about consent in that instance.  Did they care about the consent of the Aboriginal people of Australia?  Did they care about consent of people to be immunised or subject to medical treatments or experimentation?  If they want to change the constitution then there is a process for it to be changed.  I think it involves a vote.  But New Zealanders don't get to vote so the Australian Government clearly does not care whether or not the people of New Zealand consent.  New Zealand functions as a detention camp of Australia.  But then, Australia still seems to govern like it is a detention camp of the Northern Hemisphere, so...

                            <p>Una Jagose doesn't seem to have the job of instructing Crown Law to prosecute corruption within New Zealand Universities, or within the Judiciary (where judges refuse to accept evidence and where the supreme court punishes people for bringing injustices before the courts).  I suppose that is why they pay her more than half a million dollars to do that job.  They pay her to ensure the job is not done by anyone.  Not by her and not by anybody else.  The fact she is in the job prevents and prohibits the job being filled  by anyone with the willingness and ability to do the job.  It seems there is no evidence that they will accept that would attest to corruption.  None of the invoicing information that I provided (e.g., 0.5 EFTS = 120 points = 60 points = indefinate enrolment).  New Zealand does not appear to have a functioning judiciary.    <p> <a href="judicial-review/crown-law.pdf" target="_self"> Blow off response. </a>

It all starts to sound confusing, doesn't it.  The gaslighting garbage output nonsense nonsene nonsense from the courts.  Denying the evidence.  Refusing to acknowledge the half of the laws that speak to the duties and responsiblities and actual job descriptions of the various government departments (e.g, the NZVCC and various of the Universities).

                            <p>Australia now seems to have a case of the 'meeeeeeee toooooooooos'.  The 'metoo' in this part of the world is when the leadership sees a practice that is more depraved and deprivation inducing than the ones they currently have and they aspire to go even lower than lower than low.  They get all motivated and inspired at just how bad things can be..  And nothing will happen.  Right?  There will be no consequences.  Right?  Because it's hell on earth.  Right?  All the work that they do to bring it to  be.  Sooooooooooo competitive.  No education.  No justice.  No meaning.  No value.  Nothing.  Just a bunch of zombies following orders.  Which is fine.  No conscience.  When I grow up I want to be a...  Sophist.  No?  Psychopath?  Wrongful deathbringer?  Pedophile in the schools?  Sooooooo competitive...
                            </p>

                            <p>I don't see the pretty 14 year old girls turning up to play 'flight attendant' in the 'job fairs'.  But we see the face of unemployment, in NZ.  Oooooh no, the people turning up for the job fares already have jobs.  They are just looking for better offers.  And the people paid to do the deciding, well they don't see 14 year old girls to abuse.  So...  Bring on the cheap migrant slaves.  C'mon other countries.  You gotta have pretty young things you want to (effectively) sentance to death.  Right?  We will give them a 'job' in NZ.  Renowned the world over for fair wages for fair work (not).  Oh please sell your child into slavery to the NZ government.  We want someone to clean Chris Hipkins (minister of everything's) toilet.  Intergenerationally.  For less than minium wage.  Get a student to do it, right Chris?  The generations 50++ year PhD in cleaning your toilet for they pay the New Zealand Education System to do their 'workplace internship' in cleaning your toilet.  Intergenerationally.  For less than minimun wage.  No recourse for complaints.  Only a 'student' -- right?  Not even an employee.  A what now?  Don't you know how many generations of slavery are required for so much as minimum wage in New Zealand?  I mean...  People must be, like, 50 years +++ behind Chris Hipkins.  Who wears his intelligence and administration skills etc etc upon his sleeve.  Because they count the votes (yeah right).  When so many are kept in government institutions without so much as a post office box to their name.  Yeah, right.  All the work that goes into the prevention and prohibition of development...  The Harry Harlow Island Based Research Program.  They sold out the health of their people for what, now?  That's why we keep them the way that we do.  Of course.  All the honors and awards for the most esteemed Jacinda Ardern.  Her con-munications Degree from Waikato.  Then her PhD from Harvard in exchange for informing the graduating class how they were welcome to harvest their designer baby inplants from NZ without criminal sanctions.  Come get your designer babies.  The most designer baby of all being Angleman Syndrome Baby, of course, who (with the help of a little horse tranquiliser) will never  be able to object, protet, or complain how you choose to sexually and physically and psychologically abuse and torture them.  Of course.  The aim or purpose of Medicine.  To drug the non-consenting.  Because they have been consented.  What part of that is difficult?  The government decides what you voluntarily do.  From your education to your employment to your death.  Right?  Of course.  I mean, who did you think was the boss of you outside your workng hours.  Your what, now?  Party party party.  Who wants to party?  Anything anything anything it's soooooooooooooo competitive....  Yawn.
                            </p>

                            <p>So the governments have this idea of terrorist bombing graduations.  That's a good idea.  That way you will never have to pay them wages for doing skilled work.  Instead of people complaining about the university refusing to give them the qualifications they have met the requirements for, instead of people complaining about them refusing to publiclly advertise jobs, refusing to hire people for jobs they insist upon keeping vacant else only filling with violent offenders, the people can just die in a terrorist attack, then.  Else maybe the New Zealand government can send them off to 'fight for Ukraine' by which I mean dump them on Russian soil in the hope that the Russian Government will be blamed for their ill treatment and untimely death.  The Medical Students staying at Carrington College get to walk through the memorial every morning on their way into Medical School.  It's been carefully placed to be a constant reminder to them of what will happen to them if they object to anything the Government chooses to do.  The Government decides what you have voluntarily consented.  You have been voluntarily consented.  What part of that is hard to understand.  You lose, people of New Zealand.  People of Australasia.  All of the tax money and none of the social services.  The Government is the major employer (pretty much everything else was forced by the Government into bankruptcy with unlawful lock-down policies enforced by the police and New Zealand gangs working togethr to ensure the logistics of drug supply etc up and down the country).  We aren't even pretending to be a  nation that is even trying even a little  bit to be rule  by law. The laws are grotesquely inadequate and even when they aren't nobody cares what they say because they aren't inforced, at all.  Australia has decided that they don't care whether or not Aborginal people are written into the constitution.  New Zealand is written into the constitution.  How is that upheld?  Well, then.  It's all just a waste of time.  Completely and utterly.  The worse things are for the people of a country the better the leaders feel about themselves.  Didn't you know?  The prevention and prohibition of development.  Shortland street always was a Government Propaganda programme designed for people overseas to watch.  It was to help us blackbird for a constant supply of 'workers' who would arrive here only to discover that we would not acknowledge their qualifications, we would not sign off on new qualifications, we would not pay them, we would not pay them, we would not pay them, we would not pay them, they are to pay us for the cost of their 'training'.  But there is no supervision and there are no qualifications.  The Government will arrange a terrorist bombing of graduation else drafting to die on foreign lands.  Deportation.  Untimly death.  The government will not pay the workers.  Will not pay the workers.  You pay the government.  You pay the government.   You need to apply for a visa.   You need a new medical exam.   The doctors on payroll are to write reports for expulsion only.  Never stop paying.  Never stop paying.  Never stop paying the New Zealand government.  Never stop.  What's that?  Time to stop paying?  Why, then, it's time for you to go away.  Thanks for playing.  How many children hostages did you leave us?
                            </p>

                            <p>'In the name of cancer-care'.  I suppose that's a way to get rid of people.  Radiation oncology.  You could prescribe to people high doses of protease pump inhibitors.  That will reduce the amount of acid being produced in their stomach.  Then you could give them some kind of a nerve block to immobilise them.  Maybe from the neck down.  You could radition treatment their esophagus.  Esophageal spincter.  Then you could suddenly stop the ant-acid medication so they get a rebound syndrome.  All of a sudden they will be producing a lot of acid and with a weakened sphincter and having been immobilised I guess they will die in their acid secretions.  That would be a way to get people.  Quite a lot you could do with radiation oncology.  In conjunction with a few other things.  That's the aim or the goal or the purpose or point of the population control strategies that there are in public medicine or public health, in New Zealand?  No?  Yes?  Just following orders.  Of course.  From the way the patients are triaged on the basis of their home address and GP details and whatever the government has in their notes on them.  Maybe it is in their notes tha the government raised them as a Fisher and Paykel inubator baby where they kept them, like in one of those old Russian Orphanages where they weren't touched by humans to try and induce attachment disorders and the like.  So everyone can learn that they have been hand-picked chosen by the Government to be all special raised to be part of a gang with the party party party party party drug shipments.  That kind of a thing.  It's not plausible to think that we need to spend the next however many generations repeating all the inhuman and inhumane research experiments etc etc that were only ever poor, thin, weak, excuses for torturing and abusing and exterminating so many people.  We know exactly what we are doing...  That's why they have all of the money and all of the power.  Right?  Because of how clever they are?
                            </p>

                            <p>I wonder how many cloned people there are?  Genetically identical to someone else.  So that one of them can be organ donor for the other, should the need arise.  That will be why the ancestry stuff is...  Well, it's becoming problematic that people have access to paternity testing and genetic analysis, and the like.  I think estimates were someting like around 1/4 of people are wrong about who their genetic daddy is.  I guess there are a whole bunch of reasons why that might be so.  Of course 'she asked for it' is the best defence of the indefensible that there is.  That's why you hear it so much.  What else could they possibly say, in their defence?  Well, then, that's what 'voluntarily' means.  Clearly.  And when you get your supervisor a 100,000 + PhD thesis they say 'they thought you voluntarily quit'.  But you didn't say that you quit.  That's what makes it 'quiet quitting'.  I suppose.  Nobody hears you say 'I quit'.  They just write you up as a quitter and they don't write you a reference.  Then, if anybody asks, it's  because you are garbage garbage garbage.  Either you didn't write a thesis else they judged it to be garbage garbage garbage.  Because that's what external examination or external assessment means, now.  It means your supervisor gets to decide.  Not just whether they themselves will give you some of the vast volumes of research funds that they get (e.g., employing you as post-doc on the topic of their choosing) -- but whether anybody else is allowed to hire you.  They decide that nobody is allowed to hire you.  Because you are garbage garbage garbage.  They won't write you a reference.  They won't allow you to have your Degree.
                            </p>

                            <p>I guess the only reason he got the job is because he looks like one of Harry Harlow or Marc Hauser's laboratory animals escaped.  They will think that's soooooooo funny.  So the people from Harvard can visit Australia during their winter.  Party party party.  Let's have a party.  Let's have a weekend party where the people from Harvard can give their talks and we can just sing about how brilliant they are all day and all night...  Make sure the work we do is only singing the praises of the work they choose to present to us.  Party party.  Who wants to party?
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Of course Shortland Street is just trying to be what Grays Anatomy is trying to be..  Whatever the current version is.  Whatever it takes to sell 1 million dollar US Degrees in the USA.  Right?  And then the cost of sitting the Step exams and all the transport and flights and tourism activities associated with that...  For what?  So people can develop drug addictions (e.g., House, Nurse Jackie) or have the authority to get subordinate employees to drop their pants in the medical supply room, or whatever.  That's why people want to spend that much money on those Degrees.  Right?  It's so motivating and inspiring.  You should pay the University, pay the university, pay the University.  For the opportunity to to anything anything anything anything anything in...  In what, exactly?  In any hospital?  Anywhere in the world?
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            So the 'graduates' from Brown got to choose.  (1)  Early graduation.  That is to say, they would be given their Medical Degrees without having completed their supervised internship.  (2)  Indefinately post-poned graduation.  Because of Covid.  That is or means to say that there aren't any jobs for them.  Nobody will pay them to work that job.  Nobody will pay people to work jobs.  There aren't any jobs.  Not for things like that.  Social services.  Health, education, justice.  Everything has been overtaken by psychopaths.  It's soooooooooooooo competitive...
                            </p>

                            <p>Soo...  How are we going to motivate and inspire a future workforce of 'radiation oncologists' who will deliver lethal doses of radiation...  Gee, I don't know.  How did they motivate and inspire people to flip the switch on the legal doses of electric shock?  We find people who will just follow orders.  Not becuase the person wears a white coat.  But because...  I don't know.  Their manager told them to.  Maybe  because of the little note that someone or other put on their file notes.  You probably want a class..  Maybe 1,000 ++ studnets.  Each of them thinking that it's soooooooo competitive.  Oooooh.  I'll do anything anything anything anything anything.  Pick me!  Ooh choose me!!  Then you create division from within the cohort...  Have them turning on each other...  All the things that go into creating a compliant poplulation who will do anything anything...
                            </p>

                            <p>That's basically the culture, here.  In New Zealand.  Why suicide rates are so high.  Also 'suicide' rates (likely state ordered murders).  The volume of people imprisoned without just cause (e.g., because they protest acts of the government during their own free time outside working hours).  The volume of people imprisoned in the name of 'psychiatry'.  The judgements of the courts.  Judges -- pulled out of retirement (refusal to appoint new judges in accordance with the process that is supposed to be employed to ensure independence of the judiciary from the government).  The gaslighting in the judgements of the judges.  The judges ordering the lawyers (if the lawyers don't voluntarily go there) to gaslight the victims.  Blame the victims.  Punish the victims for speaking up and speaking out about the government atrocities and the atrocities that the government knows is happening that they refuse to do anything about.  Their constant, repeated, persistent decisions about who they hire.  Choosing to hire people to ensure their statutory function is not performed.  Is not performed by them, is not performed by anyone.  This is not the developed world.  It is not the developed world, at all.
                            </p>

                            <p>They (governments, government departments, executive branches e.g., hospitals and universities and the like) are only supposed to be hiring foreigners when there aren't any people within the country to work that job.  All the jobs in administration and management, in NZ filled by foreigners.  All the jobs in the hospitals and the universities filled  by foreigners.  While New Zealanders have their qualifications withheld and while New Zealanders are kept in detention facilities simply because they were born in New Zealand and they are not silent about the atrocities committed by the Goverment.  The Australian Federal Government will not allow people from the State of NZ to vote in Federal Elections, to stand for Federal Office.  Will not allow peope from the Australian State of New Zealand to apply (or have their application processed for) Ausstralian Federal Government Jobs.  New Zealanders are streamed into qualifications that the Australian Federal Government itself considers 'low value' and are expected to stake second stage to Australian Citizens born of every state other than New Zealand.  But then, the main purpose or point of the Australian Government is to be second rate American Government, so, well.  So they can pay a million dollars for their Medical Degrees from the Ivy League only to be informed that they can either 'Graduate Early'
  without having supervised workplace internship signed off as completed by the University.  That is to say, they can have their Degree on an 'honorary basis' else their qualification is withheld indefinately.  That is to say, they just don't choose them.  Not to go wrongful deathbringing in the detention camps of America...  Guess they will only take your money take your money take your money.  I wonder how much the guy from South Africa had to pay the New Zealand Government to play 'Orthopedic Surgeon' in the hospitals of New Zealand for 10 days before being made bachelor again.  He must have really  hated his wife to have paid to have dumped her at Hillmorton indefinately.  Did she try and speak out about the crimes of the New Zealand Government?  About his not really being an Orthopedic Surgeon?  Only 'Orthopedic Surgeon' on payroll at Canterbury District Health Board, was he?                           </p>

  <p>Their whole attitude when you complain about them not even trying to be rule of or rule by law (governed by principles of justice and fairness and rules based order) is 'and what are you going to do about it?  you and whose army?'  Does that seem like 'rule by law' to you?  I mean, not even a little bit of 'try'.
</p>

<p>They say that if people lived the way the average New Zealander lives that we would need 2 planets.  Does the average New Zealander live the way that they actually want to live -- or do they live the way that the New Zealand Government has mandated how they will live?  Are people provided with information about how to make good food choices (e.g, ingredients lists, information about how much they pay their workers, information about their health and safety compliance, information about animal welfare conditions, information about slavery in the supply chain, information about sustainable business practices) or does the Government encourage if not actively itself choose to participate in marketing campaigns etc trying to actively create demand for things that it then wants to chastise the people for?  System of abuse.  Over and over and over and over and over.  Yawn.  So f*cking tiresome.  Hey, if what England did to the Irish during the Irish famine was tolerated on the world stage then the New Zealand Government has something even worse to aspire to -- right?  It isn't that people in these parts are so very very bad at being good.  It's more how good they are at being bad.  I mean, the principle of charity can only get us so far once we realise the state sanctioned 'charity' detention camp system of abuse up and down the land...
</p>

<p>Harlene Hayes (formerly University of Otago Vice Chancellor) trained as an Organisational Psychologist.  That is some kind or sort of a cross between management and psychology.  A large part of the source of power for occupational psychology was in control over tests.  The Univesrity of Waikato had, for example (I suppose every University would have) a Psychology Testing Library.  That would have the questions (and answers) for the personality tests and the like that would be used to select employees for various jobs.  From prison guards to all kinds of things.  I remember the Waikato people saying that various people who wanted to be prison guards would turn up to the University looking to access the Psychology Testing Library so that they would pass the screening tests to be a prison guard.  I don't know who they paid for access.  But that was a source of power.  I suppose police etc, too.  I remember the Department of Corrections required me to participate in testing when I applied for Government Jobs (entry level analyst or advisor) -- mostly so they could tell me that I test badly and they just don't choose me.  So you have more than 1 year of 'frictional unemployment' where you can live in the shed of some contractor -- right?  Anyway, here is an idea about organisational psychology...  Instead of having a normal or usual kind of a career progression where people start out on fairly low wages but work their way up within the organisation by taking on more responsibility for more pay...  What you can do is continually restructure things.  So that people are required to do more and more and more for the same level of pay...  Reapplying for their old job at less pay or whatever.  I mean, ideally, I suppose (from a maximally efficient final solution sort of ideological position) you would force people to work more and more and more for less and less and less pay.  I say this because of how terribly awfully oppressive the Univesrity of Otago environment was for many of the employees of the University.  The University would not hire more people to teach and research (you only need 1 lecturer per 1,000 studnets, or similar) so graduates are forced into administration and management jobs or other supporting roles, and then you just keep restructuring and restructuring and restructuring so more and more and more people do more and more and more busy work for less and less and less pay. While the University posts record levels of profit.  And refuses to supply applications to enrol, progress applications to enrol, progress qualification completions and the like.  I think it is important that Harlene Hayes herself trained as an organisational psychologist.  It helps understand the kind of prison camp detention camp institution that she maintained.  She would have learned about (will know full well about) the psychological effects of the continuued restructures etc.  Of course now she has been re-deployed to the Univesrity of Western Australia.  They have a selection programme (that New Zealanders can buy into -- but they will need to pay Australian Dollars for it while likely earning only New Zealand dollars themselves) where they can, effectivey, pay the University of Western Australia to take their 18 year old High School Student and enrol them in Medicine and they can send them for their internships around the Aboriginal Communities of Australia, I suppose.  I would imagine that the ideology will be that Harlene will ensure that nobody signs off on their internships, however (or that if they achieve sign-off the University won't graduate them, anyway).  That was the culmination of her career at Otago -- right?  That something like 1/3rd of the Medical Cohort were denied graduation (but put to work as Junior Doctors for the DHB's while they paid more money to Otago for continueed enrolment as studnets).  I suppose really the culmination or end game of maximal efficiency will be a terrorist bombing of graduation.  By the Government.  So that the Government can say 'thanks for all the unpaid slave labor you did while paying the University paying the University paying the University.  Now it is time for us to pay you for any work you do.  Therefore it is time for  you to die.  We have a entire new generation of studnets who will do your slabor (slave-labor) while paying the University paying the University paying the University'.  Never stop paying the University.  Else, know what?  Maybe they wil pay you to keep slaves of your own.  Right?  That's how you know you have made it in Australasia.  When they pay you enough to keep your very own Harem.
</p>

<p>Crampton said something in print about how he disagreed with the Government's assessment that the Government was not going to pay anybody to research, manufacture, supply, administer rapid antibody testing for the reason that the tests were not as effective as PCR (and not for the reason that the Government is not being merit based in procurement decisions).  He claims that he was 'expert led' in believing that the antibody tests weren't (necessarily?) getting too many false negatives.  The New York times claimed that the USA was sending some of the antibody tests back to Australia because they were getting 1 in 4 false positives.  That means to say that 10 people in every 40 who were actually negative for Covid would return a positive test.  Or, if you were negative over the course of a couple years and you took 40 of those tests over a couple years then you would be expected to test positive on one of the tests.  That was though to be an unacceptably high false positive rate.  But the New Zealand Government accused all of the antibody tests of being too likely to return a false negative.  They were more concerned about collecting Covid Positive statistics to keep up with where things were at in the world.  Where there needs to be a baseline of positive in order to indicate that there is a signal at all.  I mean to say, when New Zealand doesn't find a case but the false positive rate on the tests is 1 in 4 then you know that New Zealand isn't properly able to identify and record positive test findings.  Either people aren't reporting the postive test results or...  Corruption...
</p>

<p>It is interesting that this guy (Academic at Otago) says he 'followed the experts and not the Government' when it came to him deciding for himself that New Zealand should get with the programme and roll out antibody tests since antibody tests had been rolled out in the USA, Canada, Australia..  The other nations, already.  They were manufacturing them in Australia and quality control was apparently sending them back from the USA.  Best ship them to New Zealand then, eh?  I guess that's what it means to follow the experts?  I don't think he understands what it means to follow the expert.  That's why Jacinda got an honorary PhD in Law -- no?  Because she the apex or prime expert in Law.  Or in Statutory Law of New Zealand.  I guess?  She could be professor, now, and teach the students her memoirs?  They are writing a curriculum for the 'leadership' programme at Harvard.  Because a question on the forefront of many rich kids minds is 'how much money would you have to pay in order to be God ruler of a tiny little Pacific Island nation?'  Part of the answer was in kim.com.  MegaUploads.  Right?  What was that?  A cloud server.  We were supposed to belive that it was primarily about people uploading copyright protected (in the USA and possibly Europe) music and films.  But more likely than not it was primarily about...  Universities...  I would suppose.  Uploading porn that people filmed in the student accommodations.  The evidence of crimes.  The evidence of abuse in all kinds of State care situations.  The prisons and the schools and so on.  I would imagine.  That was the real import.  Because of New Zealand's role in being a repository for the offenders of the world.  At one point it looked like he was going to buy the election.  Right?  But now he pays the courts he pays the courts he pays the courts he pays the courts he pays the courts he pays the courts he pays the courts he pays.  And in return they find that the case becomes larger and larger and larger traversing more and more issues.  And all of these aspects need their day in court.  So he pays the courts he pays the courts he pays the courts he pays.  And in return his going to the court of appeal is deemed 'Public Interest' while New Zealand refuses to extradite him to stand trial in the USA.  I guess because he is already imprisoned in the detention camp that is New Zealand.  The University of Auckland is presently spamming emails to people telling them that the University of Auckland cloud server is being removed from alumi access, or similar.  I guess that means that the videos of who was most rape-y at law camp are coming down.  Which of the first year private school boys got to rape the 14 year old international studnets from Vietnam, or whatever, before the international studnets were deported for overstaying their visa because the government refused to accept their medical clearance.  Or whatever.  
</p>

<p>We are living in a period that will, one day, be known as culturally and intellectually and artisitically and so on the dark or middle ages.  The Government won't allow people to function.  People who proclaim that the world is round (for reasons) are imprisoned, in New Zealand.  The Government withholds funds from them in an attempt to force them into dependency on people the Government has identified as abusers, typically.  They choose to pay people to abuse others, right?  To get them to toe the line.  The line where the Government is the prime or apical expert and people listen to the Government.  Not like they would listen to an academic.  Where they listen to what they say and the reasons they have for saying and they reflect upon and consider objections and make up their own minds.  But where the Government sets itself up as a God dictating for reasons that they are not accountable for or to.  The Judges don't uphold the Statutory Laws in New Zealand  -- therefore it does not matter what the Statutory Laws are or what they say, at all.  If the Judges won't uphold the laws (deliver meaningful sanctions for ultra vires acts and deliver meaningful sanctions for people refusing to perform their statutory function) then there may as well not be any laws at all.  There really is nothing here...  The Education Act states that the primary function of Universities is research.  Look at all the research I have done for Universities where the Universities refuse to acknowledge any of the research that I have done.  Look at the research output of the University of Waikato.  How many thousands of words of research do their Philosophy academics produce per year?  Do they produce as many words per year as a first year student (e.g., 1,500 words x 2 essays per course x 7 courses per year = 21,000 words of research by a first year student writtten and examined within 34 weeks)?  Do they produce as many words per year as a second year student?  2,500 words 2x essays per course x 7 courses per year = 35,000 words per year or 34 weeks?  do they produce as much as an honors student?  2 x 5,000 words per course x 4 courses or 40,000 words per year?  do they produce as much as a masters student?  up to 50,000 words in one year?  do they produce as much as a PhD student?  A 3 year enrolment up to 100,000 words where external examination takes one year?  That's a research output of up to 50,000 words per year.  Where is all the research New Zealand?  It is like New Zealand doesn't have Universities.  THey won't pay people who do reasearch.  They will pay people who won't do research.  They will pay people to prevent and prohibit the production of research.  There always was this joke about how the Governmetn won't hire anybody with a PhD to write Government reports.  Because the Ministers are expected to be able to read the reports.  But of course the Ministers only glance at the Table of Contents.  So the entire work needs to be saying the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over so the Ministers don't need to read the reports.  I mean, you just write up (retrospectively) the best justification that you possibly can of what they have decided in quite independent grounds (for no reason) anyway.  Right?  I mean...  Let's see...  What is the best possible reason or excuse for the Government forcing people to live in mouldy houses?  Maybe because they don't believe that living in mouldy houses is harmful to people so they have decided to check and see if it is harmful to us in our unique sociocultural enviroment which will, of course, involve them requiring people to function as the control group and live in mouldy houses.  That explains why the Government needs to check just how mouldy the house is (keep on measuring the mould) and take steps to ensure that it is mouldy enough (that the exposure is high enough) to just see...  Because surely a toxic dose isn't really toxic when New Zealand is the land of immunologically elite people who aren't dead yet despite every effort from the Government.  That sounds like the kind of research project that would get Government funding.  It sounds like the only kind or sort of project that would.
</p>

<p>Apparently the New Zealand courts actually found that one young man died of myocarditis due to a Covid Vaccination.  The Vaccination wasn't one that he freely consented to having (or not having).  Was it?  Wasn't he coerced by the Government into having the vaccination on threat of him being excluded from society and excluded from employment if he refused?  Loss of livlihood.  I mean to say, did he understand, broadly, the risk and benefits of vaccination?  Or did the Government try and withhold information about risks because they were concerned that if they were informed of the risks people woud choose not to assume that risk.  I mean to say, the Government tried to withhold information about harms because they thought that if people were informed about harms they would not want to take on the risk that the Government wanted them to take on.  The Government waived the manufacturers liability, apparently.  That is to say if there is a problem with the quality of the manufacturing process or similar the New Zealand Government is taking on the liability.  Cheapest country in the world.  The manufacturers could have sent saline instead of vaccination and then if people died of Covid believing that they were immune then the New Zealand Government and not the manufacturers is responsible for yet another wrongful death.  The Government wants all of the liabilty and responsibility because...  They know full well that New Zealand does not have a functioning judiciary.  Where is the pay-out for the victims of the Governments crimes?  Did the people knowingly sign up to participate in a medical experiment?  A medical trial to see whether vaccination was harmful or helpful?  Did they knowingly sign up for 'emergency use authorisation only' 'medical treatment'?  Or were they coerced into it by the Government.  The Government does not appear to respect the people, at all.  Who is supposed to assume all the risks?  Who gets to make all the decisions about who gets to assume all the risks?  What are the consequences for a few elite individuals choosing that the risks will be assumed  by others with no responsibility, at all, for themselves?  Not a functioning democracy.  Nasty little despot.  HOw much money did Epstein pay to be God of the Virgin Islands.  (Who wouldn't want that title -- right?) Where is he, now?  Did he have an open casket funeral so his victims could see that he was in fact dead.  He didn't just pay the New Zealand Government a bunch of money to set himself up at head of the Medicine Prepratory School of New Zealand where it's soooooooo competitive the 14 year old specials will do anything anything anything anything anything anything.  
</p>

<p>So the whole idea/l of inflation is about trying to preserve the current situation and projections with respect to people position on a social hierarchy.   Because it is all about having money sufficient to position you so that you have control of as many people as possible where you can get them to do anything anything anything anything anything anything anything that you want them to do.  I mean, you could have a child.  Who is dependent on you to wipe it's arse, to feed it, and so on.  And you can train it to do your washing or cleaning or whatever.  Or you could train it to hit the other kids until the other kids do your washing or cleaning or whatever.  So you pay Chris Whelan in his position as Chief Executive of the New Zealand Vice Chancellor's Committee (with the Statutory Function of upholding the quality and integrity of New Zealand University qualifications where the Universities decide on non-academic grounds who they will enrol, who they will acknowledge is progressing through training, who they will graduate (on an honorary basis irrespective of whether they have done any academic work at all and irrespective of the quality as determined by external examiners who were not involved in any way in the production process).  And he gets paid enough so that, apparently, it isn't the New Zealand Government who pays for him to go Blackbirding in South America or Vietnam for children to enrol in New Zealand Primary or Secondary or Tertiary Education Institutions (like the 14 year old Vietnamese Finance studnet).  Rather, he gets paid enough so that these little excursions of his are paid for on his own dime.  I suppose he had a NZVCC email address that he uses to do business when it comes to how much money is to be handed over to the New Zealand Government as a kind of...  Dowry?  For the student?  Is that how to think of it?  Does he pay for his own cellphone?
</p>

<p>
The obvious absurdity in the Judge saying that he would be behaving ultra vires if he performed his statutory function.  The obvious absurdity in the Judge saying that his job was to write the NZVCC policy therefore he was not bound by the policy that he wrote  because he could change it retrospectively.  He is still on payroll.  Yes?  Several hundred thousand dollars per year to support his lifestyle.  I don't know anything about him personally.   How many people are financially dependent on him?  HOw many people are forced to live in his household for low or no rent?  Mates rates.  How many people are forced to eat the way he chooses for them to eat?  How many people are forced to wear what he forces them to wear?  And so on.  That's inflation.  The point or the purpose of it.  To keep the social structures.  The aim or the goal is to be God.  God of a nasty little despot where all the people do all day is sit around singing your praises doing anything anything anything anything anything outside a nightclub on a Friday night for $20.  Right, John Key?  That is what you think of the people.  That was your bright idea/l of how to force vaccine compliance.  Anything anything anything outside a nightclub on a Friday night.  That is how the Government wants to keep the people.  Inflaction will be arranged accordingly.  Where is the art?  culture?  meaning?  value?  justice?  health?  happiness?  NOthing to see, people.  NOthing to see, at all.  Nasty little despot.
</p>

<p>I mean, there aren't any people, at all.  The whole point or goal or aim or purpose is to command the largest zombie army.  Right?  The New Zealand Government wanted to force certain people to breed breed breed breed breed.  They will do anything anything anything for an extra $20 per week, per child?  Wasn't that the Government Guarantee?  You would get a living wage (for you) from Work and Income if you produced how many babies?  And abused them sufficiently at home such that the Government didn't feel the need to remove them and arrange for them to be absued in state care. Right?  To beat them and force them to compliance...  So they would be trained to do anything anything anything anything anything for $20 outside a nightclub on a Friday night.  Or anything anything anything for a cigarette.  That's inflation.  To withhold money and ciagarettes or anything that you can use to control people to do anything anything anything anything.  And what does the New Zealand Government value?  Apparently we are supposed to do anything anything anything the Government says..  To support the lifestyle of the Politicians?  That's part of it.  They want to fly about the world (on the taxpayers dime?) with their entourage of dependents...  God of a South Pacific Island...  Seeing how they can sell out the health (education, justice etc etc) of the people to support their own personal party party party lifestyle where people will do anything anything anything they say.  Hanging off of their every word...  That's what life is about.  Right?  Graduation is about getting to wear the fancy gown and speaking and people clap clap clap at everything you say.  That's what the culminiation of University is.  
</p>

<p>So where are the academics?  The people engaged in research etc?  Not here.  Dark ages.  Seems to be the thing of it.  There really aren't any people...  Not so far as the eye can see...  No people.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  Just a zombie army.  Living out our pathology of keeping as many in appalling conditions of deprivation and forced compliance.
