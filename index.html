                            <article>

                                <p>Branches and beheadings...
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                I am very confused about how things seem to be with the education system, health system, and judiciary of New Zealand.   
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                It seems to me that the Universities of New Zealand are not functioning as Universities.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I think there are false assertions in the High Court Proceedings.  For example, that I attempted to complete a qualification under-time.  Firstly, a 120 point qualification involves a minimum enrolment period of 34 weeks (TEC).  Secondly, I don't think that undergraduates are failed for submitting their work or finishing an examination early.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                More problematic than this is that the High Courts seem willing to assert that the Universities are not required to supply applications to enrol or to process applications to enrol according to published criterion.  They can throw away applications for arbitrary reasons and they are not accountable to the courts for decisions they make about who to include and who to exclude from University study. They don't have to examine students work if they don't want to.  They are free to set domestic standards in excess of international standards including preventing externals from signing off on qualification completion by refusing to get the work out to externals.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I don't know why the courts would refuse to uphold the Education and Training Act.  I thought it was some kind of set-up to get things through the Court of Appeal but subsequently the Court of Appeal has deemed the proceedings abandoned because I was not able to pay them excess of $20,000 security for costs.  This decision was upheld by the Supreme Court of New Zealand.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I do not know why the judiciary of New Zealand would want to document that New Zealand is not rule by law because the Judiciary refuses to uphold the laws of New Zealand. 
                                </p>

                                <p>I do not know how anybody can do business in this Jurisdiction
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                It turns out that New Zealand hasn't been enrolling or progressing or graduating or employing Medical Doctors, really, at all.  And the Courts won't make them and the courts won't remove the people who are preventing and prohibiting the Universities from functioning as Universities etc.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                So, I don't really see how it is possible to function, here.  I don't know for how much longer the administration of New Zealand will be acknowledged by international community.  I don't know what will need to happen for the various offenders to cease and desist so that New Zealand can develop.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I am concerned that New Zealand might be (or might be becoming) something like the detention or slave camp of the world where the only people who are graduated or enrolled are people who bribe or cheat their way in.  That way the administration can feel entitlted to demand bribes later and then refuse to graduate or employ them since they are cheats.  I can't see anything other than an administration who wants control over people who have no option but to comply with their demands. 
                                </p>
