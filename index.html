                        <div class="container">

                            <p>I remember when I was at Primary School...  My primary school (Melville Primary, Hamilton) had a swimming pool that was open for rather a lot of the year.  And that was pretty great.  When it was open the more senior students had swimming times scheduled for earlier in the day and the youngest kids had their swimming times scheduled for the afternoons..  There were male and female change facilities.  Things were a bit embarrasing with some kids getting a mothers or doctors or whatever note to not do swimming (girls must have their periods to get out of swimming was the assumption)...  And the change room facilities were a little embarrassing...  I remember people crowding around one student to protect...  I don't know why because I wasn't part of that crowd...  Early onset puberty?  Hair where other studnets didn't have hair yet?  Who knows why?  The point is that these sorts of things were in people's minds.  Fears.  And so on.  </p>

                            <p>I was also really really fortunate as a student of Melville Primary to be treked through at various points in the year, to swimming lessons at the Hamilton swimming pools out at Te Rapa.  I mean, we are talking Olympic Games Swimming Facilties (to the best of my knowledge).  I remember the change room facilities there.  There was an open change room (in the women's room at least) but there were also individual stalls.  What that meant was that you had the option of showering with your swimming trunks on (or not) and changing in the open change facilities (or not).  I remember as a young girl that sometimes 2 or 3 kids would choose to go into an 'individual stall' and change in there.  Maybe because they were actually sisters..  Or, whatever.  For whatever reason.  One could change in public or private.  </p>

                            <p>I guess I think that to my mind the option or availability of an individual stall (for whatever reason).  Male or female.  Or who knows who or why or for what reason..  It doesn't matter.  Privacy.</p>

                            <p>Sometimes people choose to stop playing sports because of the changing room environment.  I know of more than a couple male athltes who were brilliant..  Who quit playing sport because they personally identified as gay and they didn't want to deal with open male change rooms.  THey were afraid that if they looked away and kept to themsleves that males would be offended that they weren't looking at them (since they were gay that means they were required to get a hard on for every man)...  Or if they did look at them then they would get beaten up for looking.. They felt that it was an impossible situation for them to navigate as 14 or 15 or 16 year old boys..  So they simply quit playing sport...</p>

                            <p>The option of private change room facilities for whatever reason.  To take a piss or a dump in private.  Change your pad or your tampon.  Wash yourself without other people taking a look (to mock or bully or poke fun at for difference).  It is somewhat expensive to set up private change room facilities.. But the real resistence is typically political.  Bullying and abuse etc.</p>

                            <p>___</p>

                            <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/496277/senior-doctors-dentists-who-work-in-hospitals-vote-to-strike  SMO cry cry cry cry cry that their harem is having a hard time buying fresh fruit and toilet paper..  Meanwhile..  The 'universites' of NZL are too f*cking stupid to process an applicaton to enrol...  Nobody home, hey.  Nothing there in fact.   </p>

                            <p>So...  F*cking hell...  I needes't to explain dis sh*t for free -- cause nobody else is gonna...</p>

                            <p>I'm sorry -- how much money am I worth, again?  I wouldn't ask... But y'all made it clear to me...  Where is the money?  Where is the money? Where is the money? Ad Nauseum..  Where is the money>>  Where is teh money?  Smashing you in teh face.. in teh back for the money... Where is the money? Where did ht go> Where is mjy money? Taking off your knee caps.  Where is the money?  Where did it go>??</p>

                            <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/300953944/nz-election-2023-live-pm-chris-hipkins-gives-postcabinet-update-as-senior-doctors-vote-to-strike  Oh no!  Oh they won't pay them!  They won't enrol them, they won't graduate them, they won't employ them!  They won't pay them!  They won't pay them!  They won't pay them!  There's nothing there!  Nobody graduated from the progamme.  Nobody enrolled!  There's nothing there!!!  ALLL OF The money for.. Uh.. Kim Sterelny.  Harlene Hayes.  Dr Leeks.  Dr Green.  Nobody else's appication acknowledged as recieved.  There's, uh, *NOTHING THERE.  NOBODY HOME*</p>

                            <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/132695097/nicotine-lozenges--the-hottest-currency-inside-the-countrys-prisons  The problem is that there never will be enough nicotine lozenges (cigarettes, money etc etc) for people to have genuine need met.  Never will be enough.  That's the basic principle of economics that you need to get into or get through your thick skull.  The foundation of economics is:  Deprivation.  It is about keeping some people deprived.  Keeping them poorly.  There never will be enough to go around.  Comprehend - aye?  Now we understand.  Things must be kept competitive.  Competition!  It has to be sooooo competitive!  It just has to be artifically constructed to be a competition.  Why?  Because we want there to be losers.  We want there to be slaves. We want there to be people kept in deprivation.  People kept poorly.  Why?  So they will do anything anything anything anything that their superiors say.  It's sooooo competitive.  What did you want from your studnets Dr Leeks?  What did you require from the ones you were willing to sign off on as having completed their training in psychiatry?  Did you sign off on any of them?  What are they doing now? Distinguishing themselves Uffindell-like to be real leaders.  Willing to do what the teachers or guards or whatever say when it comes to picking out picking on and bullying this one or that one...  Why?  To keep them in line.  Bullying and abuse.  Deprivation.  Fear.  Loathing.  HOstility.  Maybe you can break them.  Do a needs assessment.  See if they need company (therefore seculusion for them only isoloation) or if they need solitude (thereore must be kept with at least one bunk mate at all times).  For the purposes of bullying and abuse and...  Torture.  We will have things no other way.  It's quite motivating and inspiring -- isn't it?  Doesn't it make you want to join them for all the right reasons?  The right reasons being not being kept in those appalling conditions of torture yourself.  What better reason could there possibly be?  Motivating and inspiring.  That's apparently what they take themselves to be.</p>

                            <p>So the government is trying to blame the people for not being financially literate that the government doesn't pay the workers.  That the government records false levels of debt against people's names.  Keeping false enrolment records and false records about programmes of study etc etc.  The government is trying to teach the people to hand all the money over to the government.  Put money into long term savings plans with the governmnt (we all know the money won't be there when you retire -- the government will have spent it all on themselves well before then)...  Purchase insurance?  But the insurance companies won't pay out.  Only reason to purchase insurance is when it is a condition of your mortgage so you don't have any other options.  That's what NZ is -- right?  How low can we go?  For people with no other options.  People who were born here (through no fault of their own) or people (often criminals) who flee here from overseas.  Let kim.com market NZ to the world.  If you come here from the USA you will not be extradited to stand trial for your crimes.  No extradition to the USA to stand trial.  Well, then, let anybody fearing prosectution from the USA government come to NZL.  Where they can continue on their criminal activity without fear of prosecution since the 'universities' can't even won't even process applications to enrol, completions of training.  But even if they did they would never register lawyers.  Even if they did they would never pay them.  Not if they were actually capable of filing before a filing deadline etc etc.  Lowest rate of successful prosecution of corruption related offences in the world, wasn't it?  It's like they've had their eyes poked out.</p>

                            <p>Why doesn't NZ have radiology?  Radiology has a centralised IT thing.  All the images.  DEXA or similar.  There is a centralised platform.  Unlike pathology.  There is not a centralised platform for pathology.  Not sure how much pathology work involves electronic (software driven) microscopy / photography / video vs how much of pathology is kept offline.  I mean to say that are we really supposed to believe that international community is shutting radiologists out of access to the scanned images?  Not likely.  What is more likely is that we simply don't have any radiologists.  Radiologists are the ones who write the radiology reports.  How many scans are given to radiologists (in NZ) to be made available to patients, surgeons, GPS etc WITH RADIOLOGY REPORTS?  Do we have any radiologists?  Writing radiology reports?  Doing radiology...  Whether something appears as a tumor or normal variation.  What the density is consistent with?  Or do the surgeons just color the bits they want to chop out red and show the patient the red bits and say 'see!  I fix it!'  Who signs informed consent for things like x-rays, anyway.  Isn't the idea to x-ray people soooo many times that they develop cancer?  I thought the idea was to murder death kill.  Murder death kill.  I mean, they aren't processing applications to enrol or progressions through training...  Blackbirding for criminals from the USA to come here...  Maybe play Orthopedics for 10 days and dump your wife at Hillmorton?  Only cost you..  HOwever much visa processing fee.  Then places in quarantine (while NZ citizens were kept out so that 5 SOuth Africans could be expedited through for the princely sum of??  How much??)  What health system?</p>

                            <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/132778326/labour-promises-compulsory-financial-literacy-lessons-for-school-children-national-backs-the-idea  And when the Inland Revenue Department records students as having student loans -- for courses or programmes of study they never even applied to be enrolled in...  That's okay -- according to judges re-appointed from retirement for the occasion.  Is that what you are going to teach them in the schools?   </p>

                            <p>Who was the champion for the Waikato supposed to be?  Henry Bennett?  Where are the students that he trained and signed off on?  Nobody?  Nobody was good enough for him?  Payroll for him (into retirement) until the day that he died?  Where are all his former studnets?  Shane Reti?  He was Waikato?  Now he explains to his constituency (what ties does he have to or for them) why the Whangarei hospital has..  Nobody.  He's registered to pratice.  Right?  For 1 or was that 3 weeks per year (only when government is on holiday) what a f*cking farce of a f*cking joke.  What idiot population need me to point out state the f*cking obvious.  Come on.  Retard land indeed.  Nobody home land.  What democracy?/p>

                            <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/300951508/it-was-a-clusterf-1080-blackmailer-jeremy-kerr-speaks-about-infamous-baby-formula-hoax-for-first-time  Was this before, during, or after Melamine was being put in the Infant Formula?  NZ decided to spend hundreds of thousands (if not millions) on advertising the milk powder as being free of round-up (but not melamine) -- is that the basic idea?  There is no alternative to round-up.  Never was.  Never will be.  NZ is the control group on the 'round up maybe doesn't cause issues or problems' leg of the experiment.  Right?  Of course nobody would have got ethics approval to run that overseas. Ethics approval?  What is that?  Is that where you find some criminal to pay hundreds of thousand if not millions to to assert that it's like he's had his eyes poked out and he simply cannot see anything wrong? </p>

                            <p>Let's talk about Maaori and science.  Let's talk about how they aren't getting nuclear submarines for the next...  100?  500?  Years (at least).  They aren't getting satellites...  Let's talk about Maaori science.  About the state of Maaori science.  About what technologies Maaori are and are not allowed.  I mean to say, if the elite white Australians aren't allowed nuclear submarines for the next 15 years (at least) then how much slower are Maaori expected to be following...  However many years behind...</p>

                            <p>Oh me oh my it's sooooooooo competitive.  It's sooooooo competitive.  Better ship people from South Africa and England and so on to 'look after' all the Maaori babies etc.  It's sooooo competitive.  Oh me, oh my.  And look at the state of Maaori science.  Let the tribal leaders tell the world which of the kids they are required to train (in the name of equity) because no other kids from their tribe are to be given those opportunities.  The leaders have all been picked out.  To go awwwwwww there.  Feel  better.  There's nothing we can do.  Awwwwww.  Look at the state of Maaori science.  Best get Dawkins to come to NZ and tell everyone about how f*cking selfish he is.  Selfish, selfish, selfish.  Him and his selfish f*cking genes.  It's sooooooo competitive.  Selfish selfish selfish.</p>

                            <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/496132/otago-graduates-make-history-by-defending-at-home </p>

                            <p>They made history becuase they were the only University of Otago students to be acnowledged as having completed their PhD within 3 years?  I bet they weren't acknowledged as having completed within 3 years.  I bet Otago got at least 4 years of government funding to have them enrolled and reenrolled and re re re enrolled.  </p>

                            <p>You aren't supposed to defend your thesis to people who are supposed to be supporting you to complete it.  People who are supposed to be helping you and wanting you to succeed.  You don't defend your thesis against your biggest supporters...  What sense is there in that?</p>

                            <p>Is international community supposed to be hostile, then?  Um..  Well...  I remember reading a book or two... From people in Ausssie and so on.  People writing about how they approach externally examining PhD's.  I remember them saying that they really wanted to pass the thesis.  That the students had obviously and clearly worked hard at it.  Put in a lot of work.  That they felt their job was to suggest bits to make it a bit better and be there to watch the students succeed.  Witness.  Publicity.  Two people from overseas examined the thesis.  That means to say they were paid to read it and think about it and comment on it.  Publicity.  Acknowledgement.  Not only by local community but by international.</p>

                            <p>These Maaori students didn't get to present their research to Indigenous or non-indegenous communities overseas.  Nobody from overseas came to NZ for their thesis defence.  The thesis defence is the showcase.  The students get to say what they did..  Answer questions that they know the answer to.  Demonstrate their expertise.  Be seen to be experts.</p>

                            <p>The people employed out at Tamaki to do public health used to say that the tribal leaders send their kids to Tamaki so they can be picked to do Medical School so they can be sent back to the local communities as Doctor.  They aren't supposed to be going overseas.  They are the property of their local community.  But they didn't see why they would send them to University if they had already picked them to be leaders of their local tribe.  Just keep them in the local tribe, then.  WHy send them to University at all?</p>

                            <p>I don't think NZ students (or Australian students) have oral defences of their PhD's.  I never saw any studnets defend their thesis to external examiners my whole time I was at the ANU.  And the supervisors would choose to support some of their studnets and choose to destroy others.  Like how Kim Sterelny interrupted other staffs questioning of Brett and Ben for their 6 monthly review.  And then he wouldn't even come to fellows for a drink after my mid-term (as was customary) after being most hostile questioner for my mid-term.  Nobody seemed to have a problem with my mid-term.  Except for him.  It's soooooo hostile.  Except that Ben and Brett and Rachel and so on didn't ever actually defend their thesis against external examination -- did they?  I don't remember externals questioning them...  Did they actually get reports from international examiners?  Suggesting changes to their theses to make their theses better?  Or did the University just decide to hand them their qualificatios for unknown reasons, really, while refusing to acknowledge any of my work.  How many years did Carl slave before his work was acknowledged?  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                            <p>__</p>

                            <p>I just love this idea that Professor Glue (for example) is going to try and recruit psychiatrists and mental health nurses etc from overseas by telling them all about his work at conferences.  People are going to roll up to listen to him talk about how he gives ketamine to particularly young female clients or patients who have been deemed non-responsive to any other form of treatment.  Last resort for them, at such a young age.  Horse tranquiliser.  Then we can see how many people who didn't think that NZ was a place where they wanted to go to practice psychiatry or mental health nursing..  We can see how many of them are going to, after hearing his presentation at conference, pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for visa processing.  For airfares.  Pay and pay and pay and pay and pay because they want to continue on the good works of Professor Glue with his Glue Factory that he's got going on there.  It's a wonderful solution to how NZ is going to train the next generation of psychiatrists and mental health nurses.  See how many people from overseas will pay and pay and pay and pay and pay to get in on the action.</p>

                            <p>Our reputation will likely help us on the world stage, as well.  The ideal of being made  bachelor again.  Your wife being imprisoned in a literal prison or maybe a psychiatric institution like Hillmorton.  Look into that maybe, see if that is a place where you might like to work.  Get in there and do a little anything anything anything with immunity to any kinds of consequences.  Read up on the crimes committted by various people on payroll (supposedly or apparently) as 'doctor'.  The drink driving offences.  The involuntary organ harvest (wrong leg, sorry).  The cervical examinations performed on non-consenting patients.  Take all of this to international conferences and see how many foreigners are willing to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay to move to NZ on the promise of them getting to call themselves 'doctor' and do anything anything anything.</p>

                            <p>At least they don't have to worry about local 'competition' since the only local 'Universities' (Auckland and Otago) are unwilling and unable to process applications to enrol in Medicine.  But even if they manage to process an application to enrol they won't process a graduation.  But even if they did do that the registration people would never register the graduates.  But even if the registration people did register the graduates they would never actually be employed to do clinical work.  They would rather pay them to go overseas and blackbird for foreign criminals to come to NZ and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay in return for getting to do anything anything anything.  So long as it is continuing on the good works of Professor Green and Leeks and Glue..  They will not have things any other way.  Quite by design.</p>

                            <p>The Waikato Times has reported several occasions of the Waikato District Health Board having people on payroll for Psychiatry who never went to Medical School.  They were frauds.  Hoaxes.  It is disingenuous to suppose that they did not know this when they chose to employ them.  When they chose to throw everybody else's application away.  When they chose to allow the frauds to pay and pay and pay for visa etc.  Why?  I think because the DHB didn't pay them very much.  So they were relatively cheap workers.  One of the frauds they hired said he never wrote any prescriptions.  He would always get a second opinion or something and he just never signed his name on any prescription sripts for medication.  So I don't know, then, who was responsible for drugging those patients.  If they were given ketamine or LSD or horse tranquiliser.  If they were given clozapine or chlorpromazine.  If they were given ECT.  If they had their nasal polyps removed..  A swizzle stick to the frontal lobes..  On the instructions of..  Of, um.  Uh.  Er...  I don't know if the DHB simply paid a foreigner not very much to get in there and have a go... Or if maybe the DHB didn't pay the foreigner anything at all.  If it was simply a way of management or administration taking the money out by passing various people off as clinical workers when the people passing themselves off as clinical workers paid and paid and paid and paid and paid the 'University' of Auckland and the royal australasian college of psychiatrists..  Paid and paid and paid and paid and paid...  What health system?  There really doesn't seem to be anything there, at all.  Can't even wont' even process applications to enrol in Medical Training.  Refusing to graduate people who have met requirements for the degree.  Will not pay people to work clinical jobs.  What health system?  F*cking scummy hoax of a f*cking scummy scam. There isn't anything there.  Won't do it.  Going to send Professor f*cking glue to go blackbirding for slaves...</p>

                            <p>____________</p>

                            <p>Amnesty International seems to have vanished from it's office on Karangahape Road / Queen Street.  I went in to speak to them about NZ Universities keeping slaves - refusing to get graduate studnets work out for external examination so as to extort more and more and more and more fees from them.  More and more and more money for visa processing etc etc.  They videoed me complaining.  Pretty sure.  Took me into a room and video recorded my complaint.  I suppose, then, that the recordings will also show what response I received, when I complained.  Silly silly silly girl.  Amnesty International doesn't have a presence in Auckland to hear complaints about how people are treated in NZ.  Amnesty International had a presence in Auckland only to hear complaints about how NZers are being treated *overseas*.  We don't know how lucky we are!  To have migrant workers here, working in Amnesty International Offices!  Videoing people who complain about NZ keeping slaves.  Refusing to pay workers.  Holding hostages.  Refusing to acknowledge work that people have done.  It doesn't cost them anything to print a meaningless piece of paper acknowledging that one applied to be enrolled in a 1 year research project -- and here, then, is the research that was produced within 1 year.  That's what it is or means to do a 1 year research project.  To do the f*cking project.  While they pretend to be too f*cking stupid to acknowledge the work that's been done.  So that all these people over 65 can take and take and take and take and take all this money to keep whole harems of dependents.  Doing all of the work for no pay.  Going away camping and housesitting for their supervisors.  Buying their supervisors birthday presents.  Throwing them parties.  Drinking with them etc etc...  What University?  Not even pretending to be a developed nation, hey.  There's nothing there ffs.  </p>

                            <p> https://www.nzherald.co.nz/travel/go-back-to-australia-expat-told-after-offensive-us-flag-tiktok-post/NXOWDA4MLJCPNOYQ2O64HXLFUY/  You need to get out a bit more away from the typical tourist routes to see the conferacy flags being flown.  That's why you see so many US flags.  Becuase of the number of confederacy flags that are still being flown.  The United States is not very united.  It's a propaganda campaign.  Nationalism.  Trying to present a United front.  Having things like sport and so on.  It's supposed to bring together people within the US and have them feel like they are on the same team rather than them feeling like they are part of a nation that is divided.  It is supposed to remind them that if they pull together then the United States would be the greatest country in the world.  It's the propaganda aspirational ideology campaign.  But it doesn't really catch on when people see how their applications aren't being processed and the corruption and so on.  They see the thin facade for what it is...  Not even trying to be fair, at all...  </p>
                           
                            <p>There is an age of retirement for civil servants / government employees.  Many of them were expedited into their payrolled positions on the basis of who their parents were, more than anything else, and they've had 45+ years of government payroll so they could keep entire harems of dependents.  And now it's time for them to retire.  Only, they won't get out.  How old is Justice Toogood?  Since when did reappointing a Judge who was past the age of retirement constitute a Judge having been appointment by proper process?  We are really expected to believe that abosolutely nobody else could have worked that job.  We'll need to blackbird for some foreigner to work it.  Lure them here under false pretences.  Get them to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for visa processing and moving expenses.  Then simply not pay them and awwwww.  What are they going to do about it?  Them and whose army?  How many 'medical doctors' are over the age of 65.  Still on government payroll.  They won't train anybody else, they won't register anybody else.  Mostly they don't actually know anything.  They were hurried into postition when they were 17 or 18.  Quickly quickly quickly before the people realise they don't know anything and they simply aren't that bright.  Get in there!  Have a go!  Abortions.  Euthanasia.  Arficial insemination.  Knock-out babies.  Gene studies.  Fixing up the nasal polyps (labotomies).  Electric stimulation to the genitals.  The babies in the incubators.  Experiments on oxygen deprivation and setting them up for a lifetime of 'I'm soooo lucky I'm a gamma baby I don't have to work half as hard as Ashley Bloomfield'...  The only game in town.  Can't even / won't even process applications for enrolment.  Won't acknowledge progression through training.  Can't even / won't even get work to external examiners.  What University?  What Health System?  What Judiciary?  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  There's really nothing there, hey.  All these people over 65 years on payroll and however many of the next generation expected to just f*ck off and die, then, so that the likes of Justice Toogood can have yet another day in court.  He can't even / won't even see anything wrong...  Poor Dr Leeks.  Poor Dr Green.  What they were doing wasn't any different or any worse than anything that everybody else on payroll was or is doing.  Right?  Poor poor them.  Best give them more and more government handouts to enable them to move someplace new and continue on with their crimes.  </p>

                            <p>The NZ government cries and cries and cries about how it doesn't have enough money.  But it refuses to collect taxes that every other nation collects.  Will not do it.  Insists on being a tax haven for all the criminals of the world.  That is the function of NZ.  Right?  To be a prison camp detention facility.  That always was the function of Australasia.  To be a destination location that was attractive to all the criminals of the northern hemisphere.  Try and lure them here all voluntary-like.  All the criminals of the northern hemisphere.  NZ and Australia doesn't need to train doctors or lawyers or engineers.  We can take the incompetent ones struck off for malpractice from the Northern Hemisphere.  America and England can threaten their students with being shipped to the colonies having to mind the gamma babies arranging for their overexposure to lead and so on so that Des can't see anything wrong you simply can't prooove that there is an association between exposure to lead and brain damage.  It isn't brain damage, anyway, Williams Syndrome is endemic and it's culturally normal for no attachment to a paraticular or specific individual to form and...  The dumb and dumber show.  The problem of evil.  Indeed.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  More than 45 years of government payroll.  Get the f*ck out.  Payroll stops.  Why is that so f*cking hard to understand?  Nobody home.  Nothing there, hey.</p>

                            <p>See the people they choose to fund..  What it is that they value.</p>
