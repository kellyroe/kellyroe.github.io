 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">

                            <p>  https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/131788981/can-one-less-student-make-a-difference-teachers-respond-to-smaller-classes  What?  You are going to actually acknowledge that certain people have completed their teacher training and you are actually going to payroll them to work as teachers?  God no.  That's now how it works.  You don't acknowledge that they have graduated and you record only ever increasing levels of debt against their name while you put them to work as unpaid student interns teachers aides teachers assistants while they pay the university they pay the university they pay the university they pay the university.  Paying teachers for having completed their teacher training?  That is not how we do.  There aren't enough teachers!  We will have to re-enrol and re-enrol and re-enrol and re-enrol people into teacher training (whether they apply to the programme or not -- right, Justice Toogood?  The University of Waikato can record that studnets (e.g., Kelly Roe) is enrolled in a program of study *even when the student never applied to be enrolled in that program of study*.  Send the bill to the IRD For student fees *for programmes of study that the student never even applied to be enrolled in*.  Right, Justice Toogood?  What education and training system...</p>

                            <p>  https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/300855134/god-help-us--waikato-hospital-short-40-nurses-for-one-shift  How many "healthcare assistants" were there?  How many students who were enrolled in nursing qualifications (who had been re-enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled in nursing qualifications because nobody is ever going to sign off on them having completed their nursing training) were in the hospital?  Nurses don't actually do any of the things that were mentioned in the article -- right?  Unpaid voluntary nursing students do those things in their role as "healthcare assistant" for low to no wages.  For decades..  Right?  You won't sign off on completion of their training because then they would leave.  Right?  Since you aren't going to pay them they would pack up and move someplace where they would be paid.  Australia, maybe.  Else (worst case) they would apply for paid work in NZ which would mean that some other nurses out there wouldn't get so much over-time.  Over-time pay.  And so on.  Wouldn't be such a small exclusive group anymore.  Wouldn't get to feel so...  Powerful.  It's a certain special type of power, I suppose.  Feeling like that's how valuable you are.  How scarce.  </p>

                            <p>That was something that many medical people say.  Those of them that were graduated, however many decades ago.  That they were very young indeed (early 20's) when they were graduated and shipped off to some rural community where they would be the only doctor in town.  Or sometimes some rural hospital where they may be the only doctor on during the night, or whatever.  So no supervision.  Just get in there and have a go.  And you make mistakes.  Of course you do.  And you have to live with that and those.  I guess many people burn out.  Those who don't burn out have come to terms with getting in there and having a go and so on.  And they are determined that insofar as they actually play a role in the training of the new generation they will be complicit in their crimes.  There is that, I suppose.  When various people have been..  YOu know..  NOt washing their hands properly for years.  Not getting informed consents.  Overmedicating their patients.  All those sorts or kinds of things.  THey will only sign off on a new generation who is similarly implicated.  They get them writing all about the atrocities they are required to perform during their training in their ethics class.  Don't they?  Documenting their own crimes...  To normalise it.  So the law courts can go 'this is just how we do.  This is the kiwi way.  Only game in town'.</p>





                            <p>Transgender Athletes</p>


                        <p>

                        “I’m pro transgender having their own class to compete in. I want them to win medals. I want them to participate in sport. I’ve got nothing against them. I’m pro biological women not having to compete against transgender [women]...  “I believe in supporting biological women … who aspire to win anything in sport. They will eventually lose everything to men wanting to be women.”  -- Dale Shephard.  NZ Powerlifter.  From:  https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/other-sports/300855409/governing-body-denies-male-powerlifter-entry-into-womens-competition</p>

                        <p>I'm not entirely sure about the 'men wanting to be women' characterisation...  But I agree with everything prior to that 100 per cent.  I was really really surprised to learn that Serena Williams wouldn't even be in the top 100 for tennis if there wasn't a womens's division, specifically.  If women who have gone through puberty as male (with male associated changes to bone density and frame and muscle mass) are directly competing against women who have gone through puberty as female (with associated changes to the shape of the pelvis and movement of bones and menstrual cycles) then it won't be very long at all before the transgender women are winning everything and displacing the females. </p>

                        <p>Once upon a time in the history of women's sport it was hard to get enough competitors for a competiton.  Maybe it is still the case.  Difficult for there to be weight class matched boxing or MMA or women's weightlifting events etc.  I reckon transgender athletes are in a similar position where we don't have transgender classes, yet, so that transgender athletes can compete against each other.  Maybe one day develop even to the point of when people transitioned, or whatever.  Different divisions.  To make things fairer.  More inclusive.  More of an interesting competition because things are evently matched.  A fair fight.  Do we still like for things to be fair?  Unclear...  I thought NZ was about the underdog but the attitude we get about the All Blacks being the best and that's why we love them seems to attest to otherwise.  People don't have a problem with jumping on the bandwagon of supporting the obvious winner.  I guess compensation for being kicked around so many other aspects or areas of life.  Have to take what you can get.  Sigh...</p>

                        <p>It is kind of interesting how different sports have gone different ways on it.  I guess in athletics and swimming there is recognition that puberty is really important.  Guys get a dramatic increase in performance.  Women don't.  They get worse for a time.  Many women feel demoralised over the drop in performance and drop out of sport altogether.  It sucks when you aren't as streamlined anymore because of your new shape.  It sucks when your pelvic bones start moving around so you have core instability and can't handle or drive your legs properly anymore.  Traditional ways of dealing with it were to starve them and put them on the pill and so on and keep training them as deficient boys, as much as you can...  Times are starting to change..  But, yeah...  </p>

                        

                            <p>______</p>

                            <p>Landon Watt in his capacity as legal advisor, office of the vice chancellor, university of auckland, informs me by email that the university of auckland spend $86,318.50 (including disbursements and GST) to hire external legal counsel for Roe v University of Auckland legal proceedings.</p>

                            <p>In the first case management conference for the above proceeding, Ms Roe pointed out to the 2 judges who were present that the Univesrity of Auckland had missed a filing deadline and she requested that judgment proceed in their absense.  That would  have saved the Univesrity $86,318.50 in legal fees.  The Judges who were present chose to grant the University an extension of time so that they could employ external counsel.  That was supposedly or apprently in the interests of Justice, the courts decided.  The courts decided to schedule a half day proceeding so that the University could asssert it's right to throw away applications from domestic adults even though the education and training act declares domestic adults to be eligible by statute.  The University published selection criterion (full time GPA, UMAT / UCAT Score, interview score) but refused to offer Ms Roe a place (or not) on the basis of her rank order score.  They said she was 'ineligible to have applied' and simply threw her application away. That was so that they could preferentially select teenagers and record levels of university debt against their name since the teenagers are entitlted to a secondary level education for free until they turn 20.  NZ doesn't have an education and training system.  Not even trying to be fair.  NZ doesn't have a functioning judiciary.  Not even trying to be fair.  Ms Roe doesn't 'get a discount on the amount awarded against her for Ms Roe being technincally right'.  Ms Roe is technically right in a technical matter of the University's decision to refuse to enrol her being ultra vires.  They were required to apply their published selection algorithm to her application and offer her enrolment if (and only if) her rank order score was high enough for selection.  They aren't being fair in how they are deciding who to enrol or not.  I don't know how much money people like Dr Leeks pay to do anything anything anything they like in our hospitals etc.  I would imagine considerably more than $86,318.50.  But the University behaving ultra vires has been upheld by the court.  The courts have chosen to give teeth to the Univesrity acting ultra vires.  What University?  What health system?  What education and training system?  What judiciary?  There's nothing here.</p>

                            <p>I am currently unemployed.  If you have a position suitable for someone with my level of education (you can see that I did the work for various qualifications whereas various other people on payroll didn't do the work for which they are paid - most minimally getting my reseach work out to externals so that they can sign off on completion fo my research qualification in a timely fashion).  https://www.payscale.com/research/NZ/Degree=Philosophiae_Doctor_(PhD)/Salary  Apparently NZ just keeps on needing to payroll new people from overeas (and people from NZ who didn't enrol in or do the work for these qualification) because they simply refuse to acknowledge the people in NZ who did apply to do the work and who did do the work.  Where is my government payroll?  Where is it?  Where is my money?  I was prepared to re-invest in further education..  But the government can't comprehend.  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camps.  Where is my money?  Only language y'all understand.</p>
                    
                        <p>These webpages document research that I have done for various Universities of NZ, Australia, USA.  Masters theses (MA and MPhil) and Doctoral thesis (PhD).  Also various graduate level course-work and write-ups of conference and seminar proceedings.  Articles.  A book chapter (co-authored).
                        </p>

                        <p>Much of that work that was given to supervisors and university admninistration was never sent out for external examination.  Supervisors didn't get comments back to me and didn't get it out to externals if they were too busy else lazy to do their job supervising me, so that externals could make concrete suggestions for changes else sign off that I had done enough for the 1 year masters or the 3 year doctoral programme that I had applied to be enrolled in.  The Universities kept recording re-enrolment and collect more and more money for keeping me re-enrolled.  Kept collecting more work from me.  Kept recording me as being re-enrolled.  The Universities aren't allowing externals to sign off on completion of research degrees.</p>

                        <p>I returned to New Zealand thinking that it didn't matter so much if the Australian National University wasn't going to send my thesis out for external examination, because I wanted to study Medicine and apparently it is competitive selection on the basis of full time GPA, primarily.  I thought with a GPA of excess 8.0 (actually 8.6 according to University of Auckland published criterion on how they will calculate it for the purposes of selection to Medicine) I had a pretty good chance.  But turns out that they aren't making decisions on the basis of GPA, at all.  They declared me 'ineligible to have applied' and they refused to correctly enter my GPA into their selection algorithm and offer me a place in the MBChB programme (or not) on the basis of my rank order score.</p>

                        <p>This website documents various cases that I have brought before the courts of New Zealand, therefore.  Auckland and Otago are not selecting people to MBChB on the basis of their academic GPA.  They are throwing away applications from domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years (who are eligible, by statute) in order to expediate selection of teenagers.</p>

                        <p>The statutory law of NZ says that NZ citizens are entitled to a free secondary school education until the age of 20.  When they turn 20 they are eligible to be enrolled in the tertiary programme they have applied to.  But the Universities are throwing away applications from domestic adults so they can record levels of debt against the name of the teenagers.  Often enrolling teenagers in only secondary level courses (partiuclarly in maths and science subjects at University).  Taking them out of secondary schooling in order to record levels of debt against their name.  Throwing away applications from domestic adults.</p>

                        <p>New Zealand is presently hearing cases of abuse in state care.  Not only are the courts delaying, but nobody in NZ seems interested, at all, in the selection practices that, for example, make Dr Leeks (and people like him) the only game in town.  Justice was not done for me in the various cases I brought before the High Court.  The Judges made errors of law (e.g., ignoring the TEC stating that 120 points of study = 1 EFTS of work = 1 academic year of work = 34 weeks enrolment including study breaks and the examination period).  The judges made errors of fact (e.g., I was eligible for enrolment so the university was required to process my application for enrolment according to their published criterion for selection whereby my GPA for the purposes of selection for MBChB was 8.6).  Justice Toogood was even pulled out of retirement (which is not proper process for appointing a judge) so as to refuse to uphold justice.  He is unwilling or unable to comprehend that the TEC states the enrolment period associated with the EFTS that the student has applied to be enrolled in and that that regulates what the University is allowed to charge to the studnets IRD for student loans for fees for having the student enrolled for however many years.  New Zealand is not keeping Universities.  New Zealand is not even trying to have a health system.  Apparently our health system is 'competitive'.  What is the aim of the competition?  To unlawfully detain in conditions of torture more people than any other nation in the world?  Or to pat ourselves on the back that we are doing better than Tonga?  They are not even trying to be fair.</p>

                        <p>Justice was not done in the High Court.  The Court of Appeal stated they required tens of thousands of dollars for the cases to go through the court of appeal.  They stated that the cases were all entirely particular and personal against me and not matters of public interest at all.  It isn't a matter of public interest that NZ Universities are keeping false records of student enrolment and false records of IRD debt.  It isn't a matter of public interest that NZ Universities are not getting research students work out for external examination.  That NZ Universities are not allowing external examiners to sign off on timely completion of graduate student research work.  It isn't a matter of public interest that Chris Whelan has not processed a single complaint of wrongdoing that he has received since he took up his position as head of the NZVCC in 2014.  It isn't a matter of public interest that Otago and Auckland Universities are throwing away applications to Medicine from domestic adults in order to ensure that Dr Leeks and people like him are the only game in town.  The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal's decision that these were not matters of public interest and that tens of thousands of dollars were required to be paid to the courts since Justice was not upheld in the High Court because of Judges that were not appointed by proper process precisely for the occasion.  The Social Security Appeals of Authority heard a case in late October and they still have not delivered Judgement on the case that was heard.  The Minister of Justice and Minister of the Courts say that it would be against independence of the Judiciary for the Ministers to remind them on expectations for timely Judgment delivery.</p>

                        <p>New Zealand is not keeping Universities.  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camps.  They record levels of debt against graduate research studnets name for enrolment periods the student never applied to.  They refuse to get the work out to externals.  New Zealand does not have a functioning health system.  They won't process applications to enrol.  They won't acknowledge progression through training.  They won't graduate people who have met requirements for Degree Completions.  They blackbird for slaves, only.  Chris Whelan and the like blackbird for slaves, only.  For a competitive health system where the aim seems to be to get unpaid volunteers to re-enrol and re-enrol and re-enrol in further training to unlawfully imprison and wrongful death as many people as they can get away with.  It's sooooooo competitive.  There's nothing here.</p>

                        <p>Apparently Ashley Bloomfield was appointed Professor for University of Auckland.  He never applied to PhD, never did the work for one, doesn't have any research output.  Apparently the reason they aren't signing off on (or allowing externals to sign off on) new graduates is because there won't be jobs for anybody else.  They'll pull Justice Toogood out of retirement (after he's been payrolled for more than 40  years) rather than appointing a new Judge.  Must keep the social hierarchy.  Apparently there will be jobs for new people only over the dead bodies of these people who were given governmernt jobs for life.  Many of them with tenured positions in the Universities and they have little to no research output to show for all of the government payroll that they have had in their life.  What do they do?  5,000 words of research every year they are paid to research at the University?  How many of them who actually claim research output of their own simply bully their students into fleeing so they can pass their work off as their own?  Give it to external examiners (who do not return it to the student - signifying that they accept the research) and then the University won't acknowledge the student has completed the qualification.  So that down the track other people can pass the students work off as their own.  Corruption.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                        <p>In some instances they aren't even grading the students work properly.  For example, they intentionally market the Public Health Degree Programme as one that is intended for students with a strong background in subjects like Arts and Law.  Then they say that actually it's intended as a 'first in family' Degree whereby it is intended that the graduates will consider themselves lucky to have been allowed to go to University and complete a Degree, at all.  The students aren't expected to be (are failed for) working to internationally accepted standards of scholarship.  Their work won't be assessed on academic merits, at all.  The tutors can write the essays for them else they can copy paste together the lecturers powerpoint slides else they'll be failed for the courses.  Fail anybody who can't / won't output work indistinguishable from the outputs of a computer programme.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                        <p>How many Medical Students did Dr Leeks bully into fleeing?  How many applications to Medicine does Professor Glue throw away so that he can keep up his Glue Factory as the Only Game in Town?  Nobody else need apply.  Nobody else will be graduated.  All of the money for him into perpeptuity.  All of the payroll for him and people like him.  It's sooooo competitive, apparently.  All of the payroll for him until the day that he dies.  </p>

                        <p>New Zealand does not have psychiatry.  Punative institution of abuse.  Not even trying to be theraputic.  Punative.  Abuse.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                        <p>Look at the calibre of the lawyers the NZ Universities chose to hire to defend their entitlement to throw away applications, to throw away research work, to refuse to allow externals to sign off on qualification completions.  They choose to hire senior partners of major firms.  That's the kind of thing that guilty people do.  That's taxpayers dollars they chose to spend defending their entitlement to not follow the statutory laws of NZ.  The courts gave Auckland University extension on their filings when I do not miss a single filing deadline.  They did not file their initial defense on time.  I requested that the courts allow things to proceed in their absense, therefore, but the courts asserted that 'that is not how we do things'.  Right.  So the University of Auckland spent how much money on hiring a partner of Bell Gully, then?  How much in court costs arose because of the courts decision to grant the Univesrity of Auckland etension of time so that they could pay laywers?  The courts do not function.  I wonder if it is because the Univesrity isnt' enrolling, progressing, graduating people from Law School.  What education and training system?  There's nothing here.  What health system?  What judiciary?  What skilled work?  Ashley needs hundreds and hundreds of thousands of tax payers dollars to pass himself off as a Professor, now?  Quickly quickly quickly tell all the graduates of Harvard to come here to do their knock-out gene studies  because nobody will be (and nobody ever was) prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus.  Apparently people can't be prosecuted for anything at all since Meredith Connell has the monopoly on prosecution and they are conflicted out from all the people who put a dollar in their private pockets.  There's nothing here.  </p>

                        <p>It is in the Australian Constitution that NZ is a State of the Federation of Australia.  Australia refuses to acknowledge this, though.  Refuses to supply voting papers to NZers to vote in Federal elections.  Refuses to pay Australian wages.  Refuses to supply Australaian birth certificates and passports.  The only leaders that internatinoal community will acknowledge as the leaders of NZ are ones who run this nation as a prison slave detention camp.  Blackbirding for slaves.  There's nothing here.</p>

                        <p>The Ombudsman delays things only.  Takes more than 1 year.  Anything the Ombudsman decides is not binding anyway.  Apparently it is all very very particular and very very personal how much money the University of Auckland chose to spend asserting their legal entitlement to throw away applications from domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years so as to preferentially select teenagers - many of whom have not finished all of what secondary levels of education are supposed to be offering them for free, in NZ.  Defending their entitlement to select students to Law and Medicine and so on on the basis of whatver they want.  With no accountabiltiy at all.  But still the University has not supplied the information to me as to how  much money the Senior Partner of Bell Gully made off of the University's decision to assert their entitlelment in court.  Whether it was pro bono work that she did in exchange for them still acknowledging her as a graduate of their University, or what.  It doesn't matter what the Ombudsman says, therefore.  Even when mostly what the Obmudsman says is that he is incapable or unwilling of seeing any wrong, at all.  It was very very personal and particular against Ms Roe, apparently.  It isn't sysematic or systemic that his is how people are treated in NZ.  Each and every complaint that Chris Whelan has received since he took up his office in 2014 has been thrown away (systemically and systematically) on the grounds that he has deemed the complaints to be all cases that are very very partiuclar and very very personal against the particular studnet.  All 'relationship problems' between the student and the only game in town that the University will employ to take all the money for doing little to no actual research work of their own.  That's why they pay them, seems to be the case.  To be a bully.  Take all the money out.  Only game in town.  There will be a job for their student only over their dead body, they claim.  They aren't even going to retire (e.g, Justice Toogood).  Only over their dead bodies can there be payrolls for anybody else.  Only game in town.</p>

                            https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/488062/teaching-hospitals-need-to-do-more-to-educate-about-consent-study  'It also found there was also a need to better advertise to patients that they were entering a teaching hospital and medical students would be part of their medical team.'  But they would only be part of their medical team -- if the patient consented for medical students to be part of the medical team. Isn't that what informed consent means?  That once you have been informed of something (e.g., that there are medical students wanting to practice playing doctors and nurses with you) that you have the right to say 'no, I don't want medical students to be part of my medical team'.  But why would our 'health system' listen to what the patients want?  Only Dr Leeks 2.0 need apply.  Only the best candidates for the next him will have their applications to medical school processed, at all.  The students need to get better at explaining to the patients how they have been volunteered for the only option that they have, whether they like it or not.  What health system?  Government institution of abuse.  There's nothing there.

                        <p>I applied to the ANU to do a PhD on informed consent and how Australasia doesn't seem to comprehend what it is.  To see how they would handle my application.  THey say that my application was 'incomplete' which is false.  Deny that I provided writing samples (you can see the writing samples for yourself on my writing page.  THey also had 3 writing samples on file for me already and a more than 100,000 word PhD that they never got out for external examination.  That's over on the writing page too in case you don't believe me.)  Interesting to see that they chose to falsely accuse me of an 'incomplete application' while subsequently funding was given to various other people to research informed consent.  I guess that's the point of collecting up research proposals.  So you can take the proposal and then give it to someone else.  Take my outputs and give them to someone else.  Pay other people hundreds of thousands of dollars for taking from me all of the work that I do.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                        <p>I guess the consoliation is that they will get sick one day and the special handpicked psychopaths can have their turn with them, then.  It's sooooooo competitive...  The supposed medical students who get in there and have a go at playing doctors and nurses without informing their patients of who they are, what they want to do, why they want to do it, what they will do with the results, what options the patient has..  THey will get sick.  Then their fellow medical student frenemies can practice on them.  Gnawing each others arms off it's soooooo competitive.  Only game in town.  What health system?  What education system?  There's nothing there.</p>
