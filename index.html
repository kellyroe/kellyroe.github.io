 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->

                            <article>

                                <p>I started this website so that I could upload some of the writing that I have done over the years.</p>

                                <p>It helps me keep track of where things are at with the court filings.</p>

                                <p>At this stage it is unclear whether any of the cases will be progressing through the court of appeal. </p>

                                <p>I know that when I read most judgments of the High Court I do not feel that justice has been done,  yet.  Mostly because things read (to me) like things aren't finished yet, things are still unsaid, but also because the court is bound by precedent and doesn't really have any teeth.  I am talking about how I feel when I read High Court Judgments about cases I know absolutely nothing else about.</p>
                                
                                <p>Court of Appeal judgments typically read much better.  But apparently most cases are abandoned before justice is done.  Presently the courts are trying to force me to abandon the cases by not accepting evidence I have supplied of my financial position.  They say my financial position is not relevant, they aren't progressing things becuase there aren't merits to the cases.  But the cases would be progressing, in fact, if I paid the fee, so it is not that things are not progressing because the cases lack merit.  Things are not progressing because I have not paid the fee.  Justice delayed is justice denied.  They are denying me justice, because I cannot pay a fee that they are demanding that I pay for things to progress through the courts.  They are trying to force me to abandon the proceedings.  I am not voluntarily abandoning proceedings.  This process does not seem very just.</p>
