                            <article>

                            <p>
                            This website documents some of the academic work that I did for New Zealand, Australian, and American Universities.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I have requested the Australian National University supply me with the documentation they have on what supervision Kim Sterelny and the Philosophy Programme of the Research School of Social Sciences offered me and explain why it was that they gave me extensions and yet refused to progress me through the qualification and refused to grant me my PhD.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I have documented, here the work that I did for the University of Waikato, subsequent to that where I wrote for them a 120 point MPhil Masters Thesis and they went on to refuse to get it to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit them signing off on completion of that Degree.  They went on to get it out late requesting it be examined for the wrong qualification (doctoral rather than masters examination so it would be found to be 'too short').  They refused to allow the overseas based external examiner to sign me off and they refused to schedule an oral examination when he asked for that after seeing they refused to sign me off themselves.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I have also documeted a similar process occurring in the Courts of New Zealand.  They do not accept filings, they will not progress filings, they order case management conferences where the Judges instruct filings to be changed into things that are less likely to win and they refuse to progress cases through the courts.  

                            <p>
                            Here are my submissions to the Court of Appeal regarding the University of Otago:

                                <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>.  I post them here because the Courts say I am out of time because I did not pay them $7,060 by the deadline they set.  I post them here so you can judge for yourself whether the courts have or have not upheld justice.
                                </p>

                                <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings on grounds that it had already passed judgment on the filings and would not revisit the issue.  They did not think my filings sufficient to show there had been a grotesque injustice.  I post them so you can judge for yourself.  
                                </p> 

                                <p>
                                 Here is why I believe that New Zealand is a State of Australia (it is written into the Australian Constitution): <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  They do not progress my submissions.
                                </p>  

                                <p>
                                The Universities of Otago and Auckland are not being fair as to how they are choosing what students to enrol in Medicine.  I have documented how Otago unlawfully discriminates against applicants on the basis of disability (they are blatant about that being what they are doing) and I have documented how Auckland refuses to apply their published algorithm to applications.  That means that Dr Leeks wasn't the product of a fair algorithm.  He was hand-picked for displaying the qualities they have chosen to value.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The Universities and courts have broken the social contract.  The Courts have chosen to set precedent that it will cost upwards of $20,000 to take a case against the Univesrity to the High COurt and the High Court will not uphold Justice.  
                                </p>

                                <p>New Zealand keeps detention / slave camps.  New Zealand is a state of Australia.  Australia chooses to supply New Zealand Dollars to New Zealanders to prevent them travelling domestically and to disguise how low the wages are kept in New Zealand.  They will not pay the teachers, police, nurses, etc.  They do not value the lives of New Zealanders.  They keep slave / dention camps.  They do not allow qualification progression and completion.  They are not fair in their allocation of training places.  They are not fair in their process of advertising (if they even do) or appointing people for paid jobs.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Dishonest people live there.  They lie to prospective migrants and then they don't pay them.  They arrange for them to be abused.  They don't honor their part of the contract.  They don't progress the work they don't acknowledge the work.  They are not supportive or encouraging.  They don't acknowledge people's humanity.  They don't see people.
                                </p>
                        

                                <p> I put in an application to do another PhD with the ANU.  When I applied I said I was not really interested in starting over, and was more interested in recieving credit for the work I had done for them already.  I wanted to study Medicine.  Only I wasn't sure if there was any Medicine because there isn't any respect, at all, for informed consent.  So, there aren't 'cervical examinations' there are 'sexual assaults' and there aren't 'surgeries' there are 'physical assaults' and so on.   Here is a link to what Sterelny had to say about the idea of me being credited with a PhD in Philosophy: <a href="judicial-review/kim.pdf" target="_self"> Not supportive. </a>  I guess things are sooooooooo competitive that the work I have published on this site is not even enough for a fully self-funded applicant to be accepted to even START a PhD.  Nasty piece of work.  There is a global shortage of psychiatrists and medical specialists but he won't even support me in training to do that.  And by support I mean for him to say something f*cking nice for a change.  Everybody is just waiting for him to die so that there can be some jobs for someone else.  But it is just so f*cking mean-spirited for him to prefer me to be kept or held or detained as slave.  Because he thought a good job for me was house-sitting for him and listenting to  him hanging off of his every word and sing sing singing his praises.  I wasn't allowed to work independently.  At least they took the journal off of him so that he doesn't get all the submissions for that anymore.  I wonder how many people he bullied into quitting the field entirely so he could incorporate their work into his own or give it to his friends.  I could not abide by the nasty in-group out-group mentality.  They don't have a research school anymore.  The people don't have healthcare because they choose to keep hostages.

                                There is no excuse for threats of violence -- but there are mitigating circumstances.  The Education and Training Act states that Tertiary Education is for people who have attained the age of 20 years, who are eligible to be enrolled in programmes they have applied to.  The Act grants New Zealand Universities discretion to enrol teenagers only when they are satisfied that the student is capable of completing the programme of study that they have enrolled them in.  People need to look very closely as to how it is that Otago chooses to enrol teenagers only to fail them out of the University.  It does not make Auckland and Otago better Universities that they abuse their students, so.  The University failed the student.  Two years in a row.  Then the Courts fail the student by showing there to be no justice within the legal system or courts of New Zealand.  They broke the social contract.  New Zealand:  Best place in the world in which to go to learn how to become a terrorist.  I thought that the graduation / commencement ceremonies were cancelled becuase none of the VCs felt safe showing their faces in public.  Because the Graduate Students (particularly) know, now, about their forced slave labor and exit payments etc.  I thought likely there weren't any graduate students they were graduating.  I have asked repeatedly for the physical shelves on which the theses are kept so I can see for myself the theses they have accepted in fulfilment of regulations for Degree (and their enrolment dates) but they say they hide them in storage...  They aren't Universities at all.  Not so far as I can see...
