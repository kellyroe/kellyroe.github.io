 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">

                            <p>I thought Una Jagose was standing down from her position after she testified to the courts about her role in concealing evidence and destroying evidence and asking for those things to be done so as to prevent and prohibit justice for vitims of abuse in state care.  Wasn't she going to stand down over that?  Or did we decide that we valued her far more than any of the victims so they could die so that she can keep on keeping her payroll year after year after year after year after year.  How much does she cost the taxpayers, again?  Wah wah wah wah wah we don't have any money to pay out the victims of state care.  Wah wah wah.  We don't collect tax from the weathy wah wah wah we don't have any money.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>
