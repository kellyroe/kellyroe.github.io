 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->

                            <article>

                                <p>Branches and beheadings...
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                I am very confused about how things seem to be with the education system, health system, and judiciary of New Zealand.   
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                It seems to me that the Universities of New Zealand are not functioning as Universities.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I think there are false assertions in the High Court Proceedings.  For example, that I attempted to complete a qualification under-time.  Firstly, a 120 point qualification involves a minimum enrolment period of 34 weeks (TEC).  Secondly, I don't think that undergraduates are failed for submitting their work or finishing an examination early.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                More problematic than this is that the High Courts seem willing to assert that the Universities are not required to supply applications to enrol or to process applications to enrol according to published criterion.  They can throw away applications for arbitrary reasons and they are not accountable to the courts for decisions they make about who to include and who to exclude from University study. They don't have to examine students work if they don't want to.  They are free to set domestic standards in excess of international standards including preventing externals from signing off on qualification completion by refusing to get the work out to externals.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I don't know why the courts would refuse to uphold the Education and Training Act.  I thought it was some kind of set-up to get things through the Court of Appeal but subsequently the Court of Appeal has deemed the proceedings abandoned because I was not able to pay them excess of $20,000 security for costs.  This decision was upheld by the Supreme Court of New Zealand.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I do not know why the judiciary of New Zealand would want to document that New Zealand is not rule by law because the Judiciary refuses to uphold the laws of New Zealand. 
                                </p>

                                <p>I do not know how anybody can do business in this Jurisdiction
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                It turns out that New Zealand hasn't been enrolling or progressing or graduating or employing Medical Doctors, really, at all.  And the Courts won't make them and the courts won't remove the people who are preventing and prohibiting the Universities from functioning as Universities etc.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                So, I don't really see how it is possible to function, here.  I don't know for how much longer the administration of New Zealand will be acknowledged by international community.  I don't know what will need to happen for the various offenders to cease and desist so that New Zealand can develop.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I am concerned that New Zealand might be (or might be becoming) something like the detention or slave camp of the world where the only people who are graduated or enrolled are people who bribe or cheat their way in.  That way the administration can feel entitlted to demand bribes later and then refuse to graduate or employ them since they are cheats.  I can't see anything other than an administration who wants control over people who have no option but to comply with their demands. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The ideology they would have us  believe is that you are required to pay to pay to pay to pay to pay to pay to pay excess.  Pay in bribes or pay in extra work.  Just keep paying just keep paying just keep paying just keep paying just keep paying.  You pay excess for visas and for entry and for sign off.  But why would they sign you off?  That's about time for you to be deported.  Drafted, maybe if you insist that you won't work without pay.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                They won't really pay teachers to teach at University.  It isn't about learning.  It is about detaining you for a length of time while you pay them you pay them you pay them you pay them you pay.  They can put you to work in your 'internship' and then, when it's time to graduate you it's time for you to go away.  Why would they pay you when they can replace you with people who pay them?
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                If they don't pay the teachers the teachers can get their pay selling the answers to the kids whose parents will pay them.  If they don't pay the ambulance drivers maybe they can hold people hostage in the back of the ambulance until the people pay them.  You pay them you pay them you pay them you pay.  I guess they only pay you if you bring them money because you find a way to make the people pay you they pay you they pay you they pay.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                If you don't buy in to this process of corruption well then I suppose it is time for you to give up and go away.  Just lie flat, or something.  Pay you in a few weeks months years decades generations of over-time.  Yeah, right.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I do not see that there is anything to see, in New Zealand.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I am waiting on the Australain National University to explain to me why my supervisor (Professor Kim Sterelny) did not get my work to externals if he was too busy or lazy to supervise me during my PhD.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I do not see that there is anything to see, in Australia.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The obvious place to start re: taxes.  The way 'clever' people think goes like this.  Study the laws in more developed nations (e.g, USA, Canada, Australia, UK) and see the things that you can't do there, that you can do, in New Zealand.  All of the things we haven't gotten around to banning yet because we don't have very many laws compared to those places.  The NZ Government refuses to update our laws so they are broadly in keeping with the laws of other nations.  Then they claim that they really can't see how to collect enough tax money to properly fund social services.  It isn't very clever, really.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I have writtten to both the Attorney General and the Solicitor General and they refuse to arrange for Government Prosecutors.  I have written to various Ministers including the Minister of Health and Education and Law.  I have written to the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition.  I have written to the Ombudsman.  The Privacy Commissioner.  The Health and Disability Commissioner.  Quite the mob seems to be converging on there being nothing that anybody can or will do about any of these things.  There really does not appear to be anything, in New Zealand. 
                                </p>

                                There is a wonderfully written series here:  https://www.newsroom.co.nz/ideasroom/anne-salmond-te-tiriti-and-democracy.  I am glad that it was written and published.  I don't know why my 120 point thesis of 2018 could not have been, as well.
