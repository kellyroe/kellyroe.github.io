 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                            <p>The Australian National University is not willing and / or able to supervise graduate research in philosophy.  They tell me they did not receive my research proposal (for any topic) from me, but there is no supervision available in the Philosophy Programme for 2022.  So, I suppose they didn't have any Philosophy students starting their PhD in 2022.  Else, they intend to refuse to provide supervision to those students.  They are done pretending to offer supervision to me.  Time to scammy scam some younger ones.  They like 'em young for the party party parties, you see.
                            </p>

                            <p>The writing page shows a 100,000 words + thesis that I provided to my supervisor, Kim Sterelny.  More than 10 years ago...  He still hasn't given me any concrete comments on it as to what I need to do before I should get it to the external examiners.  He hasn't told me that he has read it, yet.  He also hasn't told me that if I want to get a thesis to externals then it is despite him or in spite of him and not at all because of him.  Does it look to you like he helped me with the thesis?  He chose the topic for me.  The evolutionary aspect to cognitive breakdown.  I didn't really see how viewing the phenemonon as evolutionary (or as a matter of breakdown) was particularly useful or helpful.  But it was a topic of his choosing.  A topic he was apparently willing to supervise me on.  So, where is evidence of his helping, then?  Does it look like a thesis that was produced under Sterelny's supervision?  What do they pay him for?  All the teaching that he does?  No?  Waiting on you, Sterelny.  Any time you are ready to unpack your stuff and get to work. The job for which you are paid.  My ANU student records are full of people in the Philosophy Programme saying that they should get more money from the government to keep me enrolled as student.  They say that my progress as student is just fine.  Nearly a full draft.  A full draft.  They expect me to submit by a certain date.  But they never get the work that I have given them to the examiners and there won't be evience of them having helped me with it in their email outboxes.
                            </p>

                            <p>Here is a question for you.  Is a student supposed to write the thesis and then softbind the thesis and then submit the thesis for external examination to a timeline.  For example, if it is reasonable to expect to take 1 year for external examination (3 months followed by 6 months changes followed by 3 months external examination for a total of 12 months of examination) then submitting a 3 year PhD thesis at the end of the second year would be the way to go.  Or, is the student supposed to work to a timeline set by their supervisor where their supervisor tells them when they are ready to submit the thesis?  Are you supposed to get your supervisor nice and drunk and get them to sign off on your submission date in that way 'by agreement'?  How is it supposed to go, exactly?  What if your supervisor just says 'keeeeeeep working'?  
                            </p>

                            <p>Supervisors have (one would suppose of a premier research university like the Australian National University) had experience with supervising before.  So they have supervised PhD students before.  So they have some idea of how long various things take and some idea of a realistic timeline to completion.  But the PhD student has, typically, standardly usually, not written or worked on or submitted a PhD before.  Who is being employed to  help who?  Or is the job to prevent and prohibit and obstruct.  Maybe the student only gets their PhD when they kill their supervisor.  Maybe that is the idea.  Because it's soooooooooo competitive.  The supervisors go gunning for their students.  That's the nature of the competition.  Divide and conquer.  Here are the special students (set up as targets only to be hated by the other students).  Create dissent.  Division.  All very...  Motivational and inspirational.  Don't you want to join them?  Party party party.  There's nothing wrong with a good party...  But there is something wrong with being expected to party with your boss or your supervisor partiuclarly when they are not being professional with their professional duties or obligations when it comes to processing or progressing or assessing or helping you improve your work performance.  Telling you timeline information.  Who wants to party party party with Des?  18 year old applicants to medicine?  I'm sure there is a brilliant 14 year old out there who will do anything anything anything anything it's sooooooo competitive.  That is the concern about the party party party situation.  And that is the nature of the competition.  It must be soooooooo competitive such that they will do anything anything anything anything anything.  Just following orders, you see.  Anything anything anything.
                            </p>

                            <p>No?  Well..  Leave then.  Just drop all of your stuff.  Just  hand it over.  Give it to us.  Then turn and walk away.  Or curl up and die.  Whatever.  Thanks for playing.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Chloe says that education is a poverty trap -- but she doesn't know what education is.  Education is not a poverty trap.  Education is not a social mobiliser, either.  Education is learning about the world.  Teacher and supervisors are supposed to help the students.  They are supposed to have more knowledge and more experience then them so that they are in the position (knowledge-wise) to help them.  They are supposed to have the motivation and desire to help them.  They are paid to help them.  We don't have education in New Zealand.  We won't pay people to do that.  We pay people to prevent and prohibit people with the willingness and ability to do the job from doing the job.  We have a system of slave or prison or detention camps with the aim or goal of preventing and prohibiting social mobility.  We don't have an education system.  If you learn to read, write, do arithmetic.  Do calculus.  Learn Medicine.  It's all despite of or in spite of our 'education' institutions.  There's nothing there.  There's nobody home.  They wouldn't pay anybody to do the actual job.  The actual work.  There's just a bunch of people trying to keep slaves detained indefinately while teaching them nothing and not allowing them to do any work to the best of their ability to prevent and prohibit and obstruct that too.  It's soooo competitive.  The slaves will do anything anything anything.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            They won't pay anyone to work clinical jobs.  You pay the university or the polytech training system (they are still working on setting it up) so that the slave worker students will be put to work and the slave worker students will pay the university they will pay the university they will pay the university they will pay.  They will never stop paying.  They will never stop paying the university.  And the university (or the polytech) will put them to work in the name of their training programme.  And not write them references for the work that they have done.  Will bully them and tell them that they are incompetent and inept and they don't know anything.  Will say that this one or that one is special (so the other ones will turn against them because it's soooooooooooo competitive).  And they won't pay the doctors or the nurses or the teachers or the sterile supply technicians or anybody anybody anybody at all.  Unless you want to be one of them.  Of course.  Don't you want to be one of them?  Ensuring that there aren't any teachers or doctors or nurses or sterile supply tecnicians.  No lawyers.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing at all.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            We do pay high taxes in New Zealand.  It has been with the expectation of social services.  But the Government will not pay people to provide social services.  They won't pay the teachers or the doctors or the nurses or the sterile supply technicians.  You pay the university or the polytech system.  They refuse to sign off on your workplace internship completion.  They say you have to keep working your internship just keep doing your internship.  Just keep paying the university and also doing the work you pay your employer.  Didn't you know?  That's what work is or what work means.  You pay the university because they are your employer.  You are a student and whistleblower protections don't apply to students because they are not employers there are no employment laws for the slaves that are detained by the universities and training system that makes people pay only.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The government wants people to comply in this, that, and the other respect.  To sign off that this, that, and the other building is safe (e.g., not an earthquake risk, not a fire hazard) so that insurance companies will bear at least some of the cost of the rebuild.  And the like.  The government wants people to do what they are told when they are told because they are told.  The judges.  I would suppose.  Brian Tamaki needs to be in Mt Eden but Dr Leeks needs to go train some more students in Melbourne.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            All of the power and none of the accountability.  Nobody can function.  One of the most under-developed economies in the world.  Corruption.  They won't pay the workers.  And where does all the money go, then?  Who is getting all the money on the payroll?  People who refuse to perform their statutory functions.  Chris Whelan, still.  Refusing to process or progress any complaints of serious wrong-doing against the Universities of New Zealand.  He won't do it.  Will not do it.  I was confused a bit because OIA request from me said that he did not fly anywhere on the taxpayers dime.  But I was sure he was off blackbirding for studnets very regularly in South America and Vietnam and the like.  I suppose those trips are unrelated.  Do do remember reading abuot a...  14 year old finance graduate from AUT...  I suppose the 'minimum age' laws on Tertiary Education (16 since that is the age for consent and party party party we all know how you gotta love 'dem parties with the admin in order to have the possibility of a place at all).  I thought that was why the Auckland VC's University provided house had rooms for a basement-slave.  Party party party.  It's soooooooo competitive.  The kiddies will do anything anything anything anything anything.  Right?  That's the nature of the competition and why it is that the people with power are determined to make everything a great competition.
                            </p>


                            <p>The Tertiary Education Commission defines a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  
                            <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a>.  The writing tab shows that the University acknowledged having received my application to enrol in a 120 point MPhil with 05 March 2018 start date by their prescribed deadline.  The TEC approved the qualification as being 'right sized'.  They have the statutory function of approving qualifications and checking that the enrolment period (34 weeks) matches the FTE EFTS (1) also the points value (120).  But the University of Waikato is keeping records showing that they are not billing students in this manner, at all.  They have had every opportunity to correct their records and they refuse.  They instructed me to take them to court if I had a problem with their practices.  The courts have, thus far, refused to uphold justice.  International and domestic community need to be warned that they are lacking in honesty and integrity.  They are interested in closing ranks around their wrongs.  New Zealand isn't lacking skilled workforce or labor, at all.  New Zealand is a nasty little despot where the people with power refuse to allow other people to function.  Hostages.
                            </p>


                            <p>Here is how much the Inland Revenue now says I owe the New Zealand Government for my 'Education' and 'Training' that are not acknowledged because New Zealand qualifications apparently expire 5 years post-graduation (well, not the Judges law degrees, apparently, but my qualifications have expired): 
                            <a href="judicial-review/ird-shot.pdf" target="_self"> $104,663.</a>  You can see, then, that New Zealand does not appear to have functioning Universities, they appear to have detention or forced labor camps.  They won't progress or process academic work (particularly research).  They refuse to get official documents (theses submitted for examination) to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit external examiners signing off on qualification completions.  There is no skilled labor workforce, in New Zealand, because New Zealand has a series or system of forced labor detention camps only.  You pay the University you pay the University you pay the University you pay the University.  Maybe they put you to work as an actor playing the part of a skilled professional.  Then, when you are done paying them, your qualifications are withheld.  
                            </p>

                            
                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  They aren't progressing the filings. They are refusing to supply applications, refusing to process applications on their academic merits.  Apparently it isn't a matter of public interest how they pick and choose people to pass themsleves off as 'doctors' in our hospitals.
                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  Demanding me to pay more and more and more money to the courts else they force all my cases aborted, or abandoned.  <a href="judicial-review/sc-eyes.pdf" target="_self"> Here is the Judgement of the Supreme Court that I am attempting to appeal on the grounds that it is manifestly grotesquely unjust. </a>  It is like they have their eyes poked out.  Our highest court does not seem to have the conception of justice, at all.  It was the courts decision to delay Roe v University of Waikato proceedings until AFTER Roe v NZVCC and also until AFTER Roe v University of Auckland.  The Judge for Roe v NZVCC made all kinds of pronouncement in his judgment on the matter of Roe v University of Waikato.  That is to say instead of judging the issue he was supposed to be judging (the inaction of Chris Whelan in his capacity as CE of the NZVCC) he thought he would weigh in on whether or not I had done enough for completion of the MPhil Degree.  Clearly that is a matter of the Judge of a different case to decide!  
                            </p> 

                            <p>
                             <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  The Australian Constitution clearly names New Zealand as a state of Australia.  They say that they don't have to honor the constitution because New Zealand officials did not turn up to various things and they did not consent.  I don't know why Australia would care about consent in that instance.  Did they care about the consent of the Aboriginal people of Australia?  Did they care about consent of people to be immunised or subject to medical treatments or experimentation?  If they want to change the constitution then there is a process for it to be changed.  I think it involves a vote.  But New Zealanders don't get to vote so the Australian Government clearly does not care whether or not the people of New Zealand consent.  New Zealand functions as a detention camp of Australia.  But then, Australia still seems to govern like it is a detention camp of the Northern Hemisphere, so...
                            </p>

                            <p>Here are  <a href="judicial-review/sup-court-waikato.pdf" target="_self"> My Filings </a>to the Supreme Court regarding the University of Waikato    
                            </p>

                            <p>Una Jagose doesn't seem to have the job of instructing Crown Law to prosecute corruption within New Zealand Universities, or within the Judiciary (where judges refuse to accept evidence and where the supreme court punishes people for bringing injustices before the courts).  I suppose that is why they pay her more than half a million dollars to do that job.  They pay her to ensure the job is not done by anyone.  Not by her and not by anybody else.  The fact she is in the job prevents and prohibits the job being filled  by anyone with the willingness and ability to do the job.  It seems there is no evidence that they will accept that would attest to corruption.  None of the invoicing information that I provided (e.g., 0.5 EFTS = 120 points = 60 points = indefinate enrolment).  New Zealand does not appear to have a functioning judiciary.    <p> <a href="judicial-review/crown-law.pdf" target="_self"> Blow off response. </a>  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            <a href="judicial-review/adhbinterlocutory.pdf" target="_self"> My request for permission from the High Court to appeal their decision to award costs against me with respect to the ADHB having chosen to file motion to have my proceedings struck out rather than the ADHB having chosen to stop with involuntarily detaining people in conditions likey amounting to torture. </a>  That sounds confusing.  It all starts to sound confusing, doesn't it.  The gaslighting garbage output nonsense nonsene nonsense from the courts.  Denying the evidence.  Refusing to acknowledge the half of the laws that speak to the duties and responsiblities and actual job descriptions of the various government departments (e.g, the NZVCC and various of the Universities).  
                            </p>

                            <p>Australia now seems to have a case of the 'meeeeeeee toooooooooos'.  The 'metoo' in this part of the world is when the leadership sees a practice that is more depraved and deprivation inducing than the ones they currently have and they aspire to go even lower than lower than low.  They get all motivated and inspired at just how bad things can be..  And nothing will happen.  Right?  There will be no consequences.  Right?  Because it's hell on earth.  Right?  All the work that they do to bring it to  be.  Sooooooooooo competitive.  No education.  No justice.  No meaning.  No value.  Nothing.  Just a bunch of zombies following orders.  Which is fine.  No conscience.  When I grow up I want to be a...  Sophist.  No?  Psychopath?  Wrongful deathbringer?  Pedophile in the schools?  Sooooooo competitive...
                            </p>

                            <p>I don't see the pretty 14 year old girls turning up to play 'flight attendant' in the 'job fairs'.  But we see the face of unemployment, in NZ.  Oooooh no, the people turning up for the job fares already have jobs.  They are just looking for better offers.  And the people paid to do the deciding, well they don't see 14 year old girls to abuse.  So...  Bring on the cheap migrant slaves.  C'mon other countries.  You gotta have pretty young things you want to (effectively) sentance to death.  Right?  We will give them a 'job' in NZ.  Renowned the world over for fair wages for fair work (not).  Oh please sell your child into slavery to the NZ government.  We want someone to clean Chris Hipkins (minister of everything's) toilet.  Intergenerationally.  For less than minium wage.  Get a student to do it, right Chris?  The generations 50++ year PhD in cleaning your toilet for they pay the New Zealand Education System to do their 'workplace internship' in cleaning your toilet.  Intergenerationally.  For less than minimun wage.  No recourse for complaints.  Only a 'student' -- right?  Not even an employee.  A what now?  Don't you know how many generations of slavery are required for so much as minimum wage in New Zealand?  I mean...  People must be, like, 50 years +++ behind Chris Hipkins.  Who wears his intelligence and administration skills etc etc upon his sleeve.  Because they count the votes (yeah right).  When so many are kept in government institutions without so much as a post office box to their name.  Yeah, right.  All the work that goes into the prevention and prohibition of development...  The Harry Harlow Island Based Research Program.  They sold out the health of their people for what, now?  That's why we keep them the way that we do.  Of course.  All the honors and awards for the most esteemed Jacinda Ardern.  Her con-munications Degree from Waikato.  Then her PhD from Harvard in exchange for informing the graduating class how they were welcome to harvest their designer baby inplants from NZ without criminal sanctions.  Come get your designer babies.  The most designer baby of all being Angleman Syndrome Baby, of course, who (with the help of a little horse tranquiliser) will never  be able to object, protet, or complain how you choose to sexually and physically and psychologically abuse and torture them.  Of course.  The aim or purpose of Medicine.  To drug the non-consenting.  Because they have been consented.  What part of that is difficult?  The government decides what you voluntarily do.  From your education to your employment to your death.  Right?  Of course.  I mean, who did you think was the boss of you outside your workng hours.  Your what, now?  Party party party.  Who wants to party?  Anything anything anything it's soooooooooooooo competitive....  Yawn.
