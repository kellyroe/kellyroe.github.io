 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2023/01/alleged-fraudulent-auckland-university-graduate-practised-psychiatry-in-uk-for-19-years-court-hears.html</p>

                                <p>Likely they wouldn't have hired her at all if they didn't think that she was a fraud.  I would imagine that when you are keeping institutions that are not even pretending to be theraputic so that you can torture people, effectively, and keep them punatively in conditions the UN would likely say amount to torture, then you have a certain special kind of staffing problem.  Wouldn't you say?  How are you going to find people willing to commit atrocities?  Or, at the very very least, willing to turn a blind eye to atrocities being committed by others?  I would imagine that you would have to find people willing to do anything anything anything anything.  Really train them up.  Teach them all about 'the other' and how badly you will treat them if they don't comply.
                                </p>

                                <p>Why are they going after her now?  All of a sudden?  What happened for them to declare her to be a fraud now, all of a sudden?  Time for them to pay her, was it?</p>

                                <p>The Calendar Regulations say they can hold you back for 1  year (make you repeat 1 year) of Medical School.  It does not make sense, therefore, that she would have dropped Medicine entirely after being failed for 1 year of the course when repeating the year (so the University can get more fees from you) is something that they do.  In fact, Didn't 1/3rd (at least) of the Medical Cohort of University of Otago fail their internship which meant their Degree was withheld?  They had recieved signoff from their internship placement but the University didn't accept that it was sending them to placements that the University would acknowledge (accused them not of paying bribes for sign off but of not doing enough work even though they had been signed off).  They wanted them to take up their junior doctor positions in the NZ hosptials, anyway, but they weren't going to pay them their junior doctor salary.  THey were going to need to keep paying the university.</p>

                                <p>There aren't that many psychiatrists in the world.  If she was accepted to train as a psychiatrist in the UK and she practiced in fact it is disingenuous to think or say that nobody knew of her or remembered her as having failed out if she did fail out in fact.</p>

                                <p>They intentionally select criminals so that they don't pay them.  Then they move them around so that again, they don't pay them.  Also, the whole doing anything anything anything anything anything.  Keeping people in punative conditions of torture and so on and so forth.  Nobody there.  Nothing home.</p>

                                <p>The USA has STEP examinations.  STEP 1 is a basic science subject knowledge test of medical science.  STEP 2 is clinical subject knowledge test of medical science.  STEP 3 is a mock clinical examination.  So that they can ensure that they only take people who try and give sexual health examinations to the toddlers and who don't ask informed consent etc.  Whatever it is that they value for wherever it is they want to deploy 'medical workforce' to manage the prison and detention camps, I would suppose.  Check what they have to say about how to write up patient notes to limit health coverage and so on and so forth.  THe UK has something similar, I think.  They don't have the teaching materials that the USA does with respect to at least nominally pretending to have an actual curriculum and examination scores that are some indicator of the curriculum contents that were taught.  She would have passed those exams in order to practice in the UK at all?  And she would have practiced in the UK for a couple years before being selected to Psychiatry.  It really isn't plausible to think that when a place is thinking of hiring someone they don't get people to contact the Univeristy that the person is from.  I mean to say, Martin Davies wouldnt' write me a reference to study in the USA because he thought I'd make a  better slave for AUstralia and the USA could just take my work, my research outputs etc etc anyway.  I imagine.  ANd I imagine that Kim Sterelny wants me to go begging and pleading.  People will do anything anything anything anything.  Right?  I wasn't supplicant enough.  Following him around all day like a lost puppy begging him to read my work and do his f*cking job supervising or at least getting the work to externals.  You know how it goes, the slave or prison camp of Australia.  Apparently if Carl spent 2x the normal time doing a PhD -- but then he got a PhD.  Right?  And now he has paid employment?  So they just get you slaving for a while..  ANd eventually they do pay you.   Riiiight.  Suuuuure.  LIke how my doing what Waikato wanted and writing them 2x the thesis over 2x the years meant they recorded that I failed.  ANd they still haven't gotten around to recording me as having been enrolled in the course of study that I actually applied to.  In fact thehy have recorded me being enrolled in a course that isn't even listedn in the University Calendar and doesn't have sensible course-codes.  There are no enrolmetn dated associated with the enrolment.  Indefinite detention.  My student ID card haven'e even expired yet.  Look at the expiration dates on the University of Waikato studnet identification cards that hey give you when you enrol in a 1 year programme of study.  </p>

                                <p>Nobody home.  Nothing there.  Is she getting to testify about atrocities in the hospitals?  Why are they going after her *now*?</p>

                                <p>The 'Universities' of NZ (Haha) are wanting to keep online records only, now.  A potential employer is supposed to put in a records request with the University and the Univeristy will tell that prospective employer whatever they want about you.  SO, for instance, they can tell prospective employers that you are a nasty criminal degenerate if they want you to have no option but to stay and slave for them.  Why would they want to give up their slaves?  And the ones they want to get rid of..  Glowing references, I suppose.  Send off the problems, right? </p>

                                <p>How do you get signed off in NZ when the tutor is teachign you to grope people doing cardiac exams?  How do you get signed off in NZ when the tutor is teachign you to do cervical exams on patients anesthetised for unrelated procedures when they ahve not provided informed consent?  If they won't sign off on your committing atrocies (just like them) then how can you get your qualification from teh 'University'?  What Uniersity?  They are trying to keep more and more and more and more slaves and prisoners in the detention camps up and down the land..  What education and training system? What garduates?  What jobs?  There's nothing there...  Nobody home.</p>

                                <p>They wouldn't accept or acknoweldge when teh studnets had completed things to the satisfacation of international community.  Locally.  They won't accept it.  They say that their studnets are garbage garbage garbage garbage rubbish useless stupid lazy incompetent criminals.  Garbage garbage garbage.  Therefore they must be kept here as slaves.  Kept in teh prison detention camp because it's so fun to abuse them.  Garbage wasteland.  There's nothing here.  THere is nothing at all even trying ot be rehabiliattive or educational or healthy or helpful about any of this.  It's just soooooo cmopetitive.  Poking each others eyes out.  Soooooo cmopetitive.  Soooooo competitive.  Wehre does all the money go?  Of ocurse it's not really about money.  It's about power to do anything anything anything.  HOw some peopel need to feel big about themselves.</p>

                                <p>New Zealadn Universities won't even acknowledge their own qualifications.  So now, I suppose, what's happening is that all the NZ graduates in the world can be recalled to NZ.  Their qualifiations rescinded or taken away.  No longer acknowledged.  The world won't accept NZ qualifications because NZ wont' even accept NZ qualifications.  There's nobody home.  Nothing here.  They dont' have curriculum contents for the exams they have for studnets to go into training places for the specialist colleges.  If I wanted to be a GP then how would I go about being selected for training?  What study materials are there?  What curriculum contents?  USMLE study books?  World question bank questions?  What curriculum contents are there in Australasia?  How do you study for exams?  What's that?  YOu suck their dicks all day.  You suck their dicks all day>  You suck their dicks all day and maybe they choose you!  For whatever arbitrary personal non-professional reasons that they have.  They jsut choose you!  How to staff the prison slave detention camps.  Quite the conundrum.  </p>

                                <p>Not even trying to be any different / any better.  Will not train a workforce.  Takes the people struck off from everywhere else.  The criminals etc etc from overseas.  Takes them so it can pass them off for a time and then refuse to pay them.  Say they are criminals and frauds.  The Waikato hospital has on at least 2 occasions hd articles in the Waikatko Times about them finding our or declaring that someone on payroll as psychiatrist is delcared a fraud.  One of them was apparently an impersonator who never went to medical school or did any training at all. And apparently nobody could tell that he hadn't done any training at all.  Nobody could tell.  I guess that tells you something about the quality of our training system.  WHen tehy can't tell the difference  between a graduate from a NZ University (yeah right) and a fraud from overseas.  The great fraud upon all of the people.  WEe don't have an education and ttraining system.  There isn't any point studying because they don't examine things fairly.  They won't do it.  THey are only interested in keeping slaves.</p>

                                <p>It's great, hey.  People would rather employ criminals and violent offenders and fraudsters and so on from overseas..  Than allow the likes of me to do it.  The choices the people in power make, hey.  What it is that htey value.  They would rather have criminals come here from overseas and throw all of the NZ qualifictions away.  I don't see how we can colelct up money from international studnets.  We aren't processing applciations, progresseions, completions.  We don't acknowledge our own qualifications.  There's really nobody home. Nothing there.  NZ Universities looks at what people are saying about how China is treating the Uyghur in the prison camps in the name of education and training and goes 'we dont' see anyting worng with that it isnt' anything that we are not doing'.  New Zealand...  One of the worst places in teh world in which to have a child or raise a family.  The rates of bullying and violence and abuse and use of force.  People don't feel heard or listened to.  The government treats the people like animals.  Keeps them as slaves.  There's nothign here.  Nobody home.  There is no process of decolonisation.  It's Stanford Prison Experimetn.  Harrry Harlow's Primate Research Laboratory on the nature of hate I mean love I mean helping me helping me helping me help myself to you.  THere's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>Now everybody stop for a moment.  Let's just take a minute...  To celebrate Harlene Hayes!  She was promoted to the 'University' of Western Australia to expediate the selection of 18 year old teenagers into the 'Medical Programme' (yeah right) over there.  But only after she recorded that 1/3rd the Medical Cohort of Otago was having their qualifications withheld because the Univesrity did not acknoweldge the internships that the University had set up for them to go on.  I don't know how many of the students who stayed in NZ to do local internships also had their qualifications withheld.  I would imagine that anybody notn willing to commiit Dr Leeks or Dr Green sorts or kinds or types of atrocities would no longer be welcome to do Medicien in NZ. And I really can't imaagien that they are giong to pay anybody for committing atrocites. That's the kind of thing that people pay you for the privalede of.  Right?  They will need to figure out their own way to make money off of the victims in the 'hospitals'.</p>

                                <p>Let's all take a moment to revere teh right honorable Dr Leeks.  And, of course, a moment to reflect upon the qualifications and credentials of Ashley Bloomfield, recently made PRofessor of the Univesrity of Auckland.  He is a Dr in virtue of having graduated (they say he graduated -- but the Medical Profession won't register him to work with patients?) the Medical Programme.  That's an undergraduate level degree.  THey won't let you live in graduate student accommodation because they say it's an undergraduate level degree.  He is not a 'doctor' because he did a PhD or an MD. He doesn't have research, teaching, tutoring, grading expereince.  He has experience of ordering the nation to an unlawful lockdown where the courts say that he can do anything anything anyting.  So he's professor now.  That's what it means to be professor in NZ.  They chose him!  Not because he did his job..  Even...  But because they like and value him.  Revere him as a God, even.  Most strange...</p>

                                <p>That's kind of why I genuinely don't understand why Auckland didn't just enrol me in MBChB.  What is to stop them simply flunking me out, like they did for Population Health 101?  Just saying that I failed?  Of course, you probably want to get people taking the maximum time first (paying maximum fees).  That would be 7 years of fees to do the 6 year programme?  The Calendar says they can get to to repeat one year.  But then, I guess, the idea is that they will say that they will fail you out of the qualification entirely unless you bring your performance up and that's going to necessitate you paying an awful lot of money for private tuition or whatever offered by the Univerity or place like Crimson Education (blood on their hands, for sure).  It's quite the scummy scam.  Just so that New Zealanders and Australians also can understand the reasons why they don't have access to timely quality medical care.  It's because of the Governments preference for bullying and abusing and keeping slaves.  Keeping the people detained in conditions of torture and so on.  It's just so fun to play Stanford Prison Experiment.  It's sooooo competitive!  And if you don't want to play guard (and bully and abuse and eliminate and so on) then you can be our favorite detainee, then!  There aren't any doctors or teachers or professors or anything really anything at all because of the psychoapths who are having so very much fun of the eway things are.  They won't allow things to be any other way.  Don't worry..  THey get sick eventually.  Their nasty bruitish and short little lives will be over.  But not  because they've made things as bad as they can for everybody else along the way.</p>
