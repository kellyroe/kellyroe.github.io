			<h1>Kelly Alexandra Roe</h1>

		<p>Last updated:  YYYY-MM-DD:  2025-12-15.</p>
		
		<p>I set up this website in the context of learning how to get .html and .pdf content publically viewable on the internet.</p>

		<p>I was also learning about and experimenting with features such as versioning and documenting submission dates or pull requests.</p>

		<p>- I am not intending to build or ship software.</p>

		<p>- I did / do not intend to publish source documents (e.g., .tex files).</p>

		<p>As such, I have built a website over there: <a href="https://kellyroe.org">https://kellyroe.org</a></p>

		<p>I have deleted the 'publish' folder on this site.</p>

		<p>If you have a broken link (e.g., https://kellyroe.github.io/publish/readme.pdf) then try the corresponding link over there (e.g., https://kellyroe.org/publish/readme.pdf)</p>
