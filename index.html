                                <a href="https://kellyroe.github.io/writing/realmecv.pdf">Chronological CV</a>
                                There is a link to my CV that I have presently under consideration for various things.
                             </p>

                             <p>I will try not to do  anything to break the links while I update contents.  I am in the process of file re-formatting and reorganising my work. </p>

                             <p>Have I done enough for a PhD?  How many years is it supposed to take, again?  Before they, you know, they pay you.  We are supposed to believe that Jacinda Ardern gets honorary qualifications and honorary fellowships becuase she's going to write a book one day (after completing a 3 year undergraduate degree from Waikato) whereas I haven't done enough?  We are supposed to believe that Ashley Bloomfield gets appointed to Professor of Public Health when he never applied to do a M.D or PhD, never did the work for one.  He doesn't have any research output.  What Universities?  There doesn't seem to be anything there.</p>

                             <p>
                              https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/504035/student-hunger-bad-teachers-revealed-in-latest-pisa-tests-showing-dip-in-nz-teens-scores  New Zealand students don't care about studying or working hard.  Because they don't pay you, they don't pay you, they won't pay you, they won't pay you.  They won't let you sit the exams, but even if you did they wouldn't grade them properly.  They won't graduate people who have done the work.  They won't even process applications to enrol.  There's  nothing there ffs.  They aren't even trying to be fair, at all.   
                             </p>

                             <p>Work hard to get into `University' everybody.  Justice Toogood (pulled out of retirement for the occasion  because that's the proper process for appointing judges) ruled that he couldn't see anything wrong with the `Univesrity' of Waikato recording that I was enrolled in a MPhil Programme in 2019 when *I never applied to be enrolled with the `University' of Waikato in 2019.  I mean to say that you don't even need to apply to be enrolled in `University' in order for the `University' to arrange for debt to be recorded against your name with the IRD.  Didn't you know?  WOrk hard to go to `University' everybody!  Why not record that everybody is re re re re re enrolled with the `University'.  That way you will never need to pay anybody at all!  THey can just stay in the student slums indefinately handing over more and more and more work for the people already on payroll to reattribute to other people already on payroll.  They aren't going to retire.  Not voluntarily.  Jobs for other people only over their dead bodies, apparently. They would have for things to be no other way.  F*cking psychopaths.  F*cking psychotics.  There's nothing there.</p>

                             <p>It's a f*cking farce of a f*ckign joke of a f*cking scummy scam.  There's nothing there.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                             <p>We don't have teachers and nurses and doctors etc  becuase we won't pay them.  Nobody is allowed to work those jobs.  They won't pay anybody to do themm.  No shortage of unpaid slaves to pass themselves off, as.  If it's really sooooo competitive to do medicine then why do they need to spend so much money exporting Shortland Street to the world to teach the migrant slaves how to comport themselves in NZ hospitals.  Come to NZ, everybody!  Play school.  Do all of the work for none of the wages.  Don't forget to re re re re re re apply for visa re re re re processing, everybody.  We won't pay the workers.  There's no workers, here.  Nobody has any qualifications.  There's nothing here.  ALl of the jobs for Ashley, therefore!  I'm soooo glad I'm a gamma baby, I don't have to get paid half as much as Ashley.  Ffs.  The F*cking psychopaths.  Right, Sterelny?  You managed to take out your f*cking pen and arrange for a meeting with the studnet you are supposed to be supervising, yet?  How many words per year was that?  For how many years?  You f*cking psychopath.  Is it f*cking well dead yet?  There's nothing there.  Go to University (`University') to eat your lunch with Sterelny, everybody.  What a f*cking farce of a f*cking hoax of a f*cking joke.  Mate.  F*cking hell.  There's nothing there.</p>

                             <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/504071/woman-vindicated-after-high-court-rules-family-court-judge-made-mistakes  Aw, come, now.  That was good playing judge -- wasn't it?  That's what it is or means to be judge.  Surely.  Clearly.  You can comport yourself however you like.  What are they going to do remove you from office?  Lol.  That's archaic!  Obsolete!  What judge is going to rule that!  That's why all the f*cking retarded children want to be judge!  Whey they want to preside over their peers in mooting competitions after running around naked at Kiola...  No..  That wasn't it..  After running around naked at Law Camp.  Obviously.  Soooo important for your career.  What a f*cking farce of a f*cking hoax of a f*cking scummy scam.  Not even trying to be fair.  There's nothing there.  </p>

                             <p>Oh it's sooooo competitive, to get into Medical School, in New Zealand.  It's really competitive entry on the basis of GPA (not even a little bit).  They will not process the applications.  There's nothing there.  Nobody home.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  Dr Leeks was the only game in town.  Everybody else's application was thrown away.  Everything it is that we value.  There's nothing there.  What health system?  It's sooooo competitive!  How many people (sorry, `people') can we kill today?  </p>

                                <p>`Disability and equity for medicine and public health' was a 120 point 1 EFT thesis (the TEC says that's 34 weeks including the external examination process which can take up to 3 months so you do the math on when it needs to be sent out for external examination by the `Univesrity') that was written in 2018.  It was BEFORE Covid.  Before, you know, this disease comes along that happens to result in a lot of young fit healthy people dying -- about when it's time for us to pay them.  No graduations.  No workplace internships as a requirement for graduation.  No employment.  Time to die.  Now it's time for us to pay you.  There will be a job for you only over our dead body.  What disease do you know that targets people when it's about time for us to pay them?  Doesn't go after the vulnerable.  The very old or the very young like diseases typically tend to.  Goes after people when it's time for us to pay them.  Time to pay.  Time to pay.  Time to pay.  Can't do / won't do share.  Only over our dead bodies.  Time to f*cking well die, therefore.  Retire already.  Into the aged care institutions you made for other people to die in.  Off you go, now.  The euthanasia shots you arranged for.  The shots you arranged for.  The government will tell you what shots are right for you.  All voluntarily-like.  You have been volunteered.  What's so f*cking hard to understand?  Time's up.  Time for someone else to have a f*cking turn.  F*cking psychopaths.  </p>

                                <p>Professor Glue's Glue Factory is the only game in town for NZ.  Nobody else need apply to do Psychiatry in NZ.  Dr Leeks was trafficked around NZ and Australia -- they moved him to Melbourne and enabled him to further continue on with his ongoing crimes.  For everything it is that they value.  One can only suppose.  Most valued.  MOst valuable.  How many people did he select to be his studnets?  To teach them everything he knew?  How many did he graduate?  How many did he bully into leaving `Medicine' altogether?  There's nothing there ffs.  They won't process applications to enrol according to the criterion they publish precisely for that purpose.  There's nothing there ffs.  Psychopaths -- right Sterelny?  Just not behaviourally modern.  There's nothing there.  Not even trying to be fair.  No justice.  No meaning.  No value.  No values.  Nothing.  No people.  What people do you see?  Just however many slaves to take and take and take and take and take from.  F*cking psychopath.  F*cking psychotic.  World leading ideology!  Travel from the northern hemisphere to eat your lunch with Sterelny, everybody!  Living the dream right there!  F*cking psychopath.  Get out already.  F*cking hell.  Mate.  F*cking psychotics.</p>
