 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>After all the work that Helen Clarke did ensuring that New Zealand was the *go to* the real *destination* place for child abuse she is very well regarded internationally, we are supposed to believe.  So, I'm sure Jacinda Ardern won't have any trouble at all being well regarded for all the work she did passing various laws (in the stealth of the night) under urgency!  emergency!  urgency!  Good of her to let the people of Harvard know about the legalisation of abortion in New Zealand (not too hard for them to look up how nobody was ever prosecuted for having performed one even when it was a crime).  That way New Zealand can be a destination for anybody wanting to 'research' or, more to the point, breed an underclass.  Nobody, to the  best of my knowledge has ever been trying to breed an over-class or a superman race or anything like that.  People don't desire to make something better than themself.  They are more interested in breeding an underclass of underlings.  Real knock-outs.  To see what will happen, if nothing else.  To create something relatively simple that only they can fix, in the best case scenario.  Right?  Breed an antibiotic resistent bacteria that only you have the cure for?  Right?  Hold the world to ransom?  Who wouldn't want that?  If only they could get away with it!  It's the very definition of 'win-win'.  Right?</p>

                                <p>I suppose the idea is to do the whole 'how low can we go' and 'there is no alternative' to see how few votes they can actually get.  While still telling the world that this prison camp is pretending to be a 'democracy'.  The little prison island off the coast of Australia (don't worry, the Australian Constitution doesn't apply to Australia it's all entirely optional they get to pick and choose which parts they want to honor and they don't feel like acknowledging NZ as a state of Australia therefore no voting papers for the NZers.  They wouldn't vote anyway.  Right?  I mean they have this 'option' and that 'option'.  It's like 'my way' or 'the highway'.  It's like 'do you want to eat your vegetables before your meat or after you meat?'  You want your euthanasia shot (all voluntary-like) now, or a little bit later?  Your taser to the brain now, or tomorrow?  You want to march off to the death camp by yourself or you want us to get a court order?  You want to stop campaigning for election or go to Mt Eden?  You want to spread your legs for Chris Hipkins, Minister of everything?  Or you want to vote for the party who thought that there was no better candidate than Uffindell?  Oh me oh my the 'choices' we have in 'you have been volunterred' land.</p>

                                <p>I don't know if Jacinda's response to the Christchurch Terrorist attack was scriped by her -- or someone else.  It was a good response.  In the short term.  Of course when it came to a more systematic or systemic or sustained response..  Providing better support for refugees and so on...  That was not forthcoming.  Then the idea seemed to be..  How can we make or find or breed more of them? Terrorists.  Because they make the politicians look good.  Right?  What's that Biden?  After a kid shoots up a school everybody in the neighbourhood will cue up for hours and hours and hours to shake your hand and listen in rapt awe for a compassionate speech from you.  I see why leaders of nations can be or become very addicted to having their population or people kept in a fairly permanent and ongoing state of trauma and shock and urgency!  urgency!  it's an emergency!  no time to think or plan (no accountabiltiy later we were only doing the best we could under conditions of urgency emergency) no time to actually listen just roll out whatever you want as quickly as you can...  Urgency!  emergency!  quicklky quickly quickly!  New Zealand has never met the quota that we are supposed to meet on refugees.  Correct?  Never?  But, of course, we rely on Australia to ship the ones of Australia's choosing.  Us being a state of Australia, and all.  A prison camp of Australia no less.  Because that's how they choose to govern Australasian lands, as best as I can see.  It takes the rocks from out of the ground and it hands them over.  It doesn't have the willingness or ability to educate or train anybody in anything at all.  Cry cry cry cry cry for satellites and submarines...  Just hand the intellectual property over...  Nothing to see here, people, nothing nothing nothing at all.  What people?  Why would we think they would count the vote?  There is no alternative...  They stopped paying the teachers.  They stopped graduating people from Uni.  They stopped paying people to work skilled jobs.  Only criminals and offenders from teh northern hemisphere need apply.  Most valued.  Then we don't pay them.  They can pay us they can pay us they can pay us they can pay us.  So many jobs simply pay for themselves.  Once you make money on pimping the kids out.  Etc.  Don't forget to spread your legs for the Rt Hon Chris Hipkins!  Minister of everything!  A man with a vision.  The pipeline from education prison to quarantine prison.  Even health prison. It's all the same, right Chris?  Urgency.  Urgency.  Emergency.  Allll of the portfolios for you Chris.  Only game in town.</p>

                                <p>The worst thing about the Australian National University (and the Univeristy of Waikato's aspirational ideal to be a second rate imitator) isn't how they treated me, at the time.  Refusing to acknowledge my work.  Refusing to get it to externals so as to prevent and prohibit timely completion of graduate research.  The worst of it is how they choose to treat me now.  Today.</p>

                                <p>They refuse to accept that I have laid a complaint with them.  They just refuse to accept it.  The Australian National University says 'in order for you to lodge a complaint you need to do x and y and z'.  They just make up stuff.  And then, when you do what they tell you to do, they deny that you have done it.  Revise and resubmit your complaint, Ms Roe.  We don't accept your complaint Ms Roe.  Revise and resubmit your complaint Ms Roe.  How many complaints do they receive?  Let me guess, sinc Chris Whelan's job (as CE of the NZVCC) is obviously and clearly to ensure that New Zealand Universities are second rate imitators of Australian Universities and since Chris Whelan refuses to acknowledge that he has received any complaints (when his statutory function is to progress complaints) they probably say they have never ever ever ever ever received a single complaint from a student about the University's refusal to process or misprocessing of research.  </p>

                                <p>The Vice Chancellor of the Australian National University was informed.  He kept telling me that I needed to complain to x or y or z person.  I mean to say the buck stops with him.  It wasn't that he intentionally employed underlings incapable of doing their job and he is ignorant of the complaints they have recieved.  He received my complaint and he chose to blow me off.  </p>

                                <p>What is the problem?  The problem is that they are not properly handling (1) enrolments (2) progressions (3) completions of graduate research (also likely undergraduate) qualifications.  THey will not do their job of supervising grduate research students (helping them get their thesis done in a timely fashion).  They think their job is to stabotage and undermine and so on.  Then they don't get the studnets research out for external examiantion.  They bully the studnet into doing a lot of work in excess of the requirements for the qualification.  I thought it was limited to heavy handed bullying.  But my experience with the Univesrity of Waikato shows everyone the lengths they will go to if you don't do what they are trying to bully you into doing.  I meant to say, they went to far as to deny that I had shipped them a thesis I have track and trace signed delivery evidence of them having received, and to refuse to get the theis they had been shipped out for external examiantion.  To this day, they never sent the thesis of 14 September 2018 out to external examiners for it to be externally examined so as to prevent any possibility of the examiners signing that it was to be accepted which would have meant I would have completed the 120 point qualification without re-enrolment being required.</p>

                                <p>During the relatively early years of lockdown (Maybe it was 2019 or 2020) the students in England (who were preparing to sit their Cambridge Exams) were told that they likely wouldn't get to sit the exams. The studnets were distraught.  Their selection into University was dependent on their examination performance, they had been led to believe.  That was why they were paying however much money they were paying to sit the examinations.  That was why some of them were workign so hard on learning curriculum contents.  Oh, don't worry, the University people said.  We already know who is going to be sent offers and that is quite indepndent from examination scores.  We don't need the examination scores to know which students we prefer.  It doesn't upset anything at all that the kids can't sit their Cambridge Exams this year.  In fact, we can simply allocate high Cambridge Exam scores to the people we have already selected for this and that University, and lower ones to the people we have selected for this other University, and you don't need to sit your exams at all!</p>

                                <p>Who wants to pay money to sit Cambridge Exams?  Now, that appears to be a system with integrity.  In upside down and back to front land.  Wouldn't you say? </p>

                                <p>So you can understand that when the University of Auckland and Otago say you haven't been selected to Medicine because you rank order score was not high enough..  What they mean to say was that they did not choose you therefore they bumped you down the rank order score.  Or, if they couldn't bump you down the rank order score enough (because they don't have enoguh control over the rank order scores with their control over the interview which apparently gives them the power of 'definite no' or 'definite yes' according to Peter Crampton and friends in print) then they can simply throw away your application and say you were declared 'ineligible' (that's what in fact Peter Crampton and friends were doing with them).  Else they can simply refuse to supply you with an application.  Get Andrea Howard to refuse to supply one.  Tell the IT people to lock certain candidates out of being able to submit an application to ensure that they do not get selected.  I can't see why they would need to remove applications if they were not...  Afraid?  That the applicant was a genuine contender.  That doesn't really make any sense now, does it?</p>

                                <p>The University of Auckland told me I was not accepted to study Medicine in 2019 because my rank order score was not high enough for me to be selected.  That is what they chose to tell me.  With a little note that they suggest I get support for my mental health since it must be very upsetting to me to learn I wasnt' academically strong enough.  When I asked them to check their math because I believe they made a mistake they supplied information to me as to how they had calculated my GPA.  I informed them that the way they calculated it was different from how they had published that they were going to calcualate GPA's.  In particular, they had used 'worst 120 points of study' in a year when they promised to use the 'best 120 points of study' if you did more than 120 points in a year (including summer school papers above stage one) and they used a part time year instead of the most recent full time year.  I mean to say, if you record that a 120 point Masters thesis took 2 academic years and 1 summer school period of enrolment, then you have in fact forced the student into less than 120 points credit over the first year in order for there to be any points remaining to distribute over the summer school and second academic year enrolment period.  They eventually agreed that they way tehy calculated it was not in accordance with their algorithm.  I supplied them with a calculation that was in accordance with their algorithm and they said that it didn't matter because they declared me 'ineligible to have applied'</p>

                                <p>I mean to say that the University of Auckland is not making decisions about who to enrol (and who not to enrol) in MBChB on academic grounds, at all.  They are not at all being fair.  They are refusing to calculte GPA's in accordance with their published algorithm at all.  They are not even trying to be fair.  What is worse is that they refused to sort this out in house.  They had plenty of time and opportunity to correct their wrong and offer me enrolment.  But they refused to do that, instead sending offers to other candidates.  They then refused to do things properly again in 2020 and decided to spend a bunch of money hiring a law firm to defend their inability or unwillingness to follow their published selection criterion for the purposes of their accountability with the courts after their in house counsel missed a filing deadline and I requested judgment proceed in their absence.  The courts chose to grant them extensions so they could get an external firm to do their filings properly.  So far the courts have delivered the judgment that the University of Auckland can do whatever it wants with complete and utter immunity.  They aren't responsble for anything or accountable for anything.  Justice Fitzgerald found that Auckland does not have the power to deem applicants 'ineligible' since the Statute says that domestic adults are 'eligible'.  But she provided no consequences for them having deemed me 'ineligible' when tehy did not have authority to do that.  And she failed to order them to calculate my GPA in accordance with the algorithm and enrol me in teh progamme (or not) on the basis of my correctly calculted rank order score.  She refused to award costs against them and some kind of damages to me for the University's blatant refusal to do it's f*cking job.</p>

                                <p>I guess this is so we understand the lengths that the Universities and Courts go to to ensure that Dr Leeks and the like will be the only game in town in New Zealand hospitals.  Before Harlene Hays set off on her mission to go ruin the University of Western Australia now, she refused to graduate more than 1/3rd the Medical Class.  Right?  Said that she did not accept the evidence that they supplied of being signed off as having completed their internships.  She simply refused dto accept tht.  The students were told that the Junior Doctor positons they were supposed to be taking up at the DHB's up and down NZ the following year were still there for them.  But they were going to be kept enrolled in the University and they were going to be kept paying fees to the University for continued re-enrolment and they were going to be passing themselves off as Junior Doctors in the hospitals but the University was going to refuse to acknowledge that they had completed the MBChB.  Welcome to the slave camp detention facility refusal to have an education and training programme land.  What's supposed to happen?  Well, there are various people (Justice Toogood, say) who has had lucrative governmetn payroll for 40++ years who think that the next generation or two should simply be marched off to death camps or serve as slaves or whatever so that he can never retire.  All of the money for them to refuse to train a new generation.  All of the money for htem to refuse to do any of the things that is in tehir actual job description.  What research outputs?  Where are all the theses?</p>

                                <p>The University of Waikato acknowledges that I compeleted a MA thesis with them.  Where is it?  It is not in the department repository.  My former supervisor sent it to me saying he thought I shuold have it.  Why?  I wrote it.  It was supposed to be lodged in the department thesis repository for the information of future students.  The University of Waikato is refusing to acknowledge research that is being done within teh University.  The people on payroll to research output..  What?  5,000 words of research every 2 years?  Every 5 years?  I understand, now, that academia itself takes research from some slaves and reattributes authorship of that research to other people.  You wouldn't expect the likes of Princeton to traffick in stealing research from Australaia, say, and passing it off as their own students work or ever the work of their Professors, right?  But that appears to be how low they go with the hiring decisions they choose to make.  Who wants to teach?  You can take your students work and pass it off as your own.  Then fail the students out so they won't find out what you have done.  Tell them they are too garbage.  Who wants to be an editor of a journal?  Take the submissions and reattribute them once the studnets have been bullied into fleeing the Univesrity with no credit.  It's just a scummy scummy scam is what it is.  It wouldnt' matter quite so much if you didin't need a degree to do something like law or medicine or engineering.  Oh, what's that?  They will never pay you to do any of those things if you have qualifications in the field.  Silly silly girl.  Didn't you know our hospitals, particularly, are 'staffed' by people who pay teh governmetn anything anything anything to play doctors and nurses for 10 days or whatever it is.  The likes of Dr Leeks.  The Glue Factory they have going on down in Dunedin.  The reason they won't process my application because I would stand up to the likes of Professor Glue.  Dr Leeks 2.0.</p>

                                <p>Dr Leeks!  All heil.  When will the monument in his honor be built? The monument so that he can reflect on how he had such an impactful life.  His victims will never forget.  Right?  That's the goal the purpose the aim the point.  Many of the kids he were sent had clear and obvious capacity and potential.  That's the truth of it.  And his job was to take them out.  Eliminte them.  So that certain other people's children were the only game in town.  The only candidate.  Because it's soooooo competitive.  The aim of Medicine being to kill and maim and harm and destroy.  Of course.  Clearly.  It's soooo cmoeptitive how could things be any other way?  The courts can get off their arses to order child uplifts before the evidnce is even in.  Before expert testimony for the other side can be heard (for a change).  In New Zealand 'Medical expert testimony' only ever means 'my way or the highway' by peple who were most emphaticlly NOT selected in virtue of their place on a rank order score list.  Corruption.  It's like they've had their eyes gouged out.</p>

                                <p>So, probably the scummy scam goes something like this...  1/3rd of the kids are offered Junior Doctor positions (for low to no pay since their NZ qualifications are not acknowledged in NZ -- which is what they started doing with the teachers near the start of Labors first current term).  The ones who are graduated likely were not offered positions.  So, they won't be doing Junior Doctor years in the hospitals, at all.  Not sure how many children of the administration are actually signed off as having completed and given paid junior doctor positions.  Maybe they need to have parents on the DHB of the hospital, specifically.  They ever find that guy who allegedly murdered his DHB board member wife to go live with his hooker?  Or did him and his wife both run off to live from the insurance money, or whatever they were up to.  What reason is there to believe that she died?</p>

                                <p>I wonder how much money you pay to play Orthopedics for 10 days before your wife gets to spend a lifetime in Hillmorton (apparently not in her interests to appear before the courts) and his children.  Well, what reason do we have to believe they are dead?  What happened to them before they died?  Were they really his chidren or was he traficking them in exhange for getting to play Doctors and Nurses in the hospitals for 10 days?  Why would we think the guy who killed the teenager who was going to tell everyone he was giving them drugs (from the hospital?) and sexually molesting them..  Why would we think he died in jail?  Why would we think that there wasn't a monmument erected in his honor someplace and he's gone off to help Harlene ruin Western Australia?  We are supposed to believe they don't have class roll lists in the cadavar laboratory?  How could anybody believe that he forged his way onto the class list?  How many kids per cadavar?  That was supposed to be one of the things limiting the number of new students enrolled in that programme.  His group would have had one extra student in it who was not on the class roll.  So, what happened?  Oh, when it was time to pay him for his work in the hospital they decided they would imprison him instead.  We will not pay doctors to work in the hospitals.  What education and training system?  F*cking psychopaths.  There's nothing there.  F*cking psychopaths.  Won't even process an application to enrol.  Won't even publically advertise jobs.  Ashley Bloomfield is Professor now?  He never even applied to study PhD.  He never wrote a PhD.  He never graduated with a PhD.  He is a 'doctor' in virtue of MBChB but they certainly will not pay him anything at all to work as a doctor in the f*cking hospital.  Or Ayesha.  Shane Reti is working only the most minimum hours required for registration only.  As a GP?  All his patients can only see him for 1 or is it 3 weeks of the year?  What a f*cking farce.</p>

                                <p>It does not matter what any of the laws are becuase the courts simply refuse to uphold them.  Won't do it.  So it doesn't matter what the laws are.  The Statutes are very very clear.  Relatively simple.  It's not f*cking rocket science.  It's not supposed to be.  And the Judges simply refuse to read and write and understand plain English.  Full of excuses and delays.  While they expediate judgment quickly quickly quickly on other cases before expert testimony comes in.  They refuse to uphold the law.  Nobody home.  NOthing here.  Just so the people understand the function of Meidcine and Law and things like that.  To oppress the people.  Engineering.  Buildings intentionally designed to be not fit for purpose by design.  Intentionally designing buildings so that it is not possible for things to be humane.  Intentionally going out of their way to ensure that they are not fit for purpose by design.  So that no actual doctors would ever apply to work in the hospitals etc, of course.  Since the whole goal or aim or purpose or point is to make money off the proceeds of crimes traffickign children for sex offenses adn the like.  Right Dr Leeks?  That's why we feed teenagers horse tranquiliser Dr Glue?  Sourced from teh hospital or vet science or somewhere else?  Who have the University of AUckland permission to manufacture LSD so they could feed that to people (and not keep accurte medical records) in the name of calling tehm psyhcotic and lockign them up and throwing away the key?  Is that the great plan?  I see now why they threw away my Masters thesis.  About how to help people with delusion.  The point of psychiatary isn't to help people it is to gaslight and undermine and oppress and so on.  That's the whole goal point aim or purpose.  Why?  Why, so the likes of Dr Leeks and Dr Glue and Justice Toogood can pat themselves on the back that they were the only qualified applicant for that job and allll of the money for them.  Alllll of of the money for them.  Alllll of the money for them.</p>

                                <p>Since the NZ governmetn will not prosecute corruption it makes NZ the natural magnet or choice for all the offenders out there.  Particularly child abusers.  Quite the destination. Who wants to work in pediatrics?  In teh schools?  We won't sign off on anybody unless they are a known offender with a plan as to how to make money pimping the children out, no doubt.  That way we don't need to opay them.  We don't needto pay Dr Leeks or Chris Whelan.  Right?  THe can make their money pimping the children out.  We don't need to pay Stuart McCutcheon -- right?  How much do you need to pay the Univesrity of AUckland to..  I don't know..  Rape a first year student with complete and utter immunity?  How many of those did he need to arrange per year to justify his salary do you think?  I suppose that makes sense of why they keep a tight reign on Psychiatry there (no prescription charts) so they can silence anybody who wants to speak out about the University of Auckland.  No complaints, right Chris Whelan?  Quarter of a Million for you!  What was the youngest studnet in AUT?  I mean, the Statute says 16 but don't let that stop you.  14 year old Vietnamese student in Finance?  Who came her with her 'guardian' (not mother) no less.  HOw many of those per year for your salary to pay for itself?  No complaints, right Chris?  It's okay.  The courts have determined that since you write the law (you do not) you are not subject to the law.  You can do anything you want with impunity says the judge hauled of retirement to output complete and utter garbage for half a million per year no doubt.  We don't see any corruption.  No corruption at all.  Don't get sick now, y' hear!!</p>

                                <p>And Australia seems to have shut it's f*cking yap about there being a vote to re-write the constitution to have Aboriginal Australaians formally acknowledged. See, the thinking would have been that the threshold on changing the constitution is high enough such that the general apathy from most Australians will mean that they will not vote to change the constitution.  Which will be a nice little racist message that the government can send about how it's the people's fault tha they are racist and there isnt' anything the governmetn can do.  Except 'the jig is up' rather, really, once you realise that NZ is written into the Australian Constitution as a state of New Zealdn and, of course, general apathy means that no vote occurrred to remove it from being a State.  And, really, why would the NZ people want not to be a state of Australia?  Since we constantly hear how wages are lower in NZ and we don't have access to basic medicines that are available in NZ and so on.  Apparently their education system is better than ours.  Because teh Australian National University can't process applications to enrol on the basis of academic merits.  That's how amazing Australian Institutions are.  With Harlene Hayes rolling out the 'we refuse to graduate you' plan to Western Australia, now, to ensure that there aren't any Medical Doctors.  I don't suppose there are any lawyers who can read.  I mean, NZ is obviously written into the Australian Constitution as a state.  But tehy refuse to supply voting papers.  I don't know what their basic reading programme is.. I suspect the problem is something different, entirely.  F*cking psychoapths.  That's for f*cking sure.</p>

                                <p>So.  Work hard in school kids!  Yeah, right!  Go along to school now and eat your lunch.  That's why we go to the Australian National University.  Right?  So we can have morning tea together.  To eat our lunch.  It surely isn't so that your academic work can be progressed in a timely fashion.  Or if they are too stupid or lazy or psychoapthic or busy or whatever to do the job for which they are paid (supervise their student) then at least get out of the f*cking way.  Write a little note to the external examienrs if they feel the need to 'sorry my studnets work is in this state but I was too stupid or lazy or psychopathic or busy or whatever it was to help them at all so it's up to you now externl examiner to give them the concrete changes they need to do to get it done in a timely fashion'.  F*cking psychopaths.  Sterelny chose to write 'The Evolved Apprentive' funded, I believe, by the French Government?  Instead of supervising various of his studnets.  So they could go on to erect vast momuments in his honor about how he was too f*cking psychopathic to do his f*cking job when it came to helping his students complete their aprpenticeships in a timely fashion.  What did Sterelny have to teach us?  I imagine it was a little something something about how you take work from x and then you credit it to y.  Maybe that's how the bulk of his work got done.  I suspect that is probably it.  Why he said he refused to acknowledge anytihng he wrote more than 5 years ago.  By that he means to say he treats the output of others as abandonware if they did not get formal recognition for having done it within 5 years it was given to someone else to take credit for it.  And, I would imagine people don't want to have to explain things that they did not even write that were credited to them as them having written when they stole it more than 5 years ago.</p>

                                <p>I think that is the best reason why they are refusing to acknowledge my work.  Because others have passed it off as their own since they did not acknowlwedge it as mine within 5 years.  That's why they are so determined to bully me away now.  That's the best expalnation or eason that I can see.  That's why you are supposed to not show work you have submitted to journals more widely.  THey hold up the peer review process until you have been bullied away then they can credit it to someone else.  David Lumsden was not very productive as a researcher.  I think that's why they hired him.  He was supposed to encourage studnets to work extra slowly and pay more and more and more and more and more moey to the University in fees, or something like that.  THey acknoweldged his work output as about 5,000 words every 2 or 5 years, I think.  So he could put a little footnote in his work about the students who had not been credited with the work tha tthe students had done.  The idea was that his studnets did not have their work on the topic published.  Instead, he got something published on the topic about 2 or 5 years after those studnets were bullied away.  See why they pay him? To take the work and hand it over to others so they can pass it off as their own.  That was the whole poitn of 'Turnitin'.  Handing over the research output of Australasia, particularly, sot hat studnets and professors of the Ivy League Institutions in the USA, primarily, could take credit for it.  And the rubbish in Australasia could rot.  Of course.  I guess that's what happens when you don't select students on the basis of ability.  Abilty to steal the outputs of others.  That ability.  I suppose.  That's how come it's easy to re-deploy them into other positons.  I guess.  They can go manage everything mewards in any field or whatever.  Just redeploy them to go ruin this field or that field or the other field.  Go mismanage the health system the education system the judiciary.  There really is nothing here.  The psychopaths took over.  Right Sterelny?  Wouldnt' have it any other way.  I mean, you woulldn't be in the position you are in if it were not so.  That's clear.</p>

                                <p>And now of course every man and his dog is filing Judicial Review of Adminsitrative Action and the Government expediated through all of their cases and still has not delivered justice on mine.  Was it Andrew Burrowford?  WHo was given a PhD (not a JD) for all of the work that he did initiating one against Bloomfield?  Of course the reason why they have him his PhD (after one decade?  Two?) was to STOP him from taking it through the court of appeal.  I would suppose.  I mean to say, there is not teeth in the high court.  The High Court Judges seem to have the job of writing judgments that articulate very clearly how they are NOT finding in the interests of justice, at all.  They really go out of their way to word-salad and gaslight really rubbing in the injustice.  Really rubbing it in.  Apparently it is just part of the process before the Court of Appeal rides in like a big knight actually delivering justice! ! Of course the idea, then, is to refuse to accept filings and refus to progress things through the court of appel.  Refuse to accept filings.  Didn't you know?  The Judges can order indefinate number of unlimited re-filings.  Of course they can.  I mean, if the Universities can do that to prevent and prohibit research tehn of course the Courts can order refiling nad refiling.  They can evern order the case to be changed from oen that is unlosable to one that is unwinnable. Didnt' you know?  They could even remove all reference to the law in teh filings an dthen say the filings aren't accepted because tehre isnt' reference to the law.  Didn't you know?  That's what justice meeeeeeeans.  Didn't you know?  That's what makes studying the law so desirable.  Or..  No.  That's what makes it soooooo cmopetitive.  Oooh.  Ooh me ooh my.  So, do the Judges get to visit the kids they've ordered to be uplifted, on the weekends, then?  Is that the problem or the issue, here?</p>

                                <p>And now I am thinking... The supervisor finds a thesis in their trophy room of theses they have hoarded from students who have been bullied away or murdered or what have you.  And the supervisor gives a thesis to a different student.  And the student accepts the PhD on the basis of the thesis that has been given to them by their supervisor or they don't get a PhD at all.  But if this is how you got your PhD you can see how you are now most valuable and most valued employee.  You can take your students work and pass it off as your own.  Or, you can hand it over so that other studnets can pass it off as their own.  The studnets from the 'best tier' institutions, obviously, need to be credited with the best work else their university starts to look like a scummy scummy scam.  Right?  So, there we go.  The scummy scummy scam.  I mean, what else are we to think when the Universities are not getting the studnets work out to external examiners so it can be examined on it's academic merits?  Waikato was very very clear with me that they KNEW that I had the capacity to do 1 year of research in 1 year.  That that was very specifically why they were going to refuse to formally acknowledge that I'd done that.  F*cking psychopaths.  What University?  But then I don't see that the Australiain National University (Australasias Premier Research Institution) is doing any better.  THey wouldnt' get my work out to externals either.  Sterelny wrote that he thought it should go out in 3 months to the administration.  But he did not tell me that.  And the administration did not get my work out 3 months later.  f*cking psychopaths.  Psychopathy!  Yay!  I know..  Let's give Jeannette Kinette (however you spell that) yet another research grant so that she can research psychopathy by paying her to subcontract her teaching work to a studnet and never ever ever ever sign that student off.  Psychopathy 101.  Indeed.  Alll of the research funds for you.  Alllll of the research funds for you Sterelny.  Only game in town!   Alll of the everything for you and your selfish selfish selfish selfish genes.  Apparently.  Making the world worse in the name of you helping yourself.  Indeed. </p>

                                <p>Hey, thanks for hte reference Martin Davies!!!  I worked on the topic of YOUR CHOOSING. You were paid hudnreds of thousands of dollars to research delusions.  And after I supplied you with a writing sample you offered me a summer scholarship to work with you on delusions.  SO I did did the readings you set me (all of them) and attended all the meetings you requested with me (weekly meetings, I attended all of them).  And I did my prep (did the readings and gave you writings by the deadline you set) all summer.  And I wrote a 50 minute seminar presentation talk as you requested.  And I delivered it as you requessted.  And you said (to me in private) that it was 'as good as anything that had been done, here'.  And you refused to write me a reference for PhD application.  Said that I should apply to the ANU and make everything as broad and wide as I could since you were leaving.  But you would not write me a reference.  Then I write a PhD for the ANU.  And I do everything that people on my panel and my supervisor asks me to do.  Everything that they ask me to do.  And they refuse to help me with the work.  They don't request meetings.  They don't comment on writings that I give them.  They don't get my work to externals.  They collect up all of the research money for themselves and they are horrible psychopathic bullies.  No I don't want to house-sit for you.  You are f*cking paid well enough to f*cking pay someone to do it.  F*ck you.  Worst hire ever.  Why the hell woudl someone go to teh ANU to work with Sterelny when they could have stayed in Wellington WEllington Wellington Wells.  Oh.  THey wanted to swap Sterelny with Richard Joyce since Joyce took a liking to sleeping with his graduate research studnets in the office and then refusing to get their work to externals.. He's the perfect fit for Wellington Wellington Wellington Wells.  No doubt.  Just so we can udnerstand why there is no research output in NZ Universities.</p>

                                <p>It's the desitnation to do all the research that ethics boards would not approve overseas.  particularly anything involving child abuse.  NZ is renowned for it.  Right?  It's all 'socially normal' in these parts.  We need to ensure that people are documetned as treating their kids very very badly indeed so then we don't need to feel bad about taking their kids and treating them comparably.  Of course, the parents often were askking for help..  But there is no help lin NZ.  It's all sooooo competitive.  The aim is to take out weaken sicken destroy maim.  It's all soooo cmopetitive.  Not because there are too many people...  The problem is something very very different entirely.  I would imagine that the most competitive situation of all woudl be when you are in the midst of a genocide.  Something like that.  That is, I suppose, why we don't acknowledge 'New Zealander' as a group.  Because I think the idea is to annihiliate the New Zealanders and declare New Zealnd terra nullus or whatever.  Prison detention camp of the Northern Hemisphere. Everyone here is a criminal psychopath violenlt offender.  So it's justified that they do their knock out baby studies etc etc in thse parts.  With complete impunity.  The courts don't function.  Of course.  And so on.</p>

                                <p>I mean, I guess the idea is..  If the governmetn is making a bunch of money off of 'edu-tourism' of the 'you pay us $100,000 and give us your 2 daughters and wife to do anytying anyting we want with and in return we will pretend you are orthopedic surgeon in the christchurch hospital for 10 days and you can do anything anything in the name of that' then you really need to ensure that there aren't any actual orthopedic surgeons to speak up about this guy being a fraud or a hoax or an impostor.  I mean to say the quality of the education and training progarmme needs to be kept such that the people in it and the graduates of it can't tell the difference.  Else, for things to be kept sooooo oppressive that nobody would speak up.  I guess because if yuo speak up then it's off to the prisons for you.  Where tehy will then say that it isn't in your interests to appear before the judge who was hauled out of retirement precisely for the occasion.  Maybe he likes to visit you on the weekends?  Is that the idea?  I eman..  I am really struggling to come to terms with just how corrupt things are or may  be in NZ..  When the Universities simply refuse to put things right internally and snigger when they tell you to try taking things through the courts if you have a problem, then.  I mean to say the universities have the utmost of confidence or faith in the inability or unwillingness of the courts to deliver justice in a timely fashion.  There is nothing in Australasia.  Or likely anyplace else.  Hard to tell.  the UK was pretty blatent about the Cambridge Curriculum being a hoax or a scam or a sham.  Never stop paying!  NEver stop paying!  NEver stop paying them to administer everything me-wards!  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                                <p>Of course they snigger becuase of the obviousness of Sterelny's proclamation that it must 'always be costly to punish'.  That way the psychopaths prevail.  So, of course, the courts never award the full amount of costs to the party who has been wronged by the psychopaths.  That way it is always costly to punish the psychoapths.  You see?  And of course it isn't just about the costs.  The schedule 2B costs, I mean to say.  The costs that are supposed to be awarded to punish unnecessary steps in the proceedings (like a QC choosing to file a motion to have proceedings stuck out when it was obvious to all parties that documentation of wrongdoing had been clearly supplied to the courts).  The courts won't award the full amount of legal costs.  Because they will not pay lawyers.  The courts won't award damages.  Because they aren't really 'courts'.  There aren't any 'judges'.  It's just a f*cking scam of a farce of a hoax.  There's nothing here.  Australasia chooses to govern, still, like a prison camp colony.  Australasia chooses to conduct itself like the Stanford Prison Experiimetn where people are arbitrarily divided into 'overlords' and 'oppressed' and where the only actual requisite for being overlord is getting off on oppressing others.  You don't want to have a slave colony of your own?  Then you get to be oppressed.  Congradulations.  You didn't want to play our stupid psychopath game. We don't choooooose you.  Right.  For all the qualities it is that they value.  Nasty .  Bruitish and shot.  RIP Stuart McCutcheon.  Of course I doubt he's actually dead.  Open casket funeral so people can (grief stricken of course) take some nail scrapings of DNA from the casket and his son?  Course not.  For obvious reaons.</p>

                                <p>The courts cry cry cry cry cry that they have too many filings to process.  But the only reason there is so many filings is because the judges request more and more and more filings.  It is a problem of their own making, I mean to say.  During the Covid Lockdown there were no new jury trials.  That means the courts have the opportunity to clear the backlog of cases that they have, particularly civil cases that do not require a jury.  So, what did the courts do during the lockdown?  They cry cry cry cry cry about how the lockdown means that they can't process or progress civil cases.  They can only demand re-filings and re-filings and re-filings and re-filings. Not a legal system, eh?  How can anybody do business in this jurisdiction?  Apparently nobody in business thinks that there is any purpose or function or whatever to the courts.  That is or means to say there are other mechanisms for..  Figuring out what is just or right or whatever in business interactions or transactions.  Yeah, right.  I call 'bullsh*t'.  There's actually nothing here.  I guess because they wouldn't process applications to law school, progressions.  Wouldn't develop a curriculum that was useful or good.  I don't know how you teach case law when the judges are some combination of on the take and / or incompetent most of the time.  When you don't graduate students from Law.  When you arrange for them to be sexually molested during their internships.  Practice for their clerkships, was that?  Or a heads-up on what they would be required to do for a position in a firm?  Is that the idea?  Maybe in order to get registration?  Corruption.  Things are too corrupt in these lands.  I don't see how it is possible for anybody to function.  Apparently if I shut up that will help.  Riiiiight.  If you take a look at my writing over on the writing page and so on you will see that I put up with really rather  lot (and did really rather a lot of traditionl work) before I was basically forced to turn to understanding that the psychopathic bullies weren't allowing me to function on...  Political grounds?   Because it's all sooooooo competitive that by the time they have taken everything they believe they are entitled to (and made the f*cking arbitrary decisions that make them feel powerful) there is nothing left for me.  How f*cking hard can it be to forward my work to external examiners?  The courtesy you showed to every other applicant?  Or..  I don't know...  Carl Brusse was required to work for 10+  years and write at least 2 PhD's on 2 different topics (so Princeton had the first one for their trophy room, I believe)...  But they did give him his PhD eventually.  I believe.  But I don't know how many times he house-sat for Kim Sterelny.  That must have been it...  Oh, he was fun at parties, I think Kim Sterelny enjoyed his company at morning and afternoon tea.  He was fun to travel with, I suppose? </p>
