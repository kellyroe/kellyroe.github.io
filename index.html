                            <article>

                            <p>
                            I started this website to self-publish some of the academic research work that I have done in academic philosophy over the years.  It turns out that university supervisors don't actually have the job of helping you complete your research to a high quality in a timely fashion.  Rather, their job is to do everything they can to undermine and stabotage and bully you into fleeing the university.  It is soooooo competitive, you see.  The aim, goal, purpose, point of the university is not to engage in or do or publish research.  Rather, it is the prevention and prohibition of research.  That appears to be the point.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I obtained a summer research scholarship from the ANU and worked on Professor Martin Davies Australian Research Council funded project on delusions.  He met with me every week and set me readings and read my writings.  I presented a 50 minute talk in a 2 hour seminar slot (the talk followed by 50 minutes of questions).  He subsequently refused to write me a reference for me to apply to PhD programmes in the USA.  I was offered a government scholarship to do a PhD at the Australian National University, however.  My understanding is that the Australian National University then ended its involvement in the Summer Research Scholarship programme.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I started a PhD with the Australian National University in Philosophy in 2006. I have documented work that I did while I was enrolled with them.  There were 4 distinctly different seminars in each year in my first two years.  I gave the talks at conferences and widely distributed either PDF's of my talk (available on the seminars page) or writen versions of my talk (also available on the seminars page) or both.  Nobody ever suggested to me that I send anything to a journal.  I publish my work here because I am not sure what happens to things when they succeed in getting a person to leave the university without having recieved formal credit or acknowledgment for the work that they have done.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            During my time as a PhD student I realised that I did not want a life as a philosophy academic.  I did not see much value of flying around the world attending conferences where people hide away in their rooms to finish writing their talks and don't attend half the talks (that people haven't really worked on, anyway) in order to go off sightseeing etc.  All this money for party party party party party.  I don't suppose it would be so bad if the research work was getting done but I have had to publish my own work, here, because the university did not see fit to supply me with supervision or progress or process my academic work in a timely fashion.  Party party party party party.  It's sooooooo competitive.  Party party party.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I returned to New Zealand thinking that I would be able to work towards entering Medical School.  Apparently it is sooooooo competitive, getting an academic job as a philosopher.  I mean, who wouldn't want to earn a lot of money for doing research then get sent all the research so one can cherry pick who to give the research to and who to credit for having done it?  Who wouldn't want to fly around the world party party partying?  It's sooooooo competitive.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I had heard, of course, that Medical School was sooooooo competitive.  But I thought the nature of the competition was in the GPA and the selection criterion that they published.  I knew my full-time GPA was very very high so I believed that it would be relatively straightforward for me to get a place in Medical School in New Zealand.  I was personally concerned, however, because I hadn't really studied science at secondary school.  So, on returning to New Zealand I set about learning science as best I could.  I applied to the 'foundations programme' at the University of Auckland but they prioritise selection for teenagers into the programme and it is not a programme for adult education.  I looked into correspondance school, in New Zealand, and I see that NZQA is sooooooo competitive.  The aim or purpose or point of it, I mean to say.  I learned enough science, and Medicine (from United States Medical Lisencing Examination study material) to know that I was capable of learning Medicine. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The University of Auckland told me that I needed to have completed a qualification from a NZ University within the last 5 years to be 'eligible' for MBChB with Auckland.  The Education and Training Act says that actually domestic adults are eligible for whatever programme they apply to.  While the University has discretion to choose to enrol teenagers (under the age of 20) into qualifications that they believe the studnet is capable of completing, only, they don't have discretion to order domestic adults to jump through any hoops at all in order for domestic adults to be eligible to apply to whatever programme the domestic adult chooses to apply to.  I kept my head down, however, and applied to do a 120 point MPhil research project with the Univeristy of Waikato for the purposes of eligibility with Auckland since that was what they asked me to do.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The University of Waikato acknowledged that they received my application by the deadline.  You can see this documented on the writing page.  They then considered my application for 120 point MPhil in a meeting where they were deciding who gets 360 point PhD scholarships.  My supervisor informed me that they wanted to know why I hadn't been ranked for a PhD scholarship and so she told them that I wanted to complete the 1 year research project in the 'minimum normal or standard time' so as to be 'eligible' to study MBChB with the University of Auckland.  They then had a chortle chortle snort about that and deemed it impossible.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I have documented on the writing page how they worked only to undermine and stabogate the timely completion of my 120 point 1 EFT research project.  This included them refusing to enrol me in the programme I applied to (with the course codes published in the University Calendar with the enrolment dates specified on my application) and how they enrolled me in various programmes of their choosing that I had never applied to be enrolled in.  I have documented emails from my supervisor to me instructing me on searching for readings, readings, acknowledging receipt of my writings.  This is to say I have documented that I was working under supervision.  When your supervisor instructs you to not get your work done in a timely fashion (e.g., to hand in your work late) then what are you supposed to do?  When I was an undergraduate the deadline was published and the box where you posted your work was unguarded so it was physically possible for studnets to post their work into the box by the published deadline.  The Universities are not progressing or processing research work, however.  They aren't getting the work to examiners in a timely fashion.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I submitted physical soft-bound copies of my 120 point Masters Research on 14 September 2018 (more than $80 to bind and ship them).  The University refused to send the work to external examiners.  They posted the theses back to me unexamined in February of 2019.  They say that I voluntarily chose to withdraw my thesis submissions but I did not and it makes no sense that I would have chosen to do that.  They have no record of my requesting them to not examine a thesis that I submitted to them for the purposes of external examination. I submitted physical soft-bound copies on 05 October  (more than $80 to bind and ship).  They sent the thesis out to external examiners with informational packets and instructions for the external examiners to examine the thesis with respect to acceptablity as a 'doctoral thesis'.  That is to say, they asked examiners to examine the 1 year under 50,000 word masters thesis project with respect to acceptability as a 3 year under 100,000 word doctoral thesis project.  The clearest reason as to why they did this was to attempt to force the external examiners into saying that in order for the masters length project to be acceptable as a doctoral length project it would need changes to the substance (it would need to be doubled in length) and the student would need to keep working on it (re-enrolment would be required).   
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The published university regulations stated that there were two outcomes that could be delivered  by the university when it came to changes to the substance.  Both examiners agreed in their reports that changes to the substance would be required 'before the thesis would be acceptable'.  One of the outcomes required the studnet to re-enrol for at least 6 months.  In this case, the thesis 'would be returned to the candidate', however.  Both external examiners kept the thesis that was posted to them, however.  Their information packets informed them that they would be provided by the university with any costs involved in their returning the thesis to the candidate.  So there was nothing to prevent or prohibit the external examiners from choosing to return the thesis to the candidate which would have indicated to the candidate that the external examiner was requiring them to reenroll for an additional 6 months.  The other outcome of examination involving alterations to the substance was that the student had up to 10 weeks to make changes to the substance to the satisfaction of either an external examiner or the candidates supervisor.  In other words, the only alterations to the substance that were required were ones that could feasibly be completed within 10 weeks.  Since both of the external examiners kept my thesis -- they refused to return it to the university even when the university wrote to them and asked them to return it to me since I was interpreting the academic calendar regulations 'literally'.  They refused to return the thesis to me.  I supplied to my supervisor a substantively updated thesis within 10 weeks on 05 January 2019.  I asked her to sign off on it so that campus copy could hardbind an exact physical copy of that version for hardcopy lodging in the library.  She refused.  She said it neede to go back to externals for re-examination.  I supplied to the dean of the school of research a substantively updated thesis within 10 weeks on 25 Febaruary 2019 so she could get it to my supervisor and the external examiners so that one of them could sign me off if they chose to do so.  She refused to get it to external examiners. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The University of Waikato is not allowing students to complete research projects in a timely fashion.  They seem to believe that their job is to ensure the prevention and prohibition of research.  They broke their own published calendar regulations on multiple occasions.  Refusing to enrol me, refusing to get my work to external examiners, refusing to allow the external examiners to sign off on completion of the qualification if and only if internationally accepted standards of scholarship had been attained.  I was instructed to follow the internal complaints resolution process of the university.  They then refused to work to put things right internally choosing to work only to delay and prohibit and prevent.  My supervisor was given internal promotion within the university.  She is something to do with scholarships, now.  I applied for various academic merit based university scholarships, you see, but did not get any scholarship funding.  Apparently this is because they are not academic grades based, rather they are given to students on the basis of a new assessment of their quality and they did not think that I was of the quality they wanted.  I don't actually see any evidence that any of the scholarship funding is being distributed to any studnets at all.  They used to publish lists of recipients of academic merit based financial awards -- so you could ask the student if they actually got the money they were supposed to have received -- but they don't seem to do this any more.  I asked them about it and they said that they don't publish scholarship information to protect the privacy of applicants when some scholarships are available to people on the basis of low financial status or standing.  But I wasn't asking them to supply information about those scholarships I was asking for evidence that there are any recipients for academic merit based scholarships when it is clear they are refusing to acknowledge their own GPA.  Where does the money go?  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I was then instructed to take them to court if I didn't like that.  So you can see (under Quigley's instruction) the various court cases.  It is like I write a thesis for the courts, now, documenting the crimes of New Zealand Universities.  They won't enrol studnets in qualifications they are eligible for.  The University of Auckland was supplied with information that I had completed the requirements of the MPhil (I made changes to the substance within the 10 weeks that was the only outcome of examination the University of Waikato could deliver given rule by law, their published calendar regulations, the examiners reports and fact they refused to return the thesis to the candidate).  I was not only eligible by statute (I am a domestic adult who has attained the age of 20 years) I also jumped through their arbitrary hoop that they set and completed the requirements of a new qualification (that was not MBChB) from a New Zealand University.  The University of Auckland refused to apply the algorithm they published (for the purposes of their accountability) to my transcript.  They refuse to accept that a 120 point qualification (a MA) completed over 2 academic years and 1 summer school period is completed on less than half-time (not full time) basis.  My best 120 points per year (over my last 3 full time years where there was at least 120 points per year) for my papers (including any summer school papers that are above stage 1 ) was 8.6.  The University of Auckland repeatedly refuses to input my correctly calculated GPA into their spreadsheet and offer me a place (or not) on the basis of whether my rank order score (determined by GPA, UMAT / UCAT, interview score) is or is not high enough for a place.  The only sense I can make of why they repeatedly refuse to input my GPA into their selection algorithm is because it was high enough for a place.  I  have documented the lengths that the University has gone to in order to refuse to engage in a fair process of candidate selection.  They are not making selection decisions on the basis of their published algorithm at all.  They do not believe they are accountable for how they are refusing to enrol, progress, graduate, and then go on to employ medical doctors.  They are working only to stabotage and undermine Medicine, in New Zealand.    </p>

                            <p>
                            They instruct or order me to take them to court if I don't like it.  So I write theses for the courts documenting the crimes.  I have emailed pretty much all of the legal aid lawyers for the Auckland region that are listed on the website.  None of them will take the cases.  New Zealand does not appear to have a functioning legal aid system.  I suppose it has to do with how studnets are (or are not) selected to study law, progressed through their training (or not) graduated (or not), on government payroll (or not).  I am forced to file my own proceedings if they are to be filed at all.  The courts then choose to refuse to progress the filings.  The Universities have a go at using in-house counsel -- and inhouse consel is shown to be grotesquely inadequate.  Rebecca Ewert misses a filing deadline and files a counter-claim (fails to do what is required, does what is not required).  I point out that the law says that she need not have filed anything at all and request things proceed in her absense (you don't need to do anything at all when someone files against you in the civil courts.  You can ignore the filing and things can proceed in your absense).  They then choose to employ a major firm.  This is a use for taxpayers dollars.  The prevention and prohibition of research and medicine in New Zealand.  The lengths they are prepared to go to to ensure that there be no universities, no doctors.  There don't seem to be any lawyers.  Two Justices were then re-appointed out of retirement for them to hear my filings.  I also have a case against the University of Otago for refusing to supply applications to enrol to candidates deemed eligible for enrolment by statute, refusing to properly process applications (throwing away or removing applications prior to meeting of the medical admissions committee, using 'disability' or 'experience of the heatlh system' information for the purposes of exclusion or discrimination only).  I also complained about Waikato to the New Zealand Vice Chancellor's Committee who has the Statutory function of progressing complaints about serious wrongdoing so as to uphold New Zealand's obligations to protect people who speak out about wrongdoing so that things can possibly be made better and New Zealand can possibly progress or develop.  Chris Whelan in his capacity as CE of the NZVCC has refused to progress or process any of the complaints that he has received.  He seems to think that his secret statutory function (for which he is paid) is to ensure that the statutory function is not performed by him and not by anybody else either (since he fills the job nobody else can do it).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Judges were pulled out of retirement and reappointed, appparently.  I don't know how that is legtimate anything at all.  Is that the process for appointing judges?  You get judges who have retired (because the worst that can happen to them is removal from office?  So there are no consequences whatsoever for corruption within the judges of the courts of New Zealand).  I have documented so that people can see how the judges refuse to accept evidence that I have supplied to them (e.g., refuse to accept that the University of Waikato acknowledged to me by email that they received my application to enrol in a particular programme by their specified applicaiton deadline) and refuse to acknowledge the half of the statutory laws that provide actual job descriptions or duties or obligations on the universities and NZVCC of New Zealand.  The statute does not give the universities unlimited power.  If a university is not allowing research to be performed (by studnets and faculty) then it is not a university.  The establishment conditions are not met.  If a universitity is not being accountable for enrolments, progressions, completions (to international standards -- not to domestic standards of keeping people hostages or slaves to labor indefinately for no credit or financial remuneration) then they are not a university.  Establishment conditions are not met.  New Zealand does not have universities (by choice) as the government keeps choosing to employ people who work only to ensure the statutory functions are not fulfilled.  Not by them (that is why they are appointed into position) and not by anyone (that is why they fill the position).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            New Zealand likes to say that it is one of the least corrupt countries in the world but the truth is that New Zealand has one of the lowest rates of successful prosecution of corruption related offences in the world because New Zealand will not prosecute corruption related offences.  Once it became apparent that the Universities were using internal resolution to close ranks and delay only (and once internal resolution was exhausted) I acted under Quigley's instructions to take them to court.  Now we have documented how the courts fail to deliver justice in a timely fashion, as well.  The legal aid system does not work (there are not lawyers available) and government departments will choose to use the legal system in New Zealand to continue on with their crimes only.  There is not a functioning judiciary any more than a functioning education system any more than a functioning health system.  There is nothing here.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            It doesn't seem that Australia is doing any better with any of this.  They choose to hire Harlene Hayes who prohibited and prevented the development of Education in Otago and worked only to undermine the university there.  She is now ensuring the prevention and prohibition of development over in Western Australia.  Kim Sterelny got pulled from Wellington (victoria) to ensure the prevention and prohibition of research at the Australian National University.  He writes 'the Evolved apprentice' about a system of slavery, effectively.  All the things that go into the prevention and prohibition of skilled workers.  Refusing to train the next generation.  Refusing to teach them anything and also refusal to get out of their way.  If you are too busy or too lazy to do your job supervising when your only job is to do your own research and to supervise your students then the very very least you can do is get your students work out to external examiners in a timely fashion.  My work is available on this website.  It was widely distributed at conferences and the like.  I don't know if the problem now is that other people have received acknowledgement or credit as being the author of it, or quite what has happened.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I did not know how corrupt things were.  I did not know that other people were playing this game of stabotage and undermining. I did not know that people were trying to bully me away so that they could have a job where they were paid to party party party party party and where they would get studnets doing their work for them and they would then bully the studnets into going away so they could pass the studnets work off as their own.  I suppose that's the idea.  The prevention and prohibition of development programme.  Party party party.

                                <p>The Tertiary Education Commission defines a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:

The writing tab shows that the University acknowledged having received my application to enrol in a 120 point MPhil with 05 March 2018 start date by their prescribed deadline.  The TEC approved the qualification as being 'right sized'.  They have the statutory function of approving qualifications and checking that the enrolment period (34 weeks) matches the FTE EFTS (1) also the points value (120).  But the University of Waikato is keeping records showing that they are not billing students in this manner, at all.  They have had every opportunity to correct their records and they refuse.  They instructed me to take them to court if I had a problem with their practices.  The courts have, thus far, refused to uphold justice.  International and domestic community need to be warned that they are lacking in honesty and integrity.  They are interested in closing ranks around their wrongs.  New Zealand isn't lacking skilled workforce or labor, at all.  New Zealand is a nasty little despot where the people with power refuse to allow other people to function.  Hostages.
                            </p>

                            <p>The University of Waikato believes they are entitled to require studnets to work for at least 12 months on their 120 point 1 EFT thesis before undergoing an external examination period of up to 3 months.  Since you are required to be enrolled at the end of the external examination period that means that if the examination period takes 3 months then you are required to be enrolled in and pay fees for an enrolment period of 12 months plus 3 months for a total of 15 months.  They took more than 3 months to examine my MA.  I think they only did examine it because I had already left the country.  But it doesn't stop there.  They believe that if the external examiners say anything about changes needing to be made to the substance (e.g., a reference to be added, a section to be moved around) then they are entitled to require the studnet to re-enrol for an additional 6 months and also undergo another external examination period of up to 3 months.  That means another 9 months added.  Basically forcing the student to repeat the f*cking year.  They say that the outcome of what they like to call 'first examination' is always that the student is required to pay fees for another 9 months.  This is fairly inevitable.  That is to say, they offer the 120 point qualification with the expectation that students will end up working for at least 12 months plus 3 months plus 6 months plus 3 months for a total of 24 months (2 years).  What happens then depends a  bit on the university.  Waikato has this 'option' for the university administration whereby the studnet takes another 2 1/2 months to make minor changes.  Find another reference.  Move a comma.  Etc.  The University administration believe they have discretion to force this -- else they can say the student failed to meet their requirements and the qualification is withheld.

                            <p>Here is how much the Inland Revenue now says I owe the New Zealand Government for my 'Education' and 'Training' that are not acknowledged because New Zealand qualifications apparently expire 5 years post-graduation (well, not the Judges law degrees, apparently, but my qualifications have expired): 
                            <a href="judicial-review/ird-shot.pdf" target="_self"> $104,663.</a>  You can see, then, that New Zealand does not appear to have functioning Universities, they appear to have detention or forced labor camps.  They won't progress or process academic work (particularly research).  They refuse to get official documents (theses submitted for examination) to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit external examiners signing off on qualification completions.  There is no skilled labor workforce, in New Zealand, because New Zealand has a series or system of forced labor detention camps only.  You pay the University you pay the University you pay the University you pay the University.  Maybe they put you to work as an actor playing the part of a skilled professional.  Then, when you are done paying them, your qualifications are withheld.

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  Demanding me to pay more and more and more money to the courts else they force all my cases aborted, or abandoned.  <a href="judicial-review/sc-eyes.pdf" target="_self"> Here is the Judgement of the Supreme Court that I am attempting to appeal on the grounds that it is manifestly grotesquely unjust. </a>  It is like they have their eyes poked out.  Our highest court does not seem to have the conception of justice, at all.  It was the courts decision to delay Roe v University of Waikato proceedings until AFTER Roe v NZVCC and also until AFTER Roe v University of Auckland.  The Judge for Roe v NZVCC made all kinds of pronouncement in his judgment on the matter of Roe v University of Waikato.  That is to say instead of judging the issue he was supposed to be judging (the inaction of Chris Whelan in his capacity as CE of the NZVCC) he thought he would weigh in on whether or not I had done enough for completion of the MPhil Degree.  Clearly that is a matter of the Judge of a different case to decide!

                             <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  The Australian Constitution clearly names New Zealand as a state of Australia.  They say that they don't have to honor the constitution because New Zealand officials did not turn up to various things and they did not consent.  I don't know why Australia would care about consent in that instance.  Did they care about the consent of the Aboriginal people of Australia?  Did they care about consent of people to be immunised or subject to medical treatments or experimentation?  If they want to change the constitution then there is a process for it to be changed.  I think it involves a vote.  But New Zealanders don't get to vote so the Australian Government clearly does not care whether or not the people of New Zealand consent.  New Zealand functions as a detention camp of Australia.  But then, Australia still seems to govern like it is a detention camp of the Northern Hemisphere, so...

                            <p>Una Jagose doesn't seem to have the job of instructing Crown Law to prosecute corruption within New Zealand Universities, or within the Judiciary (where judges refuse to accept evidence and where the supreme court punishes people for bringing injustices before the courts).  I suppose that is why they pay her more than half a million dollars to do that job.  They pay her to ensure the job is not done by anyone.  Not by her and not by anybody else.  The fact she is in the job prevents and prohibits the job being filled  by anyone with the willingness and ability to do the job.  It seems there is no evidence that they will accept that would attest to corruption.  None of the invoicing information that I provided (e.g., 0.5 EFTS = 120 points = 60 points = indefinate enrolment).  New Zealand does not appear to have a functioning judiciary.    <p> <a href="judicial-review/crown-law.pdf" target="_self"> Blow off response. </a>

It all starts to sound confusing, doesn't it.  The gaslighting garbage output nonsense nonsene nonsense from the courts.  Denying the evidence.  Refusing to acknowledge the half of the laws that speak to the duties and responsiblities and actual job descriptions of the various government departments (e.g, the NZVCC and various of the Universities).

                            The New Zealand Government seems to think that the only kinds of Degrees there are are honorary Degrees such as those conferred by Harvard on whomever they want for whatever arbitrary reasons they want.  You don't get a PhD in Law from Harvard by attending classes, doing requisite readings etc.  You get a PhD in Law from Harvard for...  Uh...  Decriminalising abortion.  Apparently.  When abortion was a criminal offence in New Zealand we had one of the highest rates of documented abortion in the developed world.  We were simultaneously one of the places with the lowest rates of corruption.  Go figure.

                            <p>
                            In New Zealand cooperative or coordinated effort only seems to be suicidal or genocidal in orientation or aim.  The government works really hard to close ranks about itself.  But nobody would voluntarily choose to enrol in a University who refuses to progress and graduate studnets when (and only when) they have met requirements of qualification completion to international standards, and so on.  How is our immunisation compliance doing now?  I guess you will need to graduate and employ a new generation of nurses to administer expired anasthetic solution resulting in wrongful death and so on.  How are the euthanasia drug roll outs coming along?  The whole thing is a f*cking farce. But what is worse (the very very worst thing) is the lack of 'try'.  The lack of a genuine working towards making things better.  Committed to the low road.  Just how low can we go, just  how bad can things be.

                            Apparently it isn't just me.  Apparently this is how they treat most of the people.  What seems to be in common of the people who are treated differently is about who their parents are.  The University of Auckland (at least) seems to be making decisions about who to enrol in what Degree (and whether the Degree will ever be awarded) on the basis of information like parental address and secondary school attended.  They say that they collect information about equity group members for the purposes of being fairer in selection (to make sure that underrepresented groups are represented) but they then use that information to throw away applications from certain candidates (the ones who would be likely to go on to do good work for that equity group).  New Zealand is renowned the world over for 'tall poppy syndrome' and about how the point or purpose of identifying people with capacity for various things is only really to ensure that they be prevented and prohibited from doing any of them.  It's like the final electron acceptor sucking everything into the sink-hole.  The low road.  The prevention and prohibition of development programme.  Party party party.  Lets have a party.

                            All this stuff in the news, now, about various Medical Doctors being kept in prisons and psychiatric facilities in New Zealand.  Given what has been documented about the state of New Zealand (literally) here, it seems more likely to me that these are legitimate people who the New Zealand Government has chosen to lock up as hostages.  I mean, it defys credibility to think that someone who isn't enrolled cons their way into cadaver lab dissections etc.  I mean, consider how the University of Auckland requires identification to go to lectures (to ensure people like me don't get to ask questions) and laboratories and so on.  It isn't plausible to think that someone pretended to be a medical student and nobody realised this.  What is most plausible is that they (for whatever reason) decided to take back his ID number and so on and pretend they had never heard of him.  Maybe because he decided to order a scan (or try and order a dx scan) for someone who was from the wrong post-code and race to get one.  Because the government doesn't want various people to live.  It doesn't make any sense that they would want to give those people healthcare.  Or an education.  Why would the government want people to be able to document their crimes.  To document how the Universities of New Zealand are engaging in fraudulnet billings.  To document how 120 EFTS = indefinate detention (according to the judicary of New Zealand).  Dr Leeks gets promoted to Melborne to better enable him to carry out his good works over there.  Some guy gets to..  What happened??  He gets to pretend to be Orthopedic Surgeon in the hospitals of New Zealand in exhange for leaving his (medical doctor?) wife in Hillmorton.  New Zealand doesn't see any corruption.  Not in medical procurement.  The funds go towards keeping a prostitute in Sydney?  That's how it does not work?  Party party party in Sydney?

                            How many students got to do work placement with Dr Leeks?  How many references did he write?  How do you think he decided who would (and who would not) be signed off has having completed the requirements of their internship?  Who do you think he wanted (and why did he want them) to be chosen to undertake psychiatry training?  To obtain registration?

                            Or how about these retired judges?  The ones who won't acknowledge evidence put before them or the half of the education act that confers duties and responsibilities upon the Universities?  Of course I'm assuming that they aren't imprisoned themselves simply being required to sign off on judgments written by..  Um...

                            New Zealand does not function as a developed nation at all.  I don't think Australia does, either.  Not so far as I can see.  I can't see any indication of that, at all.

                            The main aim or goal or point or purpose of politics, in New Zealand, seems to be to promulgate this idea/l that 'there is no alternative' for the reason that everyone in it is as bad or just as bad as everyone else.  National comes out with a story about how they intentionally knowingly choose to progress and process the advancement of canddiates with a known history of violent bullying.  Then Labor goes 'meeeeeee toooooo' and comes out with it's own story about how National doesn't get to win the how low can we go game, Labor can go lower and lower than lower than low to.  Labor can bully one of it's own people just as much as they like.  If you complain about bullying -- then instead of their being an investigation into the situation the appropriate response is to bully the person who speaks up.  The complete and utter opposite of whistleblower protection.  More than that, all of the time and attention and effort must be devoted to bullying and persecuting.  It cannot be working together for a satisfactory resolution that is integrity preserving for all parties.  No.  Not on their watch.  Think low.  Think low.  Think lower than low.  How low can we go?  Well, we must be forced to follow (development wise) Australia 50 years ago.  Is that the idea?  And, of course, Australia, in turn, must be forced to follow the USA how it was 50 years ago.  And so on.  It was easier to get internet to the people of Otago than the people of Downtown Providence, RI.  Go figure.  There are no (federally funded) psychiatric 'hospital' detention camps in the USA.  Yeah, right.

                            <p>
                            So once Andrea Howard was done refusing to supply and progress applications to Medical School she was redeployed to (one can only suppose) ensure that applications to do with solutions to the rabbit problem in Otago were similarly mis-handled.  That way we have the same old same old situation where there isn't a coordinated humane response.  Rather, a few individuals get to live-out their pathology making milkshakes of infected rabbit organ meats to blend with carrots and feed to the rabbits in the winter-time.  Now lets talk about the prison and closed ward hospital procurement programme for the food contracts.  Aged care facilities.  Nobody else need apply.  Don't worry.  The selection progress is doing just what it was meant to do.  Right?  The prevention and prohibition of development programme.  Concentrate disease as much as you can and induce as much sickness as possible.  That's the aim or the point or the goal.  Right?  I can't really think of a better explanation for all the work that goes into ensuring that that  be and that that remain the case.  Adam Smith wrote about how there didn't need to be an invisible hand behind progress or progression or development or whatever.  Not quite, but evolution supposedly shows us that the default development trajectory is increased complexity and greater division of labor and so on.  Higher levels of coordination.  So when things aren't developing then perhaps the appropriate question is who or what is responsible for preventing and prohibiting things from developing then?  Who are these individuals who are refusing to perform their job descriptions.  There doesn't seem to be much wrong with many of the statutory laws.  The problem is that the laws aren't enforced or upheld in these parts.  Individuals are selected into their positions for the role they are willing to play in ensuring that whatever their job description is is something that is not performed or done.   Not by them.  And to seek out and destroy anyone with the actual willingness and ability to do the job.  
                            </p>

                            <p>Socrates said 'the unexamined life is not worth living' and Universities refuse to send their students work out in order to prevent and prohibit them being examined for the programme they applied to be enrolled in.  They prevent and prohibit an examination of the quality of the work that the student did on that qualification that they applied to be enrolled in.  That tells you what the university assesses the life of the student is worth.  But who appointed them judge?  The work was supposed to be externally examined by people who were independent in the sense of being blind to or not knowing things about the student.  Particularly, whether the student liked to party party party party party and supply teenagers to the administration so they could party party party with all the teenage boys and girls...  Because that seems to be what they value.  Right?  Isn't that the function of the university?  It's soooooo fun to live in a slum and party party party party party.  That's the university experience.  Right?  Wait...  It isn't?  That's just how Harlene Hayes etc choose to spend their time and taxpayers money.  1/3 of the Medical Student cohort were sent (by the University of Otago) to do internships overseas where the expectation was that the students would pay money in exhange for sign-off and not attend the hospital.  The fact that the students did what was expected of them (paid for sign-off and did not attend the hospital) was then used as a reason to withhold graduation from them and demand they continue to pay the university / New Zealand Government.  They were then put to work in the New Zealand hospitals as Junior Doctors while their Medical Graduation Degrees were withheld.  We don't know how many of the students who did their internships in New Zealand similarly had their Graduation Degrees withheld.  We don't know how many FTE positions for qualified Medical Doctors in New Zealand are actually filled by people who graduated Medical School.  New Zealand Medical Schools don't seem to be graduating people.  They will pull people out of retirement and put them back on payroll so they can support their party party party dreams and desires and an entire generation (or more) of people seem expected to continually pay to support their party party party party party lifestyles.  </p>

                            And then people get sick.  And then they die.  And you are supposed to go 'phew' because it's soooooooooooo competitive.  Parents need to be told that if their kid learns reading writing and arithmetic it is despite or in spite of the government of New Zealand.  The government of New Zealand does not want to govern a literate and educated population.  They want to be head of the rubbish.  Manage as many people in institutions on less than $1 a day (hey, I know, let's feed them the diseased rabbits.  Maybe the poisoned possums.  How low can we go?  How much lower than low?)  I am genuinely curious about that because I know at some point there was a furore about the food in the Grafton hospital...  When I was in the closed ward there there was definately and most certainly something very very very very wrong with the hospital food.  The Ombudsman ommitted mention of the hospital food in the secure ward.  It is a different food contract to the food supplied in the general ward (I think only because of the outcry however many years ago).  He said (more recently) that the special diet food in the general was very good.  But he did not comment on the general food in general and he certainly made no mention of the food in the secure ward.  The grey porridge kind of a puree...  If you make your bed maybe they will let you use the vending machine...  No?  Give you a cigarette?

                            <p>Does Des Gorman like to party? I suppose he probably does...  He would know about setting the students up to fail.  He has been paid by the Government to work his job teaching the Medical Students to say 'no amount of association can proooooooooove causation' when they are called on to give evidence of reason for ACC to deny medical treatment and funding to people who (for example) were exposed to aesbestos in building material who also happened to have mesothelioma.  I mean, if he wasn't on payroll saying 'you can't proooooooove our product causes harm' on behalf of tobacco or vaping or benzodiazapine sales...  Horse tranquiliser...  Old generation anti-psychotics...  Eating diseased rabbit organs...  Then he'd be working for the New Zealand government picking and choosing the people who get signed off as having completed requirements for Medical Degrees.  Right?  Does it even see patients?  I don't think they will give you a clinical Degree unless you promise not to help patients.  Party party party.  Right?
