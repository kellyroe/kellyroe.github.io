                                <a href="https://kellyroe.github.io/writing/realmecv.pdf">Chronological CV</a>
                                There is a link to my CV that I have presently under consideration for various things.
                             </p>

                             <p>I will try not to do  anything to break the links.</p>

                             <p>I am file re-formatting my work and organising it into yearly increments.  E.g., </p>

                              <a href="./writing/ks.png">Here is an example of an email from Kim Sterelny (who will not write me a reference).</a> 

                              I collated the 'few small chunks' as he refers to them, here:
                              </p> 

                                <p><a href="./publish/2013-rep.pdf">Roe, (2013).  A few small chunks for 2013.</a>

                                <p>So, one of the perks of being a full time employee of a University is that you can take courses for free.  Without paying.  Who does that?  Seriously...  Who does that?  Do you see Professors enrolled in first year or second year or third year courses?  Of course you don't.  Do you see them doing much in the way of any research, either?  Why would they.  They take all of the money.  THey won't retire once they get to 65.  Why would they retire?  They can tell the kiddies that it's soooo competitive they are required to do anything and everything they say.  Else they won't get their work out for external examination.  They won't write them references.  They can behave as badly as they want and nobody will do anything about it at all.  Who wouldn't want to be Professor.  Right Jacinda?  It's not like you have to spend your time actually squirreled away from the world actually writing a book.  Actually reading and writing.  They'll find you something and cross out the authors name and put yours on it.  Right?  And you can spend all your time flying about the place putting on your party frock being a wing-man for the new Epstein or whatever.  Who wouldn't want to pay and pay and pay to send their kiddies to Harvard so they can party party party with the likes of Jacinda all day?  What University?  How does Jacinda get a Visa to be Professor in the US?  It just doesn't make any sense at all.</p>
