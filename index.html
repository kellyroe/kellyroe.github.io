 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>They do everything they can to muddy the waters when it comes to testing.  Ideally..  You have a test where people know it when they see it.  Else, once the answer is explained they agree that it was a good question.  But that's why we teach critical thinking.  So that there will be no consensus even on the simplest of reading comprehension tasks.</p>

                                <p>'The richest 1 per cent aren't the smartest 1 per cent'.  Uh.  Well, duh.  How about this one:  'The richest 1 per cent are the smartest at money management'.  Does that work for you?  You think that might be true?  What do you think it *means* to be in the richest 1 per cent?  What is the point of commanding that much wealth?  What the hell would you do with it if you commanded that much wealth?  How many people would actually want to be responsible for commanding that much wealth?  What the hell would they do with it?  ffs.  What does the average person think is involved in doing a PhD?  I am curious about that.  Or, let me put it differently, what does the average person think is involved in being credited as having done a PhD?  I mean...  What do you think it means, to the average person, that Jacinda Ardern was granted one on an honorary basis, for example?  What does it mean?  Most people don't know enough to ask to see the identification badge and to phone up to check the registration number on the person presenting to them as 'Medical Doctor'.  They don't know enough to check who, exactly, is going to be doing teh operation and who, exactly, is going to be scrubbing into the OR.  Why would they even bother to scrub their hands, at that point?    </p>

                                <p>I don't think that Chris Whelan or Justice Toogood's problem is stupidity.  I don't think the problem is lack of intelligence.  I don't think that is it.   I mean...  There has been a lot of characterising of psychopaths as being mentally defective in traditional senses of intelligence.  Being short term focused (being opportunistic for as long as you are getting away with it hoping that people will in fact kill you before you are forced to live the way you have chosen to keep others).  Like the idea that men engage in the riskiest short term behavior when they are young.  18 or so.  Their brains are still developing and growing.  Under the influence of testosterone.  Feeling invulnerable.  Not identifying with vulnerability at all.  No consideration for those who are vulnerable.  That kind or a sort of a thing.  Mad with power.  Might is right (because they are the strongest they like that game).  Etc.  Lack of empathy.  Then they are supposed to fall in love, or something and want to protect something not-them for a change.  So the job of everyone else is to placate the bullies and try and charm them over.  THen they think that the job or function of everybody else is to be charming trophy wives or children or whatever.  Supplication.  Begging for mercy.  And the like.</p>

                                <p>What does it mean, to be the smartest?  I guess people are thinking of those who score well on tests.  Okay, but do the smart people write the tests, then, do they?  Do the smartest doctors write the tests to identify the smartest students, do they?  Often the people who position themselves as making up the tests are not the same as those who scored well on testing.  I mean to say...  I'm not sure what kind or sort of mathematical ability lies behind the masterminds of the NCEA assessments...  For example...  I don't think the people who tested great are making up the tests..  The tests aren't really designed to identify students with capacity.  THey are designed to muddy the waters.  Obscure that they are expediating their own kids at the expense of everyone else, for the most part.  If that means they go to pains to only give some studnets pre-exposure to the questions and or answers, if that means they actively change their answers etc...  They won't get studnets research out to external examiners so it can be actually peer assessed on the basis of academic merits.  They pick and choose who to give PhD's to on non-academic grounds.  It isn't an academic qualification at all, so far as I can see...  They wouldn't get my thesis out for external examination...  Not because they thought it would fail (they failed my by refusing to send it out) but they wanted to expedediate giving a bunch of other people their PhD instead of me.  I don't know that they sent those other people's PhD out for examination either...  But they did put on their silly suits and toast to their being credited as having done enough for a PhD.  So they got in applications, subsequently, for employment and research funding.  Which they received, them being the only game in town (the only eligible applicants) and all that.</p>

                                <p>I don't think that anybody thinks that our politicians are particularly clever, smart, or bright.  I mean to say, I think that the average person actually thinks they are stupid, in fact.  But they just try and keep their heads down and manouver away from the bullies.  The politicians are more commonly or often regarded,  by people, to be bullies.  Right?  Trying to muster a mob to do their bidding.  Charm people into doing what they say.  Voting them most popular.  THey don't seem to have a care for developing sensible or coherent or kind or good policies, even.  They seem to think the population they are supposed to serve is stupid.  They talk to the people like the people are stupid.  They are patronising and condescending.  They clearly think that they are very very very very clever,  but I don't think that that is how the people think of the politicins.  And after things like...  The decision that the speaker of the house made to play 'baby shark' (yes, that's how clever they think they are in Wellington) and be redeployed ot be diplomat of Irelalnd...  Likely so he can figure how to help the leaders of NZ keep the people in NZ more like times of the Irish Famine since nobody was held to account for atrocities or crimes that's a good plan for NZ, right?  That should get the people more properly toeing the line??</p>

                                <p>If people had to say who they thought some of the smartest people were in the world or history of the world...  I don't think that many of them would point to people who were involved in academics or universities.  Not people who were considered to be particularly bright by the leaders or leading academics of their day.  The ones who collected all the titles and money for htemselves I mean to say.  The ones that grubby grubbed up all of the attention.  All eyes on them and everything they have to say.  NOt for a very very very very very very very very very very very long time, anyway.  I mean, maybe people would say Plato.  Which is 'funny' since he was passing off his teachers work as his own after they killed his teacher.  Right?  Plato's Socrates.  MOtivating and inspiring, that.  What happened to Socrates?  He volunteered to die.  Sure he did.  That's what Plato says about that anyway.  Somethign about the Laws protecting Socrates when he was young.  Think about how the laws of your land protect you, then.  What laws?  What judges?  What civlisation?</p>

                                <p>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/one-day-youll-thank-me-how-to-find-the-best-school-for-your-child/LEV5C4OV6ZHJ3O5LMIW5JC3HOU/  Aw.  Come on.  I know what you should do.  Pay us money pay us money pay us money pay us money.  No private primary or secondary school fees actually compares to what the tertiary system in NZ charges for detention in the public universities (and there are no priavate).  It's all just a scummy hoax of a scummy scam of a there is actually nothing there variety.  I don't know why anybody would voluntarily choose to pay into a corrupt system that has no intention of even honoring it's contracts or anything at all.  I mean to say that there is no such thing as buying justice or healthcare or education.  THere are various things that money can't buy.  Those, notoriously.  It doesn't matter how many millions or trillians you try and pay into NZ it does not and will not alter the fact that thereis nothing here.</p>

                                <p>I mean, I guess that what I am saying is that there isn't a way.  They will say that you didn't fork out for private schools (reason why) but the fact is that if you did that would not have altered your chances at all.  Fact is:  There simply isn't anything there.  No such thing.  Huh.  Nothing worth working towards, at all.</p>

                                <p>Here is the thing..  You kind of want to say that NZ is IHC land.  Like people have appointed the IHC into all the positions of power and the problem is that the entire nation is being held hostage by the IHC.  Only, it would be massively inpolite and also not culturally appropriate to call it for that. Only...  I have had the good fortune to have met, throughout my life, a lot of people.  Many of whom have been deemed by the government to be intellectually handicapped or retarded or incpacitated in various ways..  And the thing is that none of them or those people would be or actually are responsible for the.. Uh....  I guess they aren't accurately or appropriately labelled as 'retarded' policies that the leaders of NZ just keep on insisting and thrusting before us as the only game in town...  Yeah...</p>

                                <p>This is a 'by the way' comment.  Where is Brian Tamaki?  I am asking because Jacinda was ridiculing that he would get any votes and then shortly after that he was being held in Mt Eden (because they couldn't find criminals more worthy, one can only suppose).  I haven't hear anything from him lately.. Is he even on the election campaign?  That is concerning after him being ridiculed by the Labor Party Representative.  Right?  Where is he?  What are his policies?  We don't even have the option to vote for him?  Not saying I would... But I don't seem to be able to even hear his poicies...  Only game in town.  No game in town.  Unlawful detention camp prison land there is no alternative.</p>

                                <p>https://nzhistory.govt.nz/war/military-defaulters-list  F*cking hell.  How big is the list supposed to be before the NZ government go 'you know what?  The people we are serving don't seem to want this'?  There is intellectually handicapped (according to them and the only people they will employ to pronounce such things) and then there is something different, entirely...</p>

                                <p>https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2023/03/pregnant-iranian-kiwi-feels-discriminated-against-by-immigration-nz-after-parents-unable-to-get-visa-to-be-with-her.html  Okay.  So here is what we do now.  We deny that to everybody.  So your claim to 'discrimination' never will be upheld.  Every time someone files that something is wrong because of 'discrimination' then we set out to ensure that that very thing apply to more and more and more and more and more...  So the claim of 'discrimination' can never be upheld.  See.  First they came for x.  But then when then members of x community said they were unfairly targeting x they replied 'well, now, we didn't want to do that so then we set about targeting y as well'.  And if you complain, then, about them unfairly targeting x and y they will find themselves a z..  Thereby aspiring to new lows.  How low can we go?  Why..  Let's see?!</p>

                                <p>First they came for x and I did not complain because I was not x.  Then they came for y and I did not complain because I was not y..  And so on.  Until they came for me.  And nodody would stand for me because ther ewasn't any people left.</p>

                                <p>Aw, well here you go now.  Don't worry Chris Whelan, I'm sure WINZ can find a job for YOU.  Here is some motivation and inspiration for you  https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/entertainment/sex-worker-granny-charla-hathaway-brings-her-show-naked-at-my-age-to-nz/  They will even help you make up a CV etc.  I'm sure.  Not sure they will help you with drycleaning on your laundry...  Wink wink...  Oh wells...</p>

                                <p>Hugs in the work place?  IMHO:  Not cool.  Kisses?  Like french kiss kiss on the side of each cheek? Also:  Not cool.  Uh..  Whose job is it to set the tone on what is cool or not cool?  What is expected (you will be fired or not advances in your career unless you voluntarily do that which nobody will come out and say is not expected...)  Blow jobs?  Maybe offer of a blow job?  Is that what is required?  For you not to be laid off?  Or simply not advanced?  Not to be signed off on your training programme?  Who is responsible?  Who has the power and authority to set the tone?  IMHO..  Kisses and hugs and blowjobs:  Not appropriate.  Handshakes were frought...  But they were the norm.  I think we were supposed to be retreating from handshakes (in the name of basic hygeine) to bumping elbows.  Or bows / nods.  But some people really really really like their blowjobs (and then you fire them and replace them with younger models).  Of course you do.  Why wouldn't you when you are getting away with it.  Chortle snort.  Re-Appoint judges from retirement to continue to uphold everything it is that they I mean you I mean they I mean you I mean everybody values.  Of course.</p>

                                <p>Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't get my answer right.  Empoyment lawyer (only one who would be recognised as such) says that Maaori are expected to put out more.  They should be expected to inhale the breath of their superiors else they are being rude.  Fire-able offence.  That's right.</p>

                                <p>MMMMMMM Justice Toogood come closer...  IN the name of cultural safety....</p>

                                <p>I guess. Here is the thing.  You, as a junior, should really appeal to authority with the appriate air of supplication.  And they can tell you, or indicate, what they feel comfortable with.  I mean to say, there should be no expectation that the junior counsel (for example) can offer the judge a blow-job (for example) and that to be deemed, by the judge, to be okay.  You simply can't expect these things you naughty naughty girl.  Only girl they would have considered signing off on -- just kidding!  Lolz.  Actually nobody, at all.</p>

                                <p>  https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/300832213/are-hugs-ok-in-the-workplace-an-employment-lawyers-guide-to-physical-greetings  You know when I feel alright about going in for that blow job (so to speak)???? It's when they are hauling Judges out of retirement to rule in just this kind of a sort of a situation.  That's when I know that I've made it in life.  Everything it was that I value.  Being upheld by the Inustice System.  They are the personlification of injustice.  The superiors lording it over the inferiors with no regard for them or their interests of their concerns whatsoever.  That's the whole meaning point or purpose of the only life worth living right there.</p>

                                <p>I can say 'Hi' Over Skype.  Text message??</p>

                                <p>Oh wow. I can't even say the game 'midnight' without google showing up images of witch burning.  The gist of the game I am talking about is that you have roughly 24 kids and they are around circle and you number them 1-12 so that eveyone has a partner. Then you tell a number and the kids with the same number run around the outside then into the centre and try and tag the centre first.  Then I'm not sure what happens.  But there isn't any witch burning.</p>

                                <p>Contrast this with the games they devised for first year university students to be forced to play for fun as part of social orientation at AUT heatlh campus or similar enviornments..  Where the peak of the game is that everybody in the group identified one member as 'egg' and mocks them relentelssly.  Because it's soooooooooooooooooooooo cmopetitive.  And all.  Until you get sick.  Tehn you realise just how competitive it is in fact.  You lose.  Sorrry.  Bette rluck next generation (not).  You loose.  Hahahahahaha what are you going to do about it?  Answer: Nothing.</p>

                                <p>Hi Mike King.  Uh.  Here is the problem.  If you encourage people to ask for help when they need it, then the problem is that they will have themselves recorded as having asked for help.  Tht indicates to the oppressors that whatever it is that they are doing is working.  They have lists, then, of people who are not doing so well.  They have lists of vulnerable targets.  It is a slippery slope from people being recorded as having asked for help to people being documented as having asked to be put out of their misery.  Being kept in state care institutional enviornments (where various oppressors are paid bonuses for the worse they can keep their ever increasing population).  We don't have Medicine or Psychiatry.  We don't have a Judiciary.  We don't have a Democracy.  There is actually, in actual fact, nothing here.</p>

                                <p>Ruakai.  Where?  Let me google that for you...</p>

                                <p>Duh duh duh duh duh duh don't worry.  All and only those who have established themselves NOT TO BE PACIFISTS shall  be employed to work as medical doctors and teachers and the like.  Roll up!  Roll up! Roll up to be part of the adminstration of the death camps!!!! Only those with demonstrated capability (else inherited worth) need apply!</p>

                                <p>D d d d d d duh duh duh duh duh duhveeeed.. Uh..  Daaaaavieeeeeead..  Uh...  David Lumsden.  Princedon PhD.  Hired to teach Philosophy for University of Waikato because nobody from the Waikato was willing or able to work that job.  H h h h h h h h he w w w w w w w w w w would alway say something about how h h h h h h.  How his local community likely would not have him.  But all of the money they paid into the US I guess they felt obliged to redeploy him somehwere and since the University of Waikato was never going to actually employ anybody from that region (unless they took people with no capacity whatsover to be enrolled in the state university of New Jersey for a time)..  To.. Uh.  Ensure the public school studnet work was handed over to the Private school of Penn for them to re-attribute...  Yeah..  Garbage waste dump of a waste land by design.  Penn I mean.  ANd derivatives thereof.</p>

                                <p>Tozer Henry J page 469 https://www.methodist.org.nz/assets/Whakapapa/Archives/4-Methodist-history/Methodist-Biography-A-Z-29-March-2021-with-introduction-corrected.pdf  Better luck next generation (not -- we have our eyes on you!!!!!)</p>

                                <p>Of course he was also listed next to Reverand Ormond Burton has being no longer acknowledged by the NZ government.  And he did not actually retire to dairy farming.  He retired to pig farming.  And everybody knows that pigs will eat anything.  He had a family (wife Nancy and children Brian, Jenny, and Roger) and who knows what the NZ government officials arrived to feed the pigs with.  I suspect:  His former congregation.  Particularly the men who were drafted to go die in the war, the ones that weren't (or maybe the ones that were) kept in prison or detention camps within NZ.  They were not allowed to have a community of pacifists building houses and the like.  They wanted to keep them in punative environments only and see them off to their untimely deaths.</p>

                                <p>Hey well now don't feel bad.  You had to be a full blown rapist pedophile wrongful deathbringing murderer to be fully ordained.  Right?  Wasn't that the ideal?  Wasn't is a psychopath breeding an dtraining programme?  For everything that we valued (for some other population located far far far away from the people who sign them off)?  No?  Then the baby elephant thing has taken off...  Where the kiddes cannot escape and only those who have given up shall be revered...  All the qualities it is that we value (for other people --onlly when we have the power in fact to get away from the peole we have appointed)</p>

                                <p>Hey, don't worry.  We don't have to pay teachers.  There are no shorateges of volunteers of people who will teach rape camp (and variants thereof) for free.  Yay.  Go public anyting in NZ.</p>

                                <p>Actually, I should be more fully or completely honest.  I went to Hamilton Christian School for the first few years of my life.  After having been taken along to Kindegarten earlier and I actually have (one) memory of pre-school socialisation before that.  So I likely went to pre-school or Plunket group activity or whatever before that.  Hamilton Christian School was wonderful.  I think there were 8 kids there, when I started.  And it grew into two whole classrooms of kids, subsequently.  I think after I left it just kept growing.  Taking international students and so on...  But Leslie..  She was my first teachers.  And I remember she was very kind.  And I learned a lot, I guess.  And I felt that I was part of the class.  I think I saw that..  Collette..  Is there now as a PE teacher.  Wow.  I remember Collette.  I remember that everybody loved games.  Midnight etc.  I hope that it is as good there for the teachers now as I remember it being for the students before.  But then my parents...  I don't know.  Brought more of a property than they likely should have, took me out of that school and put me in Melville Primary which was comparaatively under-resourced, divorced, and things went downhill from there...</p>

                                <p>https://hamiltonchristian.school.nz/about-hcs/history/  Hmm. Well, if that's right, I guess I was there from the ground.  I started at 4 or maybe 4 and a half, you see.  No other school in Hamilton would enrol me at that age.  Mum would take me around to the schools and ask them to enrol me (I was reading already and I really really really wanted to go to school like my older brother) but they would say that I was not understanding meanings or whatever garbage output they would say (that they never stopped saying).  Except for Hamilton Christian School.  I don't know why my parents took me out of there.  Worst decision they ever made.</p>

                                <p>And... Your favorite chocolate bar was Perky Nana.  Huffer makes shorts in that color, in case you didn't know.  And you used to have pet mice.  And I got pet mice, after you had them.  And they were hard to keep, but I remember that about you, anyway.  And various other people from that school.  I remember a lot about then.  I remember a lot about things from a lot earlier than most people seem to.</p>

                                <p>Hmm. So from the staff list now I'm not seeing you.  I'm also not seeing really anything in the way of born in NZ.  I guess just making money off of NZ as a money cow sort of destination.  Keeping of foreign slaves etc.</p>

                                <p>I'm just saying that his trajectory [Shane Reti] doesn't actually make any sense.  Could be replicated by nobody.  Was not plausible, in the first place.  You grow up in, particularly, south Hamilton with the hospital looming over the community.  Biggest hospital in Australasia, apparently.  Most other places (e.g., bigger cities) have multiple, smaller,  hospitals.  More specialist hospitals, even, such that your ambulance will be diverted to this or that hospital depending on what kind or sort of a problem you have.  But the Waikato Hospital is a very very large hospital, covering a rather large service coverage area.  Anyway..  The point really is that the regions of the Waikato that that the Waikato Hospital looms over or above..  Are not ones where is is possible or even slightly plausible that people should rise up from to be part of the administration, or similar.  I mean to say, the State of Iowa has Universities in the vicininty.  But no actual Medical School.  So all of the doctors in training, and all of the doctors after being qualfied (if in fact there are any) are trained out of state and deployed to Iowa.  I mean to say that nobody with any actual ties or connection or early, primary, intermediate..  Experience of the community can actually be part of making the community better.  Why would you want that when you can deploy people with no ties whatsoever to eterminate them.  Or simlar.  I don't know...  They won't train locals...  So foreigners deploy them..  Um.. Well..  What do you expect when you don't think that anybody from there might actually want to help for any kind of intrinsich reason value or motivation that might be worth supporting?  Just a will to die all around or similar.  Extinction plan.  I mean, what do you say?  But really, Shane Reti..  What was your Primary SChool?  Intermediate School?  I'm trying to picture all that.  You don't go to Auckland Medical School after 1 year of study at Waikato.  That's not a plausible trajectory at all.  There is no plan or whatever that allows or provides for that trajectory.  So..  I don't really know what your deal is.  The prevention and prohibiton of medicine for the Waikato one can only suppose.  Except you have been deployed to Whangarei because of, uh, your extensive ties to that community, then?????  ??????  Make no sense...</p>

                                <p>  https://www.hobsonspledge.nz/the_burnt_church_lie_that_won_t_die  Yeah, uh, it's entirely the fault of the Chinese.  And their 'whispers' game.</p>

                                <p>So, uh, this 'exclusive private school' that there supposedly or apparently or allegedly is, now, in Hamilton...  Um.  Well..  Ur..  Let's see the teaching qualificiations or credentials, then, of the faculty on staff.  Because..  Um.. Er..  I'm wondering if they are all foreigners who have no NZ qualifications and if the idea is to continually fail the studnets out (so they pay year after year after year of private school fees) until they day they die.  Really.  If that's the end game here.  For as many years as they are getting away with it.  Do htey have any born in NZ students?  Or are they only making money off of internationals who think they are investing in the education of the next medical doctor for Hamilton (since they don't have any)?</p>

                                <p>  https://e-tangata.co.nz/korero/shane-reti-nationals-rising-star/ Yes yes yes..  But where did you go to Primary School, Shane Reti?  Intermediate?  That's not the usual trajectory to Medical School at Auckland -- am I right??  Your parents aspired for you to go to the University of Waikato and next thing you know you are off to Boston as a 2 year Masters of Public Health student..  Medical Doctor from Auckland...  Um...</p>

                                <p>What Primary School and INtermediate School did Shane Reti go to, then?  He was from Hamilton, right?</p>

                                <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/131517342/meal-kit-company-woop-fined-39000-for-paying-interns-only-half-their-weekly-income  But the money they made in not paying them meant that they had 'discovered' a viable business model.  If you can murder someone and take $100,000 and the courts only take less than that then you are in business!  Depending on your definition of 'business' of course.  The courts do not function. </p>

                                <p>  https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2023/03/china-wants-to-help-new-zealand-recover-from-cyclone-gabrielle-including-financing-constructing-key-infrastructure.html  China was able to build modular hospitals with HVAC etc.  While NZ insisted on keeping people in not fit for purpose quarantine hotels.  Refused to allow China to help build infrastructure.  The trouble is...  That NZ doesn't say that what is happening in China with Uguhar people (etc) is wrong...  I mean to say...  Senior officicals in China likely believe that it is not ideal.  Right?  It is not ideal.  It is regrettable.  If there was a  better way..  THey would persue it..  It is not ideal.  Right?  Whereas the leaders of NZ want to persue it as an ideal.  That's the f*cking problem.  Right?</p>

                                <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/300831788/striking-teacher-having-second-thoughts-a-month-into-the-job  Hmm. I remember being at Melville Primary School where they did some experiment (I suppose) with a 'superclass' where they wanted to merge 2 teachers and 2 classrooms of students into a giant class.  Students were able to say whether they wanted to be in the 'superclass' with the nice teachers who were kind..  Or a regular class.  I remember saying I didn't want to be part of a 'superclass' because it seemed like a big social experiment, really, and I wasn't sure how much learning could actually be done in such a noisy environment.  Now...  I suppose I wonder when they plan on barring the doors and setting the entire building on fire... </p>

                                <p>I would imagine part of the problem is that the anesthetist technicians will have  been told or taught that they were assistants to anesthetists.  So they would have been expecting to be working with trained anesthetists.  But then it turns out they are expected to assist generalists who were picked for that programme on the  basis of who their parents were.  Like how the University of QUeensland is preferentially enrolling the children of the administration and so on (despite their objective rank order score) they are picking their children and people they think might make good breeding partners for their children to enrol them in the Medical Programme.  So, anyway, the point is, the anethetist technicians are able to identify that there is no anesthetist in the OR.. THe..  Well..  There is also no surgeon in the OR.  There might be a 'generalist' they call them.  A 'generalist practitioner'.  A 'GP' who gets sent to an Aboriginal community for training (where they are the only doctor) so they can do anything and everything they have the balls (they would probably put it that way) to get in there and have a go at doing.  So..  For example, pulling the babies out.  Otherwise the mother and or baby and or both will die, you see. They can tell them that, at any rate, and if you don't believe them they can get the judge, then, to tell it to you.  All the general surgeries.  Even things that in the USA, say, you wouldn't be allowed to do unless you were part of specialist orthopedics or whatever training progarmme.  Just get in there.  Saw off the femur and maybe you can leave the patient better off.  Not overtly worse off?  Maybe you can persuade them that they would have died if you haven't have gotten in there and had a go?  Anyway..  THe Anesthetist technicians are probably noticing that there arne't any anesthetists or surgeons, actually, in the OR.  At all.  Maybe the anesthetist technician is supposed to play the role (have a play-school go at it) of being the anesthetist.  Or maybe they are just supposed to watch the surgeon play Lord God and cover up the f*ck ups and crimes.  I don't know how much the operations are actually performed by medical devise representative people who are not even authorised to have scrubbed in, at all.  People with no training at all in health science, I mean to say.  Maybe people with training in engineering or materials to see if they can induce delayed infections or whatever...</p>

                                <p>See, Justice Toogood doesn't have a problem with NZ Universities refusing to enrol, progress through training, graduate students who have met requirements for Degree completion.  He doesn't have a problem with them refusing to graduate students who have done the work for their qualification, particularly.  Of course, they had to get him out of his retirement and put him back on payroll because he was the only game in town.  There was no alternative to him.  Nobody under retirement age had the willingess and or abiltity to work that job, apparently.  They had to keep him on payroll because they couldn't find anybody else who had graduated law school to work that job...  Not until he's dead, I suppose.</p>

                                <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/486076/acute-nationwide-shortage-of-anaesthetic-technicians-a-predictable-problem  They did not 'lose' them they 'eliminated' them.  The students 'worked' the 'job' for free.  Actually, that is not true.  They 'worked' the 'job' while levels of debt were recorded against their name with the IRD only.  Where they would not speak out about the crimes they saw in the OR -  because they understood that if they did they would never be signed off as having completed their qualification.  THey see that there is no justice via the courts.  There is no functioning judiciary.  But their silence was just the start of it.  The start of what they were required to do.  Even if they were silent and did anything anything anything they were asked to do ('work' far more hours than they were supposed to, blow jobs or anything anything anything anything that was asked or demanded of them) they still didn't sign off on completion of their qualification.  They never were going to.  Else, if they did sign off on completion of their qualification, they would never pay them to work that job.  Why would they pay them to work that job when they can force a student to pretend to do the work while also being quiet about any problems while also supplying all of the blow jobs?  Peter Crampton etc etc ensure that they will not fill the advertised positions.  They will re-advertise them (looking for slaves from overseas) else fill them with students else leave them empty by design.  What education and training system?  It was intentionally designed to completely and utterly undermine the whole thing.  The prevention and prohibition of development.  Trajedy of commons.  No working class.  Too many chiefs.  There's nothing there.    Corruption. </p>

                                <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/486064/schools-of-hard-knocks-striking-teachers-struggling-within-the-system  The government has decided that they don't need there to be any more kids, for a while. They don't need to breed a new slave-class, they have enough of a slave-class already, maybe too many people in the present day slave-class, actually.  They have slaves who are still going to be good slaves well into retirement age, so they can skip a generation or two or whatever.  THey can grow slave babies perfectly well (they think) in Fisher and Paykal incubators, anyway.  Implant and harvest he foetus' from in-patients or in-mates or whover held or detained in state care.  Possibly even perhaps without the mother knowing that they have bene used to incubate a baby for them for a time.  There are drugs for that etc.  So, that means, they don't need to train teachers.  They don't need to pay teachers.  They can just apoptose the entire education system.  That way people outside the state care (when the government decides if and when they want to get a baby out of you) won't voluntarily have babies.  So they don't need to worry about education centres and the like.  I would imagine or suppose.  They will not pay the teachers.  They will not acknowledge they have done enough for completion of their training programme etc.  Nothing here.  Just breeding slave people for export.  That's what we do -- right?  Breed herds of people for export?  Supplying meat to the world?   No?  That's not what our leaders have  been deployed into position to ensure the continuance of?  All voluntary-like, of course.</p>

                                <p>Question: How or why did you get interested in Philosophy?  Answer:  I read Plato or Aristotle.  Locke or Berkley or Hume.  I read some of the works of the Philosophers considered good or great, either in the original (if I spoke the language) else in a translation.  And I found that interesting, motivating, inspiring.  Something like that.  So they pay you to teach Philosophy, then?  Well...</p>

                                <p>Here is an idea for a course.  Instead of exposing people to Philosophy and the works of Philosophers what we will do is find examples of really bad arguments.  Wrong claims, and so on.  And we will pack out the curriculum with bad arguments and teach the kids a bunch of names they can sling around to show that they have been educated in Philsophy.  They can take that with them to corporate meetings and community discussions and the like.  They can be all 'wrong!  Fallacy of this' and 'invalid!  Fallacy of that!' and show off their education.  But mostly they can be exposed to bad argument after bad argument after bad argument.  We can show them how badly the reasoning is and how most people don't have the willingness and or ability to argue well (according to us).  Just focus on all the  bad.  Everything bad.  And then see who wants to do another course in Philsophy.  THen, when nobody will voluntarily enrol in a course in Philsophy you can make it compulsory, I guess.  Else just get rid of the whole department.  After it's done it's job teaching people to be oppositional and attach a bunch of labels onto things.  Straw man.  Appeal to authority (unless it's a government appointed, of course) and so on...</p>

                                <p>Sure.  I mean, everybody knows philosophy is a form of therapy.  But what kind of therapy is that?  The cognitive therapy kind where we start by naming all the cognitive distortions and faulty beliefs of the people kept detained and tortured in state care.  If only they could change their thinking they would  be writing about how meaningful their life was and how happy they were to be unlawfully detained in conditions of torture in state care.  They are catastrophising!  Black and white thinking!  Invalid!  Fallacy of this!  Fallacy of that!  Happy!  They are happy!  Oh so happy!</p>

                                <p>So..  You can ask the people paid to teach it...  Would they have taken any more courses in it if their first expsure to the subject had been the course that they are paid to teach and manage?  ANd the answer to that is 'no'.  So I guess they don't have to worry about anybody like that coming through the subject ever again.  Not on their watch.  And they are living the dream.  Right?  Being paid to teach something they love?  No? </p>

                                <p>It would be like trying to have a spelling class where you are allegedly or apparently teaching people how to spell better by presenting to them only examples of incorrect spelling and telling them how bad or wrong it is.  I mean to say...  Instead of doing things properly so that the wrong thing has automatic salience or pop-out they try and expose people to the wrong thing over and over anad over and over and over so that htey will never ever develop the capacity to tell or to distinguish.  The prevention and prohibition of development of whatever it was that they were allegedly or supposed to be about.  What is it about, again? Being able to say that people failed so they will need to pay more and more and  more money to the university for more and more and more..  Uh..  'Training' do we call that?  Until the day the people paid to do that die, apparently.  That's what they were deployed in position to do.  Obstruct and prevent and prohibit.  I guess so that the Northern Hemisphere could redeploy various people from there down here.  Since nobody from NZ has the willingess and or abiltiy to be..  I don't know..  Employed a Philsoophy Academic (need to hire from the US particularly since ours don't get PhD's but even if they did we wouldn't employ them) or Empoyed as Dean of the Research School or even VC of the 'Universitiy'.  Whatever happened to McCutcheon?  THey were promising us a funeral. But they shut up about it when I suggested DNA tests of the identity of the body they were going to present.  Where did he get redeployed to now?</p>

                                <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/131511206/nurse-who-questioned-if-medicine-he-was-providing-to-patients-was-legally-obtained-awarded-23k  How many patients died because of what they were given in the drip?  The heads of drip IV are going to be prosecuted?  They are going to be given medals?  Allll the government external contracts for them.  How much did he have to pay his lawyers?  How much did he have to pay the court in court costs?  Drip IV was so unafraid of the court that they knew they were in the wrong and they chose to invest in lawyers for themselves rather than actually employing NZ doctors to do the scripts from now on.  And Drip IV is likely now going to drag things throught he court of appeal?  Right?  So that anything that was awarded to this guy will be taken.  It is like we take the honest people and murder them.  Wrongful death them.  Refuse to allow them wages.  And we take the violent pedophiles and murderers and sexual offenders and cheats and incompetents and give them all medals.  I wonder who the judge was.  Pulled out of retirement to ensure that the real winner, here, was drip IV.  So they can go on infusing patients with who knows what in the name of medicical treatment or care.  Experimenting on the patients and so on.  Did they have a NZ government external contract did they?  Do they still have the contract?  Pay rises all around, was it?  </p>



                                <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/131505551/surgeons-forced-to-decide-which-patients-have-the-worst-cancer-and-wont-survive-as-crisis-deepens  Good Morning!  Good Morning!  The Genralists ('trained' in Queensland -- hand picked as special, no doubt, like the VC's daughter)  The Genralists said.  (A Generalist is a person they claim to be 'medical doctor' who does their own anasthetics, general surgery, and obstetrics and gynecology.  Largely, best I can figure, because nobody else will work with them.  They send then in to Aboriginal Communities (also Christchurch) to have their funsies on the lowest valued population in the world).  Good Morning!  Good Morning!  The Generalists said, as we met 'em last week on their way to the OR.  Now the patients they greeted are most of 'em dead.  And they're cursing the staff for incompetent swine.  'He's a cherry old card' Grunted Harry to Jack.  (Soooooo preeeeety.  So charasmatic!  Sooooo confident!) As they..  Something something.  But he did for them both by his plan of attack.  Which was clearly and obviously the plan all along.  Though they claim to be soooooooo stupid that nobody saw it coming.  Are they retired yet?  There will be a job for certain other people only over the dead bodies of those grubby grabbing them at present.  I think they have made their position very very very very very very clear.</p>

                                <p>I am trying to imagine the conversation.  'Hi patient x I am Sir Doctor Lord PhD (Honorary) and I am phoning to tell you that if I don't operate on you within the week then you will die by the end of it!'  'I'm sure you can understand that there is no time, at all, for a second opinion on the matter.  You can see that it is my way, else you will be dead within a week.  I am informing you. This is my prediction for you.  I have come to peace with it.  I have updated your medical notes accordingly.  If you don't present for the operation then that will be noted on your file.  You are a dissenting non-cooperator.  Etc.  Have a good day'.</p>

                                <p>You could tell people that about their children.  Then, if they don't present with their children for the only game in town the courts can order the children to be handed over.  Give custory do the Lord God surgeons to do anything anything anything they feel appropriate in the name of medical care.  Order it to be so before a second opinion.  Uplift the kid into state care.  By court order.  So that the Professor Glue Glue Factory and Dr Leeks situations or scenarios can continue on continuing on.  Making NZ a certain special kind of destination location for people to be redeployed to from overseas.  I mean...  We won't process applications to enrol, we won't acknowledge progressions through training. We won't graduate.  We won't employ.  We won't register to practice.  We won't pay.  We will be the detention camp slave camp prison camp for the world by design.  So say our soverign leaders, apparently.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>


                                <p>The Courts and Chris Whelan's Incapacity.  We could start by asking Chris Whelan everything he has done to uphold the quality and integrity of NZ University qualifications.  In the face of the obvous concern that they are functioning as unlawful prison, detention, slave camps.  What is he doing to ensure that they are not these things?  Anything?  Anything?  One meaningful thing?  One meaningful thing to show that graduate student research is being completed in a timely fashion.  That it isn't the case that supervisors regularly cry screaming hissy tantrum fits when it is time to get their studnets work out to externals and the university administration isn't regularly simply refusing to get the studnets work out.  Having studnets work for 1 year qualifications in excess of 2, having students work for 3 year qualifications in excess of 6.  Refusing to allow anybody (who actually wrote their own work) to complete the qualification.  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camps.  There's nothing there.  Chris Whelan has not processed a single complaint of wrongdoing since he was appointed to office in 2014.  They say that there are 'personal problems' in the studnet or between the student and the supervisor and that is why they won't get the students work out for external examination.  So many personal problems. It's not systematic or systemic, at all, it's all entirely personal, apparently.  They then go out of their way to hire pedophiles and psychopaths and people who don't actually do any f*ckign research.  Or people who take their students work, bully them into leaving without credit, put another skin on it, and then pass it off as their own.  Garbage dump of a f*ckign waste land.  By design.  You go Chris Whelan.  Explain to the people a single thing you have done to uphold the quality and integrity of NZ Universities when you haven't processed a single f*ckign complaint of wrongdoing since you have  been appointed to office.  I couldn't imagine what anybody more useless than you could possibly be like..  I'm trying to imagine a single hire or person for the position who could do a worse job of it, than you.  I really can't think of anybody who could  be more f*cking useless.  Unless you want to change places with the Ombudsman who is paid to never see anything wrong?  They replaced him with someone else at some point, right?  Then brought him back because he's great at not seeing anything wrong in the hospitals and the prisons and the schools. When he does say that he sees something wrong we should really be worried then,  becaue of everything he ommmitted.  He gave them weeks notice in advance that he was coming and did not deviate from the route they took him on.  Could you imagine a worse f*cking hire for the position?  It is incapacity, do you think, or belligerence?  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>What happened to Olivia Podmore (in her Special School of Elite Cycling) and what happened to Mason Pendrous (as a First Year Computer Science studnet at Canterbury) was 'entirely personal' which makes it okay?  Seriously?  Come on.  F*ckign hurry up and get with developed world..  Else get the f*ck out of the way.</p>

                                <p>I am remembering a reassurance that was given to a major firm early on (they sent a junior to an early case management conference):  Don't worry, Dear it's not going to be a Jury Trial.</p>

                                <p>I mean to say...  Judges hauled out of retirement (on payroll with nothing to lose) are likely going to make very very very different judgments from the average NZer.  In everything...  From Chris Whelan's fitness for $250,000 ++++ office and more...  I mean to say, I think that being trialed before a Jury of..  Not their peers.  Average NZers.  People hauled at random off of the electoral roll (the what, now?) is more likely to find in the interests of justice than the Judicary.  Hauled out of retirement for..  Um..  Everything it is that... Um..  Una?  Who now?  Everything it is that they value...</p>

                                <p>I just want to remind everyone that Circa contacts..  Blah blah...  It would only cost us $100,000 per year to keep him behind bars.  And then we could pay some other person to uphold the quality and integrity of NZ Universities and we would still likely have $50,000 towards the courts costs..  And that's only accounting for one year of his salary!  COME ON!!!!!</p>

                                <p>I mean.. All that and we would still be laughing to the bank about the profits we'd made.  And it would in fact be grotesquely obscene but for one small point:  The statutory function of the CE of the NZVCC is clear in statue and HE HAS NOT PROCESSED A SINGLE COMPLAINT THAT HE HAS RECIEVED SINCE HAVING BEEN APPOINTED TO THE POSTION IN 2014.  I mean..  FFS.  How f*cking stupid do you take the world to be???  I mean to say that I know people who you would call retarded and this is something else.  This is something different, entirely...</p>

                                <p>Anyway... I ask you one simple question, good members of the jury:  'how can we afford not to?'  Which is, of course, why they would never graduate me ever ever ever ever from Law School...  Or..  Anything else.  Do you see?  Who wants your euthansia drugs.  Roll up roll up.  Who has been signed up for the LD50...  Hello???</p>

                                <p>Ayesha Verral fires someone for not being politically neutral.  But the Minister for Justice and Minister for the Courts both refuse to even so much as remind the Judiciary on expectations for timely Judgment delivery.  They say they can't use political pressure or influence on the Judiciary to remind the Judiciary what it's f*ckign job is, again, since they are refusing to do it.
                                </p>

                                <p>More than 4 months post a substantive hearing on the issue of whether Justice is an Essential Need or not (DUH the courts stayed open during lockdown) the Social Security Appeals Authority still has not delivered a Judgment on the issue.  Apparently they have been off on holiday and they have been off sick.  I see.  That's why they keep me on disability and pay them exhorbitant salaries to not do the job for which they are paid.  All of the money for them, then, to refuse to do the job for which they are paid.  While they keep me on disability, then, refusing to process applications to enrol according to published selection criterion, refusing to acknowledge progression of training.  Refusing to get my work out to external examiners. Refusing to allow external examiners to sign off on completion of research.  They choose to hire Justine Kingsbury and Carolyn Mason as Philosophy Acadmics in NZ Universities.  They say I didn't do enoguh in the 2018 academic year for credit for a 120 point MPhil that I applied to be enrolled in.  University Academics primary function is supposed to be research.  Let's see their research output over the 2018 academic year so we can see who did enough for...  Well, look at the research output I did.  Compare that to their research output over teh comparable period.  Why are they on payroll?  To keep slaves?</p>

                                <p>NZ doesn't appear to have any doctors, nurses, teachers, universiety academics, lawyers, judges..  Nothing there.  You have these people without the willingness and or abiltiy to do the job for which they are paid taking all the money and keeping other people poorly as slaves.  There is nobody home ffs.  Nothing here at all.</p>

                                <p>The GP's will not retire when tehy get to retirement age.  No voluntarily.  They think that by refusing to sign off on completion of anybody else's training they will get to keep their pay packets until the day they die.  Justice Toogood was reappointed from his retirement (which is not the proocess for appointing Judges) so that he could refuse to find anything wrong with the death of Olivia Podmore and Mason Penddrous in State Care.  He didn't see anything wrong.  They wouldn't release Podmore's health records to her parents but they claim she voluntarily suicided.  He rotted for 1 month in a university residential hall and the University was collecting more and more money from having him enrolled when he was f*ckign well dead.  A supposed or apparent High Court Judge who was not appointed by proper process at all declares that he sees nothing wrong.  He can't see anyting wrong.  So they payroll him to find that NZ universities can do anything they want. The Education and Training Act does not apply to them.  They can say they have enrolled whoever they want into whatever qualification they want (send that info to the IRD) they can refuse to get students work out to eternals to keep them reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled.  They can keep false enrolment records and false transcripts and he doesn't see anything wrong.</p>

                                <p>And Justice Toogood can keep getting payrolled to see absolutely nothing wrong with anything teh governmetn does for the next...  50 years?  Until the day he dies, I'm sure.  We don't need to graduate any lawyers.  We can just draw a circle aroundt he present ones and they can collude, then, to never sign off on anybody else therefore the present lot can collect up all the money that there is for that into the indefinate future.  Make hostages of us all.  Until the NZ administration gets taken over by some other country, I suppose.  Because there doesn't appear to be anything at all here.  </p>

                                <p>Corruption.  THey refuse to get rid of people who are unwilling and or unable to do their job.  In fact, that seems to be an essential part of the job description.  I can't imagine anybody doing a  better job of undermining the quality and integrity of NZ Universities than Chris Whelan.  Nothing could be more detrimantal to the quality and integrity of them than throwing away complaints of wrongdoing instead of working to put the wrongs right and build something worth being a part of.  Garbage f*cking stupid-land.  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>There isn't a health system because you have these f*cking idiots without the willingness and / or abiltiy to the do the job thinking that the only way they get to keep their money is by preventing and prohibiting and exterminating anybody who  might competitition for them getting their next pay increase.  There's nothing there.  Overtaken by psychopaths.  Right, Sterelny? The world is so hostile there's only sex and then you die and you seek out and destroy and co-operation so that alllllll of the funding for you only game in town. </p>

                                <p>How many years of thesis writing research work did the ANU take from Dave Wall before he got to the point of being hospitalised?  Then you give glucose before vitamins so he goes into a coma and nearly dies.  Then you wouldn't need to give him his PhD at all. That means you win.  Right?  How many years of thesis writing research work did the ANU take from Carl Brusse before it acknowledged he had done enough for credit for a 3 year or 360 point PhD?  How many years?  How many years of research work does the ANU collect form studnets only to untimley death them and bully them into leaving because...  There's nothign there.  Hey.  If all the people send you their research because they want publications then you can simply delaly it until they are bullied away and reattribute it to people who don't actually do anyting except bully everybody with the willingness and abiltiy to do the f*cking work away.  F*cking horrible bullies.  Nothing there,  hey.  Nothing worth being a part of .  Nothing.</p>
