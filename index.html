                                <p>
                                    I emailed the Vice Chancellor of the Australian National University about various problems including the University not having supplied appropriate supervision to me when I was a PhD Candidate there, and about them not getting my work to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit me being signed off as having completed the requirements of the PhD in a timely fashion.  I also complained that I applied to do another PhD there, in 2022, stating in my application that I'd rather get credit for the work I had done already then start over on a new PhD.  Apparently the reason for them declining my application was because I did not supply to them a writing sample therefore my application was 'incomplete'.  I supplied to them, in my application, a link to my webpage including the writing page with many writing samples on it including a book chapter from Oxford University Press.
                                </p>

                                <p>  The Vice Chancellor has directed me to complaint to two separate Deans, now.  The latter of which seems to be refusing to acknowledge that they have received a formal complaint.  The formal policy that they have on how complaints will be handled doesn't have a deadline on how long they will take to investigate.  Apparently I was supposed to have lodged a complaint about how they mis-handled my application to enrol within 20 days.  But they took more than 20 days to supply me with the reason why they refused my application.  Because of their inability to identify a writing sample when they see it.
                                </p>

                                <p>The Australian National University is a Public University of Australia and the University receives taypayers dollars from the Government to enrol studnets who are eligible etc.  They choose to refuse to process applications, they choose to refuse to supply supervision, they choose to refuse to allow students to be signed off.  It isn't just the University of Auckland, Otago, Waikato.  It is the Australian National University as well!  I don't know if the problems lies with the Judicaries unwillingness / inability to uphold the laws - or whether their corruption problem is limited to the Government (the executive -e.g., the Vice Chancellor's of the Univesrity).  They seem to think their job is to write policy and procedure documents that are designed to delay and postpone.  That other people are required to follow the letter of the laws that they wrote while they themselves are quite above their own laws.  I see where Chris Whelan in his capacity as the Chief Executive of the New Zealand Vice Chancellor's Committee gets the idea from.  
                                </p>

                               

                                <p>
                                The Ministry of Social Development has chosen to use a lawyer to represent themselves and to do their filings for the Social Security Tribunal.  This is to defend their decision to refuse to supply advance benefit payment to a person who the courts have odered pay more than $20,000 security for costs else cases are forced abandoned by the courts rather than progressing through the court of appeal.  You can read the high court judgments for yourself and see how the high court judges (or whatever you call Justice Toogood and Mander who have been pulled out of retirement for the occasion) who refuse to acknowledge facts and refuse to acknowledge evidence and refuse to acknowledge the half of the education act that confers duties or obligations to the universities of New Zealand and the chief executive of the New Zealand Vice Chancellors committee.  Ms Roe is denied a lawyer.  She is to represent herself as a mackenzie friend for herself as she appears before the courts in her own private residence.  I am wondering what the difference is between there actually being a court hearing with an actual judgement delivered by an actual judge and whatever it is that the New Zealand Government seems to think that it is doing.
                                </p> 

                                <p>
                                I mean..  Here is an idea.  Let's not enrol anybody in Law Degrees.  But even if we did, let's not graduate anyone from Law Degrees.  But even if we did let's not hire anyone with a law degree to practice law.  But even if we did we wouldn't pay them.  But even if we did there wouldn't be any courts.  But even if there were there wouldn't be any judges.  There really doesnt' seem to be anything in New Zealand at all.  I'm wondering if there are any psychiatrists (who aren't incarcerated after having been accused of wrongful death-bringing (leave your wife in Hillmorton -- right) or sexual violation (you wouldn't have been approved to immigate to New Zealand and be allowed to pass yourself off as psychiatarist otherwise -- right).  I mean...  There just doesn't seem to be anything here.
                                </p>

                                <p>Mike Hosking says that benefificiaries are paid so much they aren't applying for jobs.  That's the problem.  Huh.  I bet there are more than a few people who would quite like Mike Hoskings job.  His house and car and pay packet.  Quite like to get up however early he does and go in to work and be on TV and get to write things that are published and get to have his face plastered all over TV.  Perhaps we should see how many people on welfare would trade places with Mike Hoskings.  He could have his applications and progressions etc etc repeatedly ignored and denied and declined and have the beneficiary pay packet and see if after 1 month or something he wants that to be the rest of his life or... What he would give.  Sacrifice, in fact, for his old job back where he can complain about how other people don't have any skills and are too lazy to take his pay packet and his privaledges.
                                </p>


                                <p>The Tertiary Education Commission defines a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  
                            <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a>.  Justice Toogood was wrong to have asserted that I tried to complete the qualification 'early' or 'under-time'.  I tried to submit it so that the customary or standard 3 months of external examination and up to 10 weeks of minor changes (typos and grammar) could be fixed up so that the hardcopy could be lodged in the library at the 34 week mark.  That is not 'early'.  That is on time.  The Universities of New Zealand (also the judiciary) don't appear to know what it is or means to get work done on time.  They refuse to allow it.  They aren't a University -- they are a detention camp.  It is like they have had their eyes poked out.
                            </p>

                            <p>The University of Waikato offers a 120 point MPhil qualification.  That means it has been approved by the TEC as being 'right sized'.  The academic quality and integrity people, the NZVCC approved the qualification.  It is listed in the University Calendar.  I applied to be enrolled in it.  The University refuses to allow anybody to complete that qualification, however.  They believe they are entitled to require studnets to work for at least 12 months on their thesis before undergoing an external examination period of up to 3 months.  Since you are required to be enrolled at the end of the external examination period that means that if the examination period takes 3 months then you are required to be enrolled in and pay fees for an enrolment period of 12 months plus 3 months for a total of 15 months.  But it doesn't stop there.  They believe that if the external examiners say anything about changes needing to be made to the substance (e.g., a referene to be added, a section to be moved around) then they are entitled to require the studnet to re-enrol for an additional 6 months and also undergo another external examination period of up to 3 months.  That means another 9 months added.  Basically forcing the student to repeat the f*cking year.  They say that the outcome of what they like to call 'first examination' is always that the student is required to pay fees for another 9 months.  This is fairly inevitable.  That is to say, they offer the 120 point qualification with the expectation that students will end up working for at least 12 months plus 3 months plus 6 months plus 3 months for a total of 24 months (2 years).  What happens then depends a  bit on the university.  Waikato has this 'option' for the university administration whereby the studnet takes another 2 1/2 months to make minor changes.  Find another reference.  Move a comma.  Etc.  The University administration believe they have discretion to force this -- else they can say the studnet failed to meet their requirements and the qualification is withheld.  
                            </p>

                            <p>Here is how much the Inland Revenue now says I owe the New Zealand Government for my 'Education' and 'Training' that are not acknowledged because New Zealand qualifications apparently expire 5 years post-graduation (well, not the Judges law degrees, apparently, but my qualifications have expired): 
  
                            <a href="judicial-review/ird-shot.pdf" target="_self"> $104,663.</a>

                            They have not provided a break-down of what courses they recorded me as having been enrolled in, in what year.  I have transcripts for some years that I will upload.  They acknowledge that I have completed BA(hons) and an MA (I can't tell whether they invoiced 1 year or 2 years or more of fees total for the MA - it looks to me from my transcript that they may have double-billed).  They refuse to acknowledge that I have completed anything since then.  They keep invoicing my student loan -- for courses that I never applied to be enrolled in (changing enrolment dates for more billings for them which make me look like I'm slow).  They take my research work, particularly, and give it to third parties without crediting me (or paying me).  
                            </p>

                            <p>The Education and Training Act 2020 (and previous iterations of the Act) all state that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible to be enrolled in whatever programme they apply to.  The Act states that when a programme is over-subscribed (more applicants than available places) then the University may use a selection criterion.  The University of Auckland published a selection criterion involving GPA, UMAT / UCAT, interview score.  They informed me that they were happy to use the grades from my previously completed qualifications -- so long as I completed a further qualification for the purposes of 'eligibility'.  They said that I was required to complete the MPhil for 'eligibility'.  But this is false.  As a domestic adult I was eligible all along.  THey were therefore required to apply tehir selection criterion to my application regardless of whether or not I had completed a qualification in the last 5 years.  They don't get to decide who is and who is not eligible.  The source of eligibility is the statute and not their discretion.  The University and the courts simply refuse to hear this.  New Zealadn does not appear ot have a functioning judiciary.
                            </p>

                            <p>Otago, too, thinks they get to decide what students they will enroll in what programme for whatever arbitrary (including discrimatory) reasons they want.  They don't believe that international standards apply to them or to their conduct.  Look at the choices they make (e.g., Dr Leeks).  The untrainable qualities that they value.
                            </p>

                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  They aren't progressing the filings. They are refusing to supply applications, refusing to process applications on their academic merits.  Apparently it isn't a matter of public interest how they pick and choose people to pass themsleves off as 'doctors' in our hospitals.
                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  Demanding me to pay more and more and more money to the courts else they force all my cases aborted, or abandoned.  <a href="judicial-review/sc-eyes.pdf" target="_self"> Here is the Judgement of the Supreme Court that I am attempting to appeal on the grounds that it is manifestly grotesquely unjust. </a>  It is like they have their eyes poked out.  Our highest court does not seem to have the conception of justice, at all.  It was the courts decision to delay Roe v University of Waikato proceedings until AFTER Roe v NZVCC and also until AFTER Roe v University of Auckland.  The Judge for Roe v NZVCC made all kinds of pronouncement in his judgment on the matter of Roe v University of Waikato.  That is to say instead of judging the issue he was supposed to be judging (the inaction of Chris Whelan in his capacity as CE of the NZVCC) he thought he would weigh in on whether or not I had done enough for completion of the MPhil Degree.  Clearly that is a matter of the Judge of a different case to decide!  The reasoning seems to be 'we don't choose you, Ms Roe.  If that means we declare you non-person criminal then that is what we do to justify the fact that we don't choose you'.  This country is not even pretending to be rule by law.  It runs on 'exceptions' or 'exemptions' only (that need to be begged, bribed, else stolen) so far as I can see.  The Supreme Court refused to appoint an aimicus to ensure there was no miscarriage of justice.  Refused to appoint a legal aid lawyer to help me with my filings (when I contacted everyone listed for civil on the the civil Legal Aid list and nobody would file the paperwork to help me with any of the cases).  Apparently our Legal Aid system is working.  Who is it working for?  It is working for who?  We do not appear to have a functioning judiciary (tertiary education system, health system).  Where does all the money go?  Apparently they would rather pay 'recruitment officers' and 'marketers' to make it look like we are wanting to hire other things and just continually re-advertise and re-market positions with no actual intention of filling them with paid workers, at all.  This is not a developed nation.  It is too corrupt.

                            <p>
                            It seems to me that the Australian Constition explicitly states that New Zealand is regarded, by them, to be a State of the Federation of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  Australia refuses to honor it's own Constitution.  New Zealand seems to function as a detention camp of Australia only.  That is how the NZ Government chooses to keep the people of New Zealand.
                            </p>

                            <p>Here are  <a href="judicial-review/sup-court-waikato.pdf" target="_self"> My Filings </a>to the Supreme Court regarding the University of Waikato

                            <p>Una Jagose doesn't seem to have the job of instructing Crown Law to prosecute corruption within New Zealand Universities, or within the Judiciary (where judges refuse to accept evidence and where the supreme court punishes people for bringing injustices before the courts).  It seems there is no evidence that they will accept that would attest to corruption.  None of the invoicing information that I provided (e.g., 0.5 EFTS = 120 points = 60 points = indefinate enrolment).  They appear to have complete freedom to do anything they want with impunity.  Our Universities are nothing other than slave or detention camps designed to waste time only by delaying people until they die.  This is not the developed world.  <p> <a href="judicial-review/crown-law.pdf" target="_self"> Blow off response. </a>

                            So, Peter Singer (Princeton -- a land where they don't use Turnitin so their students are free to purchase their work from the system) is coming to New Zealand.  Last time he went to Australia they got the Disability Community (particularly the Down's Syndrome segement and people with learning or intellectual disability) to oppose him because, apparently, he was saying that intellectually handicapped people did not have the right to be treated any better than animals.  My understanding of his line was that people (including intellectually handicapped people) did not have the right to treat animals any worse than people.  That is to say, he was an animal rights advocate that was advocating for better conditions and treatment for animals.  He was not a psychopath that was advocating for worse conditions for people.  He wouldn't condone or approve of how the people in power in Australasia choose to keep many of their people or many of their animals either.  But that doesn't translate to Australasia.  Because of how they like to keep their people and animals both.  Apparently he is coming to New Zealand soon.  He is going to say something about how women should have the right to decide whether or not to have an abortion (including in cases where they know the disability status of the foetus).  I suppose this is as opposed to a situation or circumstance where the government takes information about disability status (e.g., information that a woman with Down's Syndrome was raped in state care) and decides what it is that the woman must do.  E.g., have the baby and then hand it over to the state, or have the DNA testable foetus removed.  It was really interesting for me to learn at Jacinda Ardern's Graduation from Harvard Ceremony that abortion was only decriminalised in New Zealand a couple years ago.  I am pretty sure that, prior to that, New Zealand had one of the highest rates of abortion in the developed world.  I think there were 2 psychiatrists, or something, whose job it was to sign off (without having even met the woman) that the woman was to have an abortion on 'health grounds'.  I don't know how many psychiatrists applied for that job or what you needed to do in order to get that job as a psychiatrist.  I don't suppose that was anything to do with what the woman wanted (we don't have the conception of individuals making up their own mind it is always what the biggest strongest mob of bullies decides is right for you).  Rather, it was about who didn't want evidence of their crimes, I suppose.  They have to go through a lot of people in the hunt for the next Dr Leeks...

                            <p>
                            Shortland Street has been responsible for motivating and inspiring the next generation of healthcare workers (and children of medical doctors and administrators to take up their rightful places) for quite some time.  In first year Public Health tutorials the tutor would talk quite a lot with quite a few of the students about Shortland Street. I was a bit puzzled that people in the first year competitive entry pathway would be more conversational about the health system as they saw it on Shortland Street rather than the health system as they learned about it on Seven Sharp, but Shortland Street seemed to play a very significant role in public education and workforce education as well with respect to what the people expect of a hospital system (it to be staffed by people playing the part, or by actors) and about the level of professionalism and so on.  The show is about the young philandering doctor who goes on to run the hospital and his marriage to the former administrators daughter.  Right?  Apparently it counts as 'local content' in Australia.  Apparently all our New Zealand trained doctors and nurses work overseas.  I don't know that I believe that.  Last I heard Otago wasn't giving people their graduating degree (e.g., they withheld graduation from quite a few Medical Students from Otago on grounds that they refused to acknowledge the completion of their work-experience requirement therefore they were to work as unpaid volunteer slaves in the hospital while paying the university.  Or similar).  I don't know that Australia would sign off on New Zealand graduates since there are no plans to pay skilled graduates to do the skilled work they were trained for.  I am thinking...  The University of Waikato used to have 2 classees of 250 students in first year psychology where most of them wanted one of the 8 places in Clinical Psychology Programme.  But they don't pay any people to be clinical psychologists, really, they employ people they acknowledge as having clinical psychology qualifications to work as administrators or managers.  Basically pushing paper and having meetings and not being paid to work as clinical psychologists with actual patients at all.  The prevention and prohibition of the development of clinical psychology system.

                            It is not appropriate for New Zealand to compare and contrast itself to the USA or to Australia.  The State of New Zealand needs to comprehend it's place in the world.  It is a State of the Federation of Australia.  If it doesn't like the fact that that is what the Constitution of Australia in fact says then it can vote to change the Australian Constitution so that New Zealanders no longer have the rights of Australians (to live and work in Australia and vote in Australia and apply for Government Jobs in Australia and Defence Jobs in Australia and receive healthcare and pensions and government benefits etc).  What is that?  New Zealanders cannot vote in Australian Federal Elections or in any election regarding the Australaian Constitution.  Well, then, I guess New Zealand is just a detention camp of Australia, then.  And New Zealanders are second or third class Australians then.  The appropriate topic for dialogue is whether the great  hierarchy of being has Aboriginal Australans from the Mainland as higher class citizens than the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people from New Zealand, both, or whether Australia is doing any better than New Zealanad when it comes to the state of their own Universities and Hospital System and Judiciary.  Western Australia got Harlene (so she can be sure to enrol the 18  year olds in their Medical Degree so they can get busy doing abortions and the like) and prevent and prohibit the miners etc from getting the healthcare they need since correlation will never be able to proooooove causation when it comes to occupational hazards from the mines.

                            The appropriate comparison class is States.  Is the Public Health System of New Zealand better or worse or much the same as the State Funded Public Health System of the State of North Carolina?  They have about the same number of people.  How about the State of New South Wales?  How about the Australian Outback.  Before Shortland Street motivated and inspired a generation of no speak English immigrants to play doctor in the hospitals of New Zealand (not in Guatamala now and we don't even know where that is so no worried about them checking up on qualifications -- they only  need to know you have a history as a rapist or wrongful-death bringer so you will play act for low to no wages, right?) there was 'The Flying Doctors'.  About what it means to be rural in Australia.  And A Country Practice about what it was to be a GP in the UK.  There's nothing here. But worse than that there's no *try*.  Just a bunch of people committed to exploiting it to their own advantage at the expense of everyone else.

                            <p>Does New Zealand have a base-line signal yet?  If other countries are making for us and sending to us Covid Test Kits with an established 1 in 4 false positive test rate and New Zealand Government says they have administered 250,000 tests over a period of time then what is the base-line signal you would expect from New Zealand with respect to how many positive tests for Covid they have?  Is New Zealand giving a base-line signal yet?  No.  I don't think that we are.  How many people are dying with (not of) Covid, in New Zealand?  Is New Zealand giving a base-line signal yet?  No.  I still don't think that we are.  You can't trust any of the data that you get when there is no base-line signal.  Must be that something is wrong with my maths.  I can't even understand the maths involved in 120 points = 34 weeks = indefinately long enrolment.  I must be stupid.  Intellectually handicapped.  Animals must be treated better than me.  THe ones we breed for food.  Word salad word salad word salad.  The High Court Judgment of Justice Toogood.  It's in the bag with Justice Toogood.  Right?  Check out the base-line signal in the Tenancy Tribunal.  The problem is the mis-match between the skills that people have and the skills that we want.  We don't want reading writing and arithmetic.  We want compliance and early death.  Check out Dr Leeks.  Most valued employee.  Responsible for signing off on how many Psychiatrists over the years.  He was provided with how many interns?  He wrote how many references?
