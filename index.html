 <h3>Hello World!</h3> 
                        <div id="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>
                                This is the first major style update of the site.  I have converted my MA Thesis into HTML.  I think I need to upload this in order to check the links. Maybe because I made them absolute rather than relative.  Hopefully this update won't break anything!  Thanks for bearing with me while I am working through readibility issues and figuring out color options. </p>
           
                                <p>You can contact me via the email address: email@kellyroe.org.
                                Yes, you probably read that correctly, 
                                my email address starts with the word "email".
                                I'll let you copy-paste that into whatever email programme you like. 
                                </p>

                                <p>I have been changing the content around a bit.  I not sure if it is beter for me to refrain from commentary and keep this facts-based or not.  I don't know.</p>

                                <p>If there are 3x as many applicants than there are available places in a programme and many more high quality candidates than they are able to train in any particular year...  Then you would expect that, after 6 applications, you would have received a couple offers of place.  Statistically.  Something is very wrong with Medical Student selection in New Zealand.  I suppose it is because their primary objective is selecting people they think will keep quiet about various things that present-day Dr Leeks and Dr Green etc are currently doing in our Hospitals.  That is to say they aren't interested in selecting people who will help them figure out how to do better.  That is to say they have already made up their minds they are working to cover up past and present abuses.</p>

                                <p>I really don't know what the problem is, in New Zealand.  It is really not supposed to be that hard.  I can't even complete an MPhil in the 'normal' or 'standard' time because the Universities in NZ have got it into their heads that students need to work for 1 year BEFORE SUBMITTING A 120 POINT THESIS FOR EXAMINATION.  Since you are required to be enrolled at the end of the examination period that means they have decided (on administration grounds) that there always will be a forced re-enrolment at the end of graduate research qualifications -- otherwise the student will never be granted the qualification.  That is to say things are ALWAYS FORCED BY ADMINSTRATION to run over-time.</p>

                                <p>I say this is a corrupt practice that amounts to slavery or something like it.  And they just do whatever they want whenever they want because they want and the courts will collect up more and more and more money if you try and complain.</p>

                                <p>I don't really know what it is.  Maybe it is that the courts need to collect up evidence of gross injustice for...  How many years?  10 years?  20 years?  A lifetime?  Several lifetimes?  Before they think they are required to intervene.  Is that how justice is, in New Zealand?  That's the level of injustice that is required before the court will intervene (without cash payments into the court from the victim)?  To ensure that others are suitably motivated and inspired NOT TO BRING cases to the courts (without cash payments into the court from the victim)?  Perhaps that is the ideal of 'justice', in New Zealand.  I don't know.</p>

                                <p>It feels like there are magic words, or something, that I am supposed to say -- but I don't know what those are.  Or maybe it is a feeling.  I am supposed to express...  Hopelessness.  Perhaps I am supposed to accept and embrace hopelessness in order for justice to be something that will be looked at.  I suspect it has something to do with my not commanding a mob.  That I haven't brought other people with me into the court room.  That nobody else has been advocating on my behalf.  That is something that does not go down at all well in New Zealand, particularly.  We are very much attracted to the idea of people having mobs in New Zealand.  Largest tribe wins.  But that isn't justice...</p>

                                <p>I was reading a well-written article about institutional or organisational gaslighting.  By some nurses in Australia.  They were saying about how there can be clues that the organisation isn't willing to look at harmful practices within the organisation or isn't willing to work towards putting them right such that one would be more likely to be victimised by the organisation for speaking up about problems within the organisation that one sees.  They were saying that paying attention to the wording on the complaints policy was a good indicator of whether they took the policy seriously or whether they thought that doing the right thing (or even trying) was entirely optional or discretionary.  They were saying that if you find yourself in an organisation that doesn't take integrity (or similar) seriously -- then you have a couple options.  You can embrace the victim role, I suppose that was sort of what they were saying, else you could look to get out.</p>

                                <p>But the thing is, what does 'get out' actually mean?  Get out of that particular organisation?  Get out of nursing generally?  Get out of Australia?  Get out of living or of life?  There are flocks of migrants about the world...  People flee for a better life.  Some of them flee because they think they will be more valued overseas and they don't have opportunity to contribute to their potential back home.  But more often people find themselves lied to and exploited with no recourse.  So globally barriers or blocks are put up for migration.  To try and help motivate or incentivise people to improve things in their communities rather than fleeing.  Because fleeing is only creating flocks of migrants.  It isn't really helping or solving anything.</p>

                                <p>Of course I hoped that people would assess my applications on their merits and select me -- for the right reasons.  Because they could see strengths and qualities that I would bring to the programme.  But instead they approached my application with closed minds.  With minds already made up.  With minds already made up unfavorably towards me as someone too old and disabled.  My diagnosis means it is analytic or a-priori that I am lacking in empathy and self-care -- right?  You don't need to employ any brain-power to making an assessment on those things.  You can quickly quickly decide.  Just like Moffat quickly quickly decided (after having a chatty chat to various people in the Faculty) that I could not possibly complete 1 year of research within 1 year.  And then after they had said it they were thereby psychologically committed to that being the case.  Then they found themselves forcing that to be the case.  I never had a chance, in other words.  They had already decided.  On the basis of cognitive heuristic.  Jumping to conclusions.  Confirmation bias.  It isn't about discrimination on the basis of age or disability or...  It really doesn't need to be about that.  It is just about...  Not quite 'lazy thinking'.  But automatic thinking.  Or...  Not really thinking.  Closed minded.  Yes.  But the real problem is the unwillingess or imperviousness to new evidence coming in.  That they wouldn't look at other information I was trying to get before them.</p>

                                <p>Of course it is easier if I am the bad guy, here.  Then they can just go on doing whatever they were before with impunity, just like before.</p>

                                <p>You might think that what happened was some kind of delusional thinking.  Where the University could not see that it was going well beyond anything in the reports of examiners to require me to re-enrol for an extended period (forcing things to run over-time) and pay (I do appreciate only a token - but still pay) additional fees.  My MA thesis was about how people can come to delusion as a cognitive way of dealing with complex situations, or similar.  I focused on treatment.  How to help someone who was a bit delusional in thinking become less delusional in thinking.  It involved tending to them.  So why didn't I take time to tend to the people who had already made up their minds about me?  The answer to that is because they have all the power in the situation, here.  They pay them.  They pay them.  They pay them.  They pay them.  They pay them.  They do not pay me.  They pay them to help me.  And they help themselves to me.  They do not pay me to help them.  They have been paying them to prevent and prohibit and obstruct and un-help me.  </p>

                                <p>Chris Whelan (in his position of CE of the NZVCC) has not progressed ANY of the complaints he has received according to the complaints of serious wrong-doing policy (for studnets and former studnets and staff and former staff) since his appointment to the position in early 2014.  Not a single one.  He earns up to $280,000 tax payer dollars per year for his statutory function role in working to uphold the quality and integrity of NZ University qualifications.  How much would we need to pay Chris Whelan to do his job?  I mean what is reasonable to expect, here?  Why should I have to pay thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars to the courts for the fact that he cannot allow an issue to be raised in a meeting of the NZVCC (I offered and said I was formerly on staff) OR to have forwarded my student complaint to police so that they could possibly (even though they likely wouldn't have) forwarded the evience to government prosecutors.  How is this not a gross injustice?</p>

                                <p>Thanks for visiting the site.</p>
