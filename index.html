                            <p>

                            https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/500047/rural-students-face-bigger-climb-to-enter-university
I'm sure Egg has probably heard of 'Cambridge Curriculum'.  That's when the government salaried parents from Hearne Bay or Waiheke or Queenstown send their kids off to private rural boarding schools so they can play polo and if they are still too stupid to get to full fee pay their way to Harvard as international students they'll have to be expedited into Otago in the naaaaaame of equity!  Poor poor them.  Right Eggs?
                        </p>

                        <p>I mean, hey, if the teachers think the kids will pass the NCEA external exams -- then they will expel them from the school, rather than letting them sit the external exams, anyway, right?  I mean, that's what we'll do to them when it's time to get their doctoral theses out for external examination.  It isn't like they let the kids sit the school external exams if they suspect they will actually pass them.  Likely if there is any interference between the kids writing things on the script and the scripts being submitted for external exam the changes will be to make the scripts worse and not better. So they can get more and more money for re re re enrolling them as 'students'.  Right?  Isn't that the way the hostage negotiations goes?  They will need more money to hire someone to be a reader writer to ensure that they fail so that they get more and more and more money to have a reader writer do all their work for them.  Only if they have capacity, of course.  Then they'll never be allowed to sit their exams.  They can take one for the team.  A whole team of people can be payrolled to manage then for more and more and more and more money for the team!  Take one for the team, y'all!</p>

                        <p>Justice Toogood asserted that NZ Universities don't need to have applications from students in order to record that people  have been enrolled, by the University, in courses of the University's choosing.  Justice Toogood didn't see anything wrong with NZ Universities charging whatever they like (the government does not restrict the amount of fees charged) and transfer the amount to the Inland Revenue to be recorded as debt against the 'student's' name.  He didn't see any problem with that.  Of course he was pulled out of retirement (nobody under 65 could possibly be payrolled to work that job) to not see anything wrong with the deaths of Mason Pendrous and Olivia Podmore.  To not see anything wrong with NZ 'Universities' refusing to keep accurate enrolment records.  Not getting theses out for external exam.  Notn allowing externals to sign off on thesis submissions.  NOt keeping accurate enrolment records.  What Universities?  What judiciary?  There's nothing there.</p>

                        <p>The Social Security Appeals Authority refuses to overturn the Ministry of Social Development's judgment that 'justice is not an essential need'.  Justice Toogood was pulled out of his retirement during Covid lockdown.  The courts continued to function to hear civil cases (ones the government refused to prosecute saying they were to be tried by civiliians as civil mattersr).  THey kept going through Covid lockdown as an essential service.  So that Justice Toogood (after the age of compulsory retirement for Judges) could proclaim that NZ doesn't keep universities.  We don't have an education system.  There's nothing there.  THey don't seem to be even trying, at all.</p>

                        <p>For a while I thought the problem was over-population.  That they treat people so poorly because there are too many people.  But I guess Covid showed us that there really aren't that many people here.  THey constantly cry cry cry about how there aren't enoguh people.  We don't have enough people.  Wah wah wah we need to get more and more moeny for more and more re r ere re applicaitons for visa.  Wah wah we don't have any people.  But that's crap.  It isn't that there are too many people.  If people really were scarce there would be a great push to treat what few there are particularly and especially badly.  Just as much as there is when there are deemed to  be too many.  It's just f*ckign psychopaths being f*ckign psychopathic.  It's got nothing at all to do with the number of people that there are or aren't.  </p>

                        <p>Why oh why oh why would anybody help you?  It's soooo competitive.  It's soooo competitive.  Why would any body teach you anything?  Why would any provide medical care for you?  Why would anybody help you?  It's such a hostile world.  It's sooooo competitive.  All we want to hear is `you lose' and `you fail' and `you get sick' and `you die'.  F*cking idiots.  F*cking well ruin everything for us all.  Psychopaths.</p>

                        <p>What Universities?  They can't / won't process applications to enrol or keep accurate enrolment records or graduate their students.  There's nothing there.  What health system?  They won't pay the nurses.  There's nothing there.  What education system?  WHat democracy?</p>

                        <p>Do you think that 5 per cent of the eligible voting population will vote in this 'election'?  I guess we redefine 'eligible' then.  All the 'people' kept in the prisons and the hospitals and the other governemnt instistutions.  No post boxes for them.  What NZ post?  Do they pay the postal delivery workers?  To dump the election post, was  it?  There's nothing there.</p>
