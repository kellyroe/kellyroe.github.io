                                   <p>I'm not proud of the quality of my filings.  What's that Sterelny?  If you treat them badly enough then you can be the only game in town.  Sounds legit.  Who wants to pay money to party party party with Sterelny?  What education and training system?  There isn't anything there.</p>

                                   <p>The entire time I was at the ANU I did not see any student with reports from external examiners.  I did not see any studnet have a publically scheduled oral examination or defence.  What University?  They choose to pay the likes of Sterelny hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year and he can't even  / won't even get his studnets work out for external examination in a timely fashion.  I think it more likely that he was reattributing authorship to people who were already on payroll.  Carl Brusse had to do 2 PhD's, for example.  Not sure who got credit for the first one that he did.  They aren't functioning as an education and training system at all.  They aren't properly processing applications to enrol.  They won't get the studnents work out for external examination.  I didn't see any doctoral graduation celebrations the entire time I was at University House.  They won't even acknowledge applications for employment, half the time (e.g., my application for Post-Doctoral Fellowship at Macquarie).  If you complain they won't sort things out informally.  If you try and complain formally they won't acknowledge or process or progress the complaint.  What education and training system?  There doesn't seem to be anything there.  Who is going to pay money to travel from the Northern Hemisphere to get to party party party with Sterelny?  It just doesn't make any sense, at all.</p>
