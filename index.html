                            <p>DIABLO IV</p>

                            <p>On the one hand: Yay.  I was thinking about maybe playing WOW.  Only, people have been playing WOW for quite some number of years, now, and it always feels, therefore, like I can't catch up.  I mean...  Most people are playing in the end-game.  Right?  And how long will it take a new player to get to end game content?  It is not friendly to new players.  And I guess the player base has been dwindling and.. What are you gonna do???</p>

                            <p>So...  Last Diablo I played was..  By my estimate..  Diablo 1.  I think I did in fact play that...  And got some way through the campaign.  And, well...  It was okay, I guess...  But not really my thing...</p>

                            <p>My thing being...  Mostly...  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_and_Magic_VI:_The_Mandate_of_Heaven  I LOVE this game, in so many ways...</p>

                            <p>Firstly.  You choose your own party.  I liked that.  Other games (Baulders Gate etc, even later versions of the Might and Magic franchise) offer you NPC's that you find along your way that don't start with your party.  Problem.  The first character I choose to play myself turns out to be the same as the first NPC I find.  Boo.  That puts me off the game.  Was it Divinity??  That lets you choose specialisation for the NPC's you find.  Even which NPC's you choose you want to take with you..  Yeah.. I don't know.  I liked heroes for you choosing (what you thought was) a balanced starting party and then going into the game.  I liked that.  I liked my characters because I built them myself.</p>

                            <p>The music was great.  Atomospheric.  Great.  THe character animation sounds were great.  Perfect.  Wonderful.  The real time with pause into turn based combat (for more considered choices of spells and various actions in more difficult fights) was..  Pretty good.  Yeah.  I mean to say..  Elder Scrolls (real time with pause) and Elden Ring and so on...  More action oriented..  There is a different gameplay loop.  And evolution...  Much of Might and Magic was bow bow bow bow (aka shoot shoot shoot shoot) until things got difficult and them pause!!!! Dramatic music!  And then things Got Real.  I mean to say the game-play loop of ARPG's is definately infinately superior...  So...  What do I miss???</p>

                            <p>Wells...</p>

                            <p>(1)  ID Item and ID monster..  These felt like a chore.  Why invest precious skill points in ID Item and ID monster when you could get yourself precious more damage points for example?  In Diablo IV..  What are the boss resistances?  I guess you can google them...  That is how you would know.  But in the game there was a beastariry which would record resistences and information about damage attacks.  Maybe less relevant in the age of Google.. But your players were allowed to make use of the information that they had learned in game, more to the point.  Surely that is what is in fact relevant.  Also ID item...  You could invest precious skill point upgrades in this and ID items you find on the spot..  Else...  It gave you a reason to go back to town and pay someon in town to id the item for you.  If you can't ID it yourself it might possibly actually be really really good.  Oooooh.  All of a sudden porting back to town and getting stuff ID's does not feel like a chore.  It isn't like 'oh..  Full inventory yet again let's go back and sell the crap'.  Rather, you choose to port back early because you just can't wait to see what you may potentially have found...</p>

                            <p>The items visibly looked better.  When they were.  I don't quite know how to say..  But they nailed the point of visibly looking better when it was in fact.  But in order to access the stats you needed to have Id'd it an equiped it on a character with the relevant stats.</p>

                            <p>I don't think any other game has captured much of what I loved about that..  I played their later games and have many fond memories of them, too.  But that franchise has a special place in my heart..  I don't know..  As Deus Ex and Fallout does for Cohh.  This one does for me.</p>

                            <p>Don't get me wrong, games like Elder Scrolls are amazing.  At where I was kept in my life at that time I did not get to play that game until many years after..</p>

                            <p>Another game I feel very fondly about..  Cohh has Everquest..  Well I played Minions of Mirth.  And that game was brilliant.  Apparently some of the Everquest people went there after it took a turn in ways they didnt' like so much.  In Minions of Mirth (terrible name) you got 3 character specialisations per character.  The experince points were allocated such that you were penalised for seondary and tertiary character upgrades.  But you could, effectively, programme a bard.  with one hotkey...  Cast this buff.  Wait 5 seconds (4 seconds cast time) then cast this other buff.. Then wait 3 seconds (2 seconds cast time) cast another buff.  You could write scripts in game for hot keys on Bards, for example.  To do party buffs every 20 or 30 minutes or whatever the cool down was on the one with the most cool down.  It was f*cking awesome...  For the likes of me...</p>

                            <p>ANyway.  Keyboards for consoles.  Please.  The functionality is there.  Stop making the player base be stupid . Pretty stupid reason to buy a PC.  For keyboard.  How low can you go?  Seriously..</p>

                            <p>It is kind of funny (strange not haha) that Cohh says 'one of the few games I did not complete was Temple of Elemental Evil'.  Whereas.   That was one of the few games that I did complete.  I love CohhCarnage and the channel in so many ways.  But he also seems to be the anti-pathasis of me, in so many ways.  Which is also really interesting...  I love watching his channel.  Games I did not even try.  Games I played that I couldn't get a handle on...  I love watching him play..  But how different our preferences are, at the end of the day...  It's great.</p>

                            <p>What else about the game.. Um.  The potions system.  I think better thank elder scrolls.  Nobody is liking picking or collecting animations - I hear you Cohh.  People google information in fact.  Yes.  But, you know what?  You can build into the mechanics of the game the need for (precious precious) skill points to be invested before the characters you are playing can make use of the information in game.  That is the way that resitences etc need to work.  Until your character in game is aware of them they don't take action in fact.  That is a way of prioritising in game exploration / discovery / skill investment points...  Regardless of the players knowledge base.  I think it is a great idea...  Personally.  For whatever that is worth.  Nothing to me.  Obviously.  Pay me later.  Never.  Haha!!!</p>

                            <p>So..  The targeting isn't there.. There is autotargeting.. The issue is that contollers are different from mice.  For example, I tried to pay Fallout 4 on PS5 and I just wanted to shoot my face off (so to speak) because navigating the GUI was sooooooo f*cking painful.  There is an intuitiveness of moving the mouse to the button you want to push on and clicking.  And with controlers moving the cursor around the screen feels like you have a seried of whips beyind the slowest slave ever and it will not f*cking get to position and you want to shoot your face off in frustration (not really, but you understand the point)..  Controllers feel stupid when it comes to aiming to target.  Aiming to buttons to be clicked in GUI.  I undersand much much much work has gone into making that not be the case..  But.. Well...  F*cking hell.  Why not allow / enable both.  Why can't peopple use keybnoard and mouse in console?  Because it costs money to devleop contorlller only GUI.  Sure.  Make the people who don't use or want keyboard and mouse to pay for that, then.  At least allow console players to choose controller and mouse versions of the game if they prefer...</p>

                            <p>I have eto say I don't even want to buy a PC when they try and make controller and mouse be a reason to buy.  They really got no other reason?  That's what they are trying to use to get people to buy PC's?  WTF</p>

                            <p>Sigh. And yes, of course, there is all of that:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG9g2byXR2c  But you did in fact lose me on 'mouse look'</p>

                            <p>________</p>

                            <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/wellbeing/300912649/microdosing-psychedelics-has-benefits-users-say-science-isnt-convinced  People who voluntarily choose to take doses of substance (alcohol, prescription medicines, psychoactive substances etc) say that they find a benefit to taking them.  That that is why they choose to take them, in the doses they choose to take them in.  That seems a no - brainer.  Right?  But science doesn't believe them...  It wants to take control of when it doses them and what doses it doses them with.  Science doesn't know so science knows.  Science will put people into a group with a dose and see what happens.  Science isn't convinced that people know and science doesn't know.  But there is no shortage of people who want to take control.  In the name of science. In the name of medicine.  In the name of helping you.  I mean helping me.  Helping me helping me helping me help myself to you.   </p>

                            <p>If people choose to take doses of substances with friends or whatever to see, then that is one thing...  But when people start trying to force others...  Force them with court orders, even.  In the name of medical science, or whatever.  Or when people who are employed by the government as teachers or lecturers or graders or whatever.  People with power use their position to drug others.  And take them on sexual liberation journeys in the name of helping them helping them help themselves to them..  Things start seeing really rather a lot more sketchy, wouldn't you say?  Really rather obviously so?  That that was why O'Leary and so on were removed from Harvard.  Because the parents of the kids weren't so thrilled about O'Leary encouraging their daughters to take drugs with him and raise their consciousness and sexual liberation and tune in and drop out and so on (no other game in town than O'Leary, obviously, best psychology hire, ever).</p>

                            <p>You have to add to this picture the role that psychiatry testimony is currently playing in the courts of NZ.  People are strongly strongly strongly encouraged or advised to 'voluntarily choose' to sign confession forms.  They are strongly strongly encouraged to do this by the only lawyers the government will payroll.  Else...  Well...   How many people, in NZ, are in jail, waiting for a trail?  How many people, in NZ, have been in jail, waiting for a trial, for longer than the maximum sentance for the crime they have been charged with?  They are 'volunteers' are they?  Voluntarily choosing to be there.  Taking the rap or the blame or the responsibility for a crime. So prosecution wasn't even needed.  No fair trial.  Guilty until proven innocent and no trial.  What judiciary?  Nobody home!!!</p>

                            <p>So, if they don't sign the consent form..  Well..  Use of seclusion was the traditional way of inducing psychosis.  Keep people in conditions of sensory deprivation for long enough and then present them to a jury and get some psychiatrist to say that they are floridly psychotic and not fit to stand trial and the jury sees evidence of florid psychosis.  But people are psychologically pretty robust,  hey.  They are saying that some people in NZ prisons and 'hospitals' and the like have been kept in single cell isolation chambers for more than 1 year.  And still not fit to haul before a jury and claim they are psychotic enough to be indefinately detained in a psychiatric facility for a crime they won't even be charged with.  Not guilty by reason of insanity but signed over to be the...  Property...  Of the only people the government will pay to claim to be 'Psychiatrist'.</p>

                            <p>Punative institutions of abuse.  Nobody wants to hear them say they didn't do it etc.  </p>

                            <p>So...  Given the above context.  Given that they aren't properly processing applications to Medicine, graduation.  That the likes of Dr Leeks was deciding who would and would not be signed off for psychiatry for how many years?  Most valued employee moved to Australia to better facilitate his ongoing work for the government...  Given the above...</p>

                            <p>Given that the hospitals aren't willing and or able to keep accurate health records...  Given that they aren't able to keep records of prescriptions and the like...</p>

                            <p>Well..  Could you imagine much of anything more terrifying than being given doses of LSD (that they claim are 'subclinical' before being tortured?  Before being thrown into isolation?  Before being questioned by the police?  Or people claimig to be who won't show you their identification and registration numbers?  Who won't supply you with a phone to call a lawyer?  Etc etc...  They want to give people LSD.  In the  name of science and medical experimentation and helping me helping me helpilng me help myself to you.  Science and medicine must take control of the situation.</p>

                            <p>There is no medicine because there is no informed consent.</p>

                            <p>They don't believe that NZers have the right not to be subjected to 'medical experimentation'.  Which is not 'medical experimientation' at all, because there is no informed consent.  Torture.  Government institution of abuse.  There isn't anything there.  It is used as a tool of abuse against the people.  What medical doctors?  Where are they?  On payroll?  Really?  They won't pay anybody to work that job.</p>

                            <p>And there is no shortage of people who will pay them, even, to get the opportunity to take control of vulnerable people and take them for everything they have got.</p>

                            <p>Nothing attracts the psyschopaths like vulnerable people.  Taking control of children or animals or students.  Sick people.  Poor people.  People who can be victimised and abused and taken for everything they have and then thrown away.  Replaced with new victims.</p>

                            <p>What health system?  What educaiton system?  What judiciary?  They won't pay teh workers.  Government institutions of abuse.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  Psychopaths.  There's nothing there.</p>


                            <p> https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/auckland-surgeons-must-now-consider-ethnicity-in-prioritising-patients-for-operations-some-are-not-happy/ONGOC263IFCF3LADSRR6VTGQWE/  They already have  been considering ethnicity.  That's how come things are presently as racist as they are.  Because they have  been considering ethnicity.  They will keep the focus on ethnicity and ensure things are kept as racist.  It's scary, actually, how they are going to get these operations done since they haven't been enrolling or training or graduating people from medical or surgical training programmes.  And now they are targeting people on the basis of race to be first up.  Like sending the VC's sons off to go practice on the aborigionals.  Or sending them off as student volnunteers to the Cook Islands. </p>

                            <p>
                                Judge Andrew Nicholls said the assault was “in no way serious” and described it as a “single cuff” to the back of the head.
                            </p>

                            <p>How old is the Judge?  Maybe it is time for him to go.  If the student had have hit the teacher with a "single cuff" to the back of the head and the teacher wanted to press charges against the student or have them expelled and the explusion upheld because of violence from the student (in state care) towards a teacher (employee of the state) then how would the Judge have found do you suppose?  Find in the interests of the one with power and reinforce the place of the victim?  I am serious.  What would have happened if the student had have hit the teacher, similarly, and the teacher wanted to press charges?  There would have been a criminal prosecution -- right?  </p>

                            <p>So now we understand the function of law in society.  It is used as a meechanism of abuse by the state against the people.  Just so as you know.  Pretty hard to do business in this jurisdication, hey.  What business?  What judiciary?  What education and training system?  </p>

                            <p>Yeah, so, in second year philosophy of mind at the University of Waikato (David Lumsden) there was a texbook 'Philosophy of Mind and Cognition' Bradden-Mitchell and Frank Jackson.  I see that it has more recently been re-printed or re-written or whatever.  But we had the original edition of the book as a textbook.  There was a recommended reading list as well, however, and I purchased most of those and made my way through them as well. One of the books on that list was Sterelny and Jackson.  I don't remember what it was called and I don't seem to be able to find it, now.  It was another book in the same series.  White.  Softcover.  There was an evolutionary objection to functionalism that was Kim Sterelny's, I suppose.  A bucket of river water warming in the sun probably instantiates the same functional description as cognition at some level of analysis.  But it was a bit more of a technical book, from memory, to do with information theory and computation etc.  Did Sterelny really truly co-author such a textbook with Frank Jackson?  Really?  I remember meeting him when I was at the ANU as a summer scholar and I said I read the book and enjoyed it (I thought that people typically loved to hear that and loved to chat about their work) -- but he shut me down on that pretty quick.  Doesn't acknowledge anything he wrote more than 5 years ago, or similar.  Whatever.  How old are you now, Sterelny?  When was your 60th, again?  Retirement age is 65, isn't it?  You might have quite a lot of over-payment of salary to return then, right?  How about Melanie?  How old is she?  She still on payroll too?  Wow.  Did the research output of her studnets ever get sent out for external examination, I wonder...  We know that yours didn't.  There was not a single oral defence where doctoral students defended their thesis to external examiners.  Because there thesis was never sent out for external examination at all.  Right?  What education and training programme, indeed.  There isn't anything there.</p>

                            <p>The financial losses that the 'Universities' are reporting are becauase of building depreciation on their studnet slums, correct?  The building is supposed to last for 50 years, is it?  Or 100 years?  So divide the cost of the building over the lifespan of the building and you hemorrhage money.  I'm pretty sure that was what the Health Management guy said, from Otago, about how the Canterbury people could be sure to cry cry cry cry cry cry cry about how much money they were losing, every year, such that they could not would not pay clinical staff to work clinical jobs.</p>

                            <p>They need to look into who is on staff who is 65 or over.  Start with stopping their payrolls.  Time for them to go.  What proportion of people on payroll are 65 or over, would you think?  I actually don't know.  But once you have done that then you have a better idea of what (if anything) is left...  Then...  The Education and Training Act says that the primary function of a University is Research.  If you want to know more about it, ask AUT.  When they transitioned from being a Tech to a University there was much opposition from the other 'Universities'.  So the question of what the difference was (such that AUT could or could not claim to be one) was something that was extensively considered.  The focus was on research.  AUT employed a bunch of researchers, I thought.  E.g., the Millenium Campus and so on...  Segregated them from the teaching aspect...  Physically...  Culturally...  But employ a bunch of researchers they did.  So that they could claim research output.</p>

                            <p>It does not matter what the Statues of NZ have to say regarding the Education and Training Act.  The Tertiary Education Commission.  They simply will not perform their statutory functions.  Won't do it.  It doesn't matter what the laws are.  The courts have made that clear.  The Supreme Court doesn't think it is a matter of public interest.  I guess by that they can only mean 'it is in fact something that is not in the public interest'.  They seem to think (The Supreme Court) that their job is to throw out of court any complaint about things that are not in the publics interest.  Their job is to find against the interests of the public.  What judiciary?  They don't seem to understand their basic function.  Purpose.  How old are they?  Time to get out...</p>

                            <p>Don't worry, they can go on the retirement benefit.  It's like student allowance or unemployment or disabilty of whatever it is they want to keep the working-age people on so that they can stay on payroll over the age of 65.  It's just swapping things around, so the older people can draw on their lifetime of savings rather than the younger people needing to take out a lifetime of debt.  Maybe they could apply to be volunteers.  All those volunteering abroad programmes they want the working-age people to go on to get themsevles further and further in debt while doing unpaid slave work.  Maybe we could send the 65 year old GPs off to the Solomon Islands or whatever to work the dettention camps I mean hospitals I mean prisons I mean schools over there.  Train the next generation.  Why should the younger people have to give up their lives because the 65 +++ people who have greedy grubbed more than 45 years of government payroll for themselves already are too f*cking psychopathic to give someone else a turn.  F*CKING GET OUT!!!!!!</p>

                            <p>Anyway..  Refusing to teach.  They already got rid of NCEA latin.  So nobody studying NZ curriculum could do Latin at tertiary level, ever again.  Killed it.  THey are trying to kill maths.  Languages.  Everything.  Break out the melamine for the gamma babies.  THe parents and grandparents and great grandparents have decided they don't want to retire.  They would rather eat you and keep their salaries until they die.  But they have also made choices that they have made about the state of aged care, who works in it, whether they are paid, the lack of informed consents and the euthanasia drugs..  THey wouldn't have things any other way.</p>

                           

                            <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/programmes/news-extras/story/2018893905/rnz-editorial-audit  I don't know what this is about.  But I am pretty sure that RNZ declared Russia's actions to be unlawful or illegal before the trial had even properly got underway.  Is that a common thing?  The police tell the newspapers that they have caught the criminal and so then guilty until proven innocent?  But never will be.  Either you voluntarily sign the confession else we will get a psychiatrist to say that you are psychotic.  If a jury doesn't find that convincing they can explain about intermittent psychosis that only occurs when juries aren't watching.  Maybe wait until the maximum sentance time has elapsed before even scheduling a case management conference...  What judiciary, eh?  I am surprised that the focus is on stories being edited pro-Russia (apparently) when what was striking, to me, was the presumption of guilt before a trial.  In fact..  Pretty sure I read from some newspaper source that the initiating event was Ukraine shooting down a plane.  In what or whose airspace?  That becomes important.  For obvious reasons, I would have thought.  Anyway...  This is just a red herring...  What we want is to pack up our chlidren and ship them off to Ukraine to go die, right Chris?  So that you can keep being payrolled until you die.  Right?  105 and you can still be payrolled for your government job.  Is the plan to go back to workign for the MInistry after you are done being an elected representative?  Why would you give up working for a Ministry in order to become an elected representative?  I guess he wasn't elected by the people.  The people voted and then there was a bait-and-switch.  Voted for Jacinda, and got Chris.  Where is Jacinda?  Maybe Chris Hipkins ate her.  Maybe she's being kept in his basement?  Why isn't anybody worried abotu where she is??? </p>

                            <p>Here is an invoice from the University of Waikato (that was charged to my Studnet Loan):  file:///Users/kelly/Documents/GitHub/kellyroe.github.io/writing/invoice.pdf</p>

                            <p>Things to note about that invoice:</p>

                            <p>(1)  I didn't apply to do a Philosophy Thesis with the University of Waikato in 2019, at all.  I applied to 120 points 1 EFT PHIL0800 MPhil Thesis with enrolment dates 05-03-2018 - 03-03-2019.  I wrote them a thesis in 2018 and submitted it in September 2018.  They refused to send it out.  October 2018.  They sent the MPhil out for 'doctoral examination'.  Then, in response to examiners reports:  January 2019.  They refused to send that out.  February 2019.  They refused to send that out.</p>

                            <p>(2).  120 points = 0.5 EFTS for PHILO800 Philosophy MPhil Thesis 2019.  </p>

                            <p>(3).  60 points = 0.5 EFTS for PHIL0800 Philosophy MPhil Thesis 2019 5 months of enrolment. </p>

                            <p>(3). 20 points = 0.1667 EFTS for PHIL0800 Philosophy MPhil Thesis 2019 2 months of enrolment.  </p>

                            <p>What does the Tertiary Education Commission say about how Universities are required to report their Stats if they want government funding and if they want to invoice to Student Loans?  They must report them 3 ways.  120 points = 1 EFT = 34 weeks of enrolment including the examination period.  It doesn't say that 120 points = 0.5 EFTS = 60 points = being detained indefinately under the zero fees scheme.  It doesn't say that you can enrol students in programmes of study that they never applied to be enrolled in.  Particularly when they have done the work for the qualification, already.  If you scroll through to page 3 you see that they say tuition feees are owing but will be paid by the NZ Government under 'PhD examination fee waiver (domestic).  I wasn't enrolled in a PhD.  THey had no business sending my 120 point MPhil thesis out for PhD examination in 2018.  They had no business double-billing 2 lots of PhD examination (one in 2018 and then another again in 2019) when I only applied to be enrolled in a 120 point 1 EFT MPhil Degree that should have been completed in time to have enrolled in a different progamme of study (Medicine) in 2019.  I didn't need my grades to be finalised because the MPhil is ungraded the grades were from my Honors Year.  They agreed to use my grades that had already been locked in (then proceeded to refuse to accept the GPA when calculated according to their algorithm) and refused to examine my thesis for the qualification I applied to be enrolled in.</p>

                            <p>This is a letter they got their lawyer to send me:  https://kellyroe.github.io/writing/fees.pdf  Focus on the part that says 'From the 1st July and during the examination period we will keep you fully enrolled under zero fees...'  What part of the zero fees scheme was to apply to graduate research students?  The TEC makes it clear that the enrolment period (for which fees are paid) includes study breaks and examination periods.</p>

                            <p>Neil Quigley (Vice Chancellor of the University of Waikato) does mathematics:</p>

                            <p>https://kellyroe.github.io/writing/squigley.pdf</p>

                            <p>External examiners are paid differently whether they are examining a Masters Thesis or a Doctoral Thesis.  I have the examiners packs that were sent to the examiners that assert this.  I don't know how much money was transferred from the University of Waikato into Caroline Mason's bank account: https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/arts/contact-us/people/carolyn-mason.html (she was one of the external examiners) to know whether she and the Canadian one were paid to examine a Doctoral or Masters thesis (twice)...  But they were provided with cover-pages for their reports that were headed 'doctoral examination'.  I mean to say whether they were paid to examine it as a masters or doctoral thesis the cover-page for their 2018 reports of the thesis made it clear that they were examinining it with respect to acceptability as a doctoral thesis.  Why?  Because no external examiner is going to say that 50,000 words is enough for a PhD.  And the Univesrity of Waikato wanted moooooooore mooooooney.</p>

                            <p>Take Quigley to China with you when you go over there with a trade delegation, Chris Hipkins.  Take him so he can be accountable for how he is billing the 'students'.  I think you will find that they are not keeping accurate records of student enrolments.  Forcing re-enrolment and more and more and more and more fees to be paid because Quigley is a f*cking psychopath.</p>

                            <p>How old is Caroline Mason ffs...  Is she over the age of 65 yet?  Time to retire Caroline.  Get the f*ck out.  Where is all your studnets research then, eh?  All the research outputs you've supervised to timely completion?  Yeah, right. </p>

                            <p>Is Kim Sterelny still on payroll at the Australian National University?  How old is he?  </p>

                            <p>How old was the former speaker of the house sent off to be diplomat of Ireland?</p>
                            
                            <p>How old was Justice Toogood?  Pulled out of retirement to hear Roe v University of Waikato and not see anything wrong with the way they are double billing for studnets, recording enrolments in programmes of study never applied for etc etc etc.</p>

                            <p>NZ was the only place that didn't seem to have any problems with China keeping people in prison camps in the name of training and education.  Can we think hypothetically?  IF this and that sort of thing is going on THEN is that okay?  New Zealand said:  Not any different from anything we are trying to do.  Doing in fact.</p>

                            <p>To be clear.  The US says that you need to have graduated from one of their approved medical schools within 5 years to apply for registration to practice in the US.  Auckland and Otago are currently listed as approved.  I informed them that those are the only 2 Medical Schools in NZ and they are not processing applications to enrol properly.  They are also not processing graduations properly.  E.g., Harlene Hayes was VC at Otago when they decided to withhold graduation from studnets who had internships signed off because they didn't want to pay them to work in the hospitals (when they could have them continue to pay the 'University') and when they did not want to allow them to get away (e.g., by passing USMLE examinations and having employment options overseas).  I asked them if I could sit the examinations without having gone to Medical School.  I can purchase study materials (USMLE books, World Question Bank, etc) and register if and only if I was found competent by their examination process.  They said 'no'.  Which shows you that they don't care about competency.  It's just a money making scummy scam.  I wonder if they even grade the thing properly, at all.  I guess the idea is that you pay money to go to Harvard or wherever because they will give you more direectly the answers that you need to spout in that particular year.  Not even trying to be fair,  hey.</p>

                            <p>Have to wait for various people to die before there will be a job for me, apparently.  They wouldn't have it any other way.  F*cking hurry up and die, then.  I'm sick and f*cking tired of waiting for you to die, then.  Now you want to say I'm too old to have a job at all.  While you are over 65 and still on payroll.  You are supposed to retire at 65.  Many of them have been on government payroll since 20 if not before.  More than 45 years of governmetn payroll and they were too f*cking stupid to plan for their retirement?  GET OUT!!!!!  F*CKING GET OUT!!!!!!!!  GET OUT!!!!!</p>

                            <p>What education and training system?  F*cking psychopaths.  GET OUT!!!!</p>

                            <p>Take the trade delegation to China and explain to them how much money they should pay NZ 'Universities' for education in this country when NZ 'Universities' don't acknowledge their own qualifications 5 years post-graduation.  They think that the value of an education is that it is obsolete 5 years post-graduation.  Factor that in to the cost of the qualification.  That the entire qualification wont be acknowledged even by them, in 5 years.  So say the people over the age of 65 who won't get out.  Busy trying to undermine the Universities entirely by replacing tertiary education curriculum contents with secondary contents with primary contents with no education and training system at all.  There isn't anything there.  </p>

                            <p>Take Chris Whelan with you too.  How old his he?  Take him with you to China so he can explain that what Waikato is doing isnt' anything different from other of the NZ 'Universities' and he doesn't see anything wrong.  Maybe take the Ombudsman as well.  How he can't see anything wrong.  Hell, take Justice Toogood.  </p>

                            <p>It doesn't seem very plausible that Jacinda Ardern chose to walk away from a couple hundred thousand dollars per year in order to be unemployed.  I would think it more likely that text to speech AI got good enough to give an interview of script-bot output that sounded indistinguishable from the real Jacinda (insfoar as there is such a thing) than that anybody, really, would voluntarily walk away from that much money.  You should be grateful when the people voluntarily elect you are their elected Prime Minister?  HOw should you show your gratitude Jacinda?  I would think it more likely Apple made a bot-Avatar of Jacinda reading the script-bot response than that she would voluntarily resign from being Prime Minister.  She really seemed to thrive and flourish on being the centre of attention.  I don't think she would have voluntarily given that up.  That seems unlike her.  Where is she?  Taken into US custody, or is she somewhere else?  Where is Nieve?  She'd be in school now, right?  Where in the world is Nieve in school?  At least we have the Minister of Everything to show us the state of the maths books that may or may not go to the kids up north.  That's a suitable education packet for them, he thinks.  I guess so they can grow up learning about negative numbers and doing Squigley stats.  Can't even keep accurate enrolment records.  Must be something wrong with my math.  Yeah, right.</p>

                            <p>Jacinda look-alike seemed a little shorter with a less prounounced jaw.  You probably don't want to know too much about how they reduce the height (take slices out of the leg bones) of adults or how they alter the shape of the mandible in adults rather than growing children.</p>
