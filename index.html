                                <p>
                                This is my first website.  
                                I made it to self-publish some of my work, 
                                and to document where things are up to with the courts. 
                                </p>

                                <p>My primary intention is to get a functional site up 
                                relatively quickly so that things can be documented here.
                                </p>

                                <p>If you follow one of the PDF links 
                                your computer might download the PDF to your computer.  
                                You may be able to change the settings on your computer, 
                                or in your browser, so that PDFs are displayed within your browser, 
                                rather than being downloaded by default. 
                                I do not think there is anything I can do about how your computer handles PDFs. 
                                </p>

           
                                <p>You can contact me via the email address: email@kellyroe.org.
                                Yes, you probably read that correctly, 
                                my email address starts with the word "email".
                                I'll let you copy-paste that into whatever email programme you like. 
                                </p>

                                <p>Thanks for visiting the site!</p>
