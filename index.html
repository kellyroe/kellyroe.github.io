                                   <p>The entire time I was at the Australian National Univeristy kept enrolled by them as a Doctoral Student I did not see any of the Doctoral Students with reports from external examiners.  I did not see any of the Doctoral Students with publically scheduled oral examinations or defences.  I saw many of them taking up accommodation in their supervisors (or friends of their supervisors) houses.  Once their scholarship payments had ceased but they were still expected to be handing over more and more and more work to their supervisors.  I remember Karen living with Marian and Marion, for example.  Kim laughing about various others needing to go home and live with their parents.  John Matthewson handing over more and more work to Sterelnly while he had moved back to Wellington.  Ben Fraser moving in with his parents.  Handing over more and more and more work to Sterelny.  I didn't see anybody graduate with their PhD from the ANU.  I don't remember seeing anybody in doctoral gowns.  No celebrations at Univesrity House.</p>

                                   <p>What education and training programme?</p>
