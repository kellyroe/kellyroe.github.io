                            <article>
  

    <p>https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2022/11/expert-explains-why-sick-baby-can-t-just-be-given-blood-from-unvaccinated-people.html  It is good Professor Turner got to have a sit down and yakkity yak yak about Professor Turner's fears.  Let's see...  One person can't have cardiac surgery because if one person had it then 100 other people would want it and then 200 people would want it and then everybody would want it and not everybody can have it therefore one person can't have it.  That's a fear.  Oh.  That's not the issue?  Maybe I don't listen so well.  
    </p>

    <p>They can do it in the name of blood doping for cycling.  Autologous donation.  Probably you can't with infants because you can only take so much at a time and there wouldn't be enough time to collect enough.  Not sure about the surgery...  Stenosis was narrowing but the baby's heart and valves and so on will still be growing...  They don't get too upset about murmers in children because the valves are still growing and they often sort themselves out..  Maybe there is scaring and scars won't grow.  ?  I thought they didn't like to replace valves in children because the replacements won't grow so they will need to be replaced again as the child grows...  I don't know... Maybe I don't listen so well...</p>

    <p>I don't know much about blood transfusions / donations in NZ.  I know that they turn away quite a few people.  Saying that a person can't donate because they are a man who has had sex with a man and things like that.  Saying that they can't because they may have  been exposed to mad cow disease.  I don't really understand why they won't let people donate on the grounds that they are apparently higher risk of having blood that might be infected with something.  I mean, they test the blood.  Right?  And it's unprotected sex that puts people at risk of HIV rather than who it is they had sex with (I thought that was what the science was saying).  Because it isn't only men who have had sex with a man who have HIV.  In fact, most people who got HIV in developed western nations got it from...  Blood transfusions.  But apparently they screen the blood now so that can't happen anymore...  I don't know what the issue is.  Maybe the pool the blood before they batch screen or test it.  So they try and reduce the risk before pooling it and batch testing since they would have to throw away the whole batch if the batch tested positive.  Though I guess they could just pool it with a larger vat so it didn't test positive anymore...  I don't know.  Our blood is processed in Melbourne.  Isn't it?  I think but I don't know... They send the slave colony whatever blood they think appropriate for our unique sociocultural environment...  Or something...  Like how previously Australia used to send the blood to the USA for processing. </p>

    <p>I guess the New Zealand Government doesn't have enough babies or children in state care to abuse that they need to go about looking for more kids to take custody of...  Imagine if the Government could take state care of any child whose parents made a decision they did not agree with...  Then give it back once they'd made them take one for the team of five million, or whatever.  Not really safe to have a baby in NZ...  </p>

    <p>I don't know the reasons why the parents want to be more particular about the blood.  If it is based on misunderstanding of science, or what.  Science tells us fairly unequivocally that autologous (self) donation is best.  But it is not so easy to roll it out to the masses.  And most people in the US don't have their own personal repository of organs (or a clone someplace else to be harvested in an emergency) or freezer full of their own blood (unless they are blood doping for sports) or storage facilities for people to freeze things like umbilical cord blood or eggs or whatever for their own personal use down the track (perhaps, as a form of insurance)...  It's just pretty crap that when people feel very strongly about an issue..  The health system doesn't even try and be accommodating.  It's always this snap quick judgment (and once made done done cannot be undone) that it can't happen.  It won't happen.  They are committed to it not happening.  And that's an end to it.  Remembering the stuff around vaccination.  To start with people who wanted a vaccination couldn't have one because they were too busy trying to force people who didn't want one to have one.  THe problem was that everybody wanted one therefore not everyone therefore noone could have one.  NO, that wasn't the problem.  The problem was that everybody had to have one because otherwise nobody would have one.  No..  That's not the problem.  The problem is small minds can only comprehend that what one does everybody must do.  Everybody must be entirely the same expendible replaceable units.  You can't do x because if you got to do x then everybody would have to be forced to do x and that's not sustainable.  Therefore no to you.  Riiiiiight.  Let's do a needs assessment so once we know what it is that you need we can do a better job of persecuting you and keeping you deprived and so on.  Right.  Sure.  I mean, why not when you are getting away with it.  Indeed.   </p>
