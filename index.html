                            <article>

                                <p>
                                The work that I had done in the Philosophy of Psychopathology was all based on the assumption that the aim was to help people in ways they themselves wanted to be helped rather than engaging in a harmful process of abuse.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                So, for example, I was trying to extend work that had been done on delusions and therapy so as to develop therapy for people with delusions in a way that may be experienced, by them and their families and communities, to be helpful to the person presenting for treatment. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                But if the aim or the point or the purpose is to unlawfully detain (in conditions of torture, even), then you can see a different function for diagnosing and 'treating' of delusions.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                New Zealand has been exposed to Psychiatry.  New Zealand has the idea of it.  Such that people present to GPs or the ED, asking for help from Psychiatry, specifically.  They invisage a combination of excluding medical causes, sometimes prescribing medication, and monitoring the prescriptions in conjunction with regular psychotherapy.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                New Zealand does not appear to have Psychiatry.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                On example of this occurred to me in 2020.
                                I presented to the ED of the Auckland City Hospital seeking treatment for a physical complaint.  Previous injury has resulted in disfigured and numb toes.  I had been walking extensively during lock-down and ended up with nails coming off, bacterial infection, and I was concerned about possible hookworm infestation from walking barefoot in the Domain. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I presented to the ED rather than my GP because, at that time, the media was reporting that GPs did not have PPE and, at that point in time, the EDs were relatively empty.
                                </p>  

                                <p>
                                They mocked my concern about parasites.  They  placed an IV line in my arm and held me in a seclusion room under 'duty of care' for more than 12 hours.  There were extensive cords from medical equipment.  There was no natural light.  There was an LED that was strobing and medical equipment with regular intemittent beeps.  I was not allowed to phone the police or a lawyer.  These sorts of sensory deprivation conditions are likely to induce delusions in most people.   
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                They sectioned me for a 5 day observation hold under the Mental Health Act on grounds they believed me to be delusional.  They required me to take who knows what psychotropic medication and there is no medication that was charted for me, at all.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                After 5 days they gave me a form saying I was to be kept under the Mental Health Act with 'voluntary' status.  They refused to allow me to leave for another few days and they asserted that I was choosing to stay voluntarily in the hospital.  I was not.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The problem is not that there isn't enough resources for everybody who wants help to have help.  The problem is the bullying and abuse.  Various people are being unlawfully detained in the hospitals in the name of medical 'treatment' when they don't want to be there.  Various other people are also sent away from the hospitals without medical treatment.  The idea seems to be to only treat the involuntary or some such.  I mean, what do you have to do to train a population to pay taxes without the expectation of social services?  How badly do you have to treat  people before they learn that healthcare is not for them?
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                They would rather treat me like that than enrol me in Medicine and allow me to work as a medical doctor helping people (and only people) who actually want to be helped.  They would be correct that I'm not exactly Dr Leeks 2.0 material.  I never did find Dr Leeks motivating or inspiring.  I never wanted to be like that or be like him.  I never wanted to train under people like that or like him.  https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/hospital-investigated-for-ketamine/2LLD7VJHWXKUVWDRW4B6DYJN6A/  That is not Psychiatry.  This is not a Health System.  They don't see the people presenting as people.  Cattle or lambs to the slaughter.  People who survive in spite of our 'health system'.  Not because of it.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I don't quite understand how the timiming goes.  Is it that they first involuntarily detain people and give them horse tranquiliser and then they get the students taking turns performing 'cervical examination' on a non-consenting patient?  Is that how it goes.  I wonder if you can push the cells along the fallopian tubes and induce endometriosis!  We must science such things!
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The Government does not honor the scope of inquiry that has been set by the UN in the Abuse into State Care inquiry.  It was to be limited in scope specifically so as to see the Government pay the Victims for the Crimes of the Government.  What it established was that the Judiciary punishes the victims for having complained by requiring the victims to pay the courts for the Government's crimes.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The Inquiry into University of Otago Medical Students paying money in exhange for internships to be signed off as complete without them having attended was set by New Zealand and Canberra. They restricted the scope to overseas internships so as not to find corruption within NZ.  They blamed the students for paying for sign off and they did not look at how the University won't sign off on completion of their Degree if they won't pay.  Even if they do pay the University doesn't seem to sign off on completion of their Degree.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                When the Auditor General looks at Universities he does not look at what theses have been accepted by the University (and the enrolment dates) and calibrate that with what they say about the enrolment EFTS and the number of studnets that the University claims to have enrolled in the corresponding period.  The Universities are fabricating Graduate Research numbers and holding a few studnets hostage / to ransom.  Not crediting them for the work that they do.  Trying to bully them into fleeing with no credit.  Not paying out scholarships awarded else not awarding the scholarship funds to any actual recipient.
                                 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The Auditor General is now restriting the scope of inquiry with the DHB's to Children's Psychiatry, specifically.  They aren't looking at how many FTE Psychiatrists there are employed in the DHB's and who those people are.  They need to look into those people and see how many of them have been struck off overseas registers for atrocities.  How many of them haven't (yet) only because of some kind of asylum that seems to have been granted to them by the Courts of New Zealand since the Courts of New Zealand has decided, too, that they would like to abuse the people who Psychiatry has picked out to abuse, as well.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I didn't ask to  be born, here.  It is not fair that around 1/4 of our population is bullied into fleeing New Zealand (the idea is that if you have any brains at all then you will flee New Zealand if you know what is good for you).  What is fair is for the offenders to stand down.  If you aren't willing to work towards the development of New Zealand then you leave.  Get out of the way. 
                                </p>

                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The Court of Appeal has deemed Roe v University of Otago abandoned because Ms Roe failed to pay excess of $7,000 security for costs for the case to be heard on appeal.  They refused to see the matter as being of genuine merit.  They refused to dispense with or reduce security for costs.  Here are the submissions that I filed with the court of appeal:

                                <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  

                                </p>

                                <p>  Here are my submissions for the  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings on grounds that it had already passed judgment on the filings and would not revisit the issue.  The only thing I can do about this, seems to me, is file with the Federal Court of Australia on grounds that it is in their Constitution that New Zealand is an original state of Australia which, therefore means, the Australian Courts have Jurisdiction over the State of New Zealand.  Here is a <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Link </a> to my case for that.  I provide it here so that I don't have to devote my life to the cause. </p>


                                <p>
                                I don't think States are allowed to mint their own coin.  Apparently the NZD is the most trafficked currency in the world so that would explain that.  I guess it is the Australians who get the Canadians to print the plastic money in order to disguise just how pathetic the Australian Government chooses to keep the wages of the people in New Zealand.  If they don't like it perhaps they can be motivated and inspired to work as second class Australians, then?  Pay ya later.  Yeah, right.  The Federal Court of Australia refuses to accept my Community Services Card for waiver of filing fee.  They refuse to accept an urban Auckland address as Australian.  They refuse to allow New Zealanders to vote in Australian Federal Elections and they limit mobility of people by refusing to supply Australian Passports to New Zealanders etc.  Australian Pensions.  Deporting Australians to New Zealand like New Zealand is an off-shore detention camp for Australia.  An on-shore detention camp.  I don't know what this means for taxes.  I found that we do have a capital gains tax.  So the problem, then, is the State Government of New Zealand extorting an exhorbitant amount of tax from the people of New Zealand and not paying any Federal taxes, at all.  That seems to be the problem, then.  At least now we don't have to wait for the New Zealand Government to re-invent all the laws of all the other developed  nations.  Found some laws for y'all.  You are welcome.  Pay me later.  Yeah, right.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                It is true that Aboriginal people are not explicitly acknowledged in the Aussie Constitution.  But no migrant group is named, either, so I don't see that that matters.  It would be nice, of course, if the Constitution was updated to include specific mention of Aboriginal people of Australia.  Also specific mention of the role that the Treaty has played in the Constitution of the State of New Zealand, more in particular.  But I don't see that either of those things are required for the Constitution of Australia to include Aboriginal people as citizens or New Zealanders as citizens, either.  Otherwise, if Australia is determined that New Zealand is not a State of Australia ( so no Federal Australian Funding will go to our Public Schools and Hospitals) then Amend it out of the Constitution.  I don't know what you do about all the Court precedent from all the Judges who didn't seem willing and or able to parse the Australian Constitution.  
                                </p>

                                <p>I do not see how anybody can do business in this Jurisdiction.  The time will come when they demand you pay bribes or exit payments or facilitation payments or work in considerable excess of what you were contracted for.  Then, what are you going to do?  You could meet their demands.  But then, what guarantee would there be that they would honor their new terms?  Why wouldn't they just keep making more and more and more and more demands of you?  Otherwise, you can take them to Court.  But the Courts of New Zealand refuse to uphold the laws of New Zealand.  They refuse to honor obligations to international community in how they interact with people.  I don't see how, given the Courts of New Zealand, people can do business in this jurisdiction.  Where is the justice?
                                </p>

                                <p>I have an idea that I like to call 'clever'.  It goes like this.  Firstly, you offer someone a job.  You lure them with an offer of job.  Then you bully them.  Try and bully them into leaving, 'voluntarily'.  Otherwise you can get rid of them by simply not paying them.  Like how the Government wouldn't pay the teachers near the start of Labors first term.  Just wouldn't pay them.  Payroll would not do it.  Then you require them to hire employment lawyers.  Else they cannot win in the NZ courts because they are pay to play -- right?  And then the only lawyers you will acknowledge, as such, are taught to get their fee from the victims.  So the Universities (for example), as Public, Government, Universities, can get away with not paying the workers.   Not paying the workers.  Not paying the workers.  And then the courts blame the victims of the crime.  Gaslighting.  Making it all be personal against the person.  They are lazy.  They are not competent.  Etc.  Would you like to take up an employment 'opportunity' in New Zealand?
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Why don't the lawyers sue the firms?  The lawyers who are forced to slave in the firms, I mean.  Forced to work more hours than they do.  Either they aren't capable of independently filing else they know that there will be no justice in the Courts of New Zealand.  Would you like to do business with New Zealand?  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                https://www.justice.govt.nz/courts/going-to-court/without-a-lawyer/representing-yourself-civil-district-court/costs-and-disbursements/  Here we have a statement of what can happen regarding costs.  It may interest everyone to know that the Supreme Court regards the 'successful' party to a motion to strike out proceedings to be the party who files it.  Whether the proceedings are struck out or not.  Would you like to do business with New Zealand?  I'm sure the world would be absolutely fascinated to read the written draft deliberations of the judges.  I wonder if they work in Microsoft Word, or...  Windows 10...  I'm making my filings available my filings because it seems to me that the judgments set me up as a straw man only.  They do not acknowledge the weight or force of my filings.  They refuse to accept evidence I supply and they refuse to acknowledge my claims and arguments for the claims.  It's almost like I wrote them a thesis whose content they have chosen to steal for themselves or gift to their friends so they can get credit for it rather than me! 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                So I guess now, what I do, is upload some of the blow-off responses that I've received from various Government agencies or organisations where people are on pay-roll to...  Prevent and obstruct and prohibit the development of the New Zealand people, best I can figure.  The truly motivational and inspirational responses from Human Rights and Privacy and so on organisations.  Various blow-off responses from Ministers.  The solicitor general (Una Jagose) has been pretty quiet since testifying about the instructions that were given / received by Crown Law to destroy and hide evidence and refuse to prosecute offending within the 'Hospital System' of New Zealand.  I have more recent blow-off responses from both the Ombudsman and the Attorney General and the Solicitor General (the Attorney needs to act only under instructions from a Solicitor?)  So that the world can see where all the New Zealand investement money goes.  How it is that the funds that go into helping New Zealand develop are used or utilised by tyrants to support their 'lifestyles' where the people of New Zealand are pissed on on a daily basis in the name of 'trickle down economics'.  Garbage garbage garbage garbage garbage output.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                It is just so disingenous for New Zealand leaders and managers and administration to play dumb all the time.  Cry cry cry cry cry that we don't have people with capacity.  The problem is not that there aren't people with capacity.  The problem is that people grubby grub grub grub their way into positions where they take up all the money in exhange for refusing to allow people with capacity to function.

                                <p>  https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/300584752/head-of-real-estate-agency-spoofed-in-online-billboards-says-they-are-hilarious  It's soooooooo hilarious.  See how much of a BIG MAN you feel when you see the effects of your property-managment or property-ownership on others.  MMmmmmm feels like a BIG MAN.  See how important you are?  Know what else feels or seems really very very important, like that?  Hearing the courts blame the victims for the crimes of the offenders.  MMmmm the crimes of the offenders.  Such a BIG MAN.  Hearing about the invevitable inter-generational consequences of people being a really really really really really really BIG MAN.  That's what it MEEEEEEEEANS to be a BIG MAN.  For the courts to instruct your victims to pay you for the legal costs in involved in you hiring a QC to defend your crimes.  Big Man.  MMMM so big.  Motivating and inspiring people to...  Uh...  Stay the hell away from New Zealand.  Waiting, really for the bombs to drop.  Given the unfortunate state of the leadership and what it is that they value, and all.  You will need to explain to the judge over and over and over about how the crimes are so very very impactful inter-generationally.  That's the point or purpose of the 'courts' in New Zealand.  To really confirm the status of the victims.  Really entrench that.  Really ensure that the only people in New Zealand are people who have no other options and no other choice.  Really do everything you possibly can so that this is the detention camp slave labor facility of the world.

                                <p>New Zealand's low death rate 'from Covid' has been assited from it's very high death rate 'from suicide'.  Sure.  We don't need things like dx tests or autopy...  Trained doctors...  Course not...  Because that's what 'voluntary' meeeeeeeeans.  Of course it does.  People just voluntarily choose to slave for the state only to choose to kill themselves when it's time for them to be paid.  Yeah, right.  Totally plausible and legit.  Sure.  Course.  Did you know that germs *can* cause disease?  Did you ever think about *how* germs cause disease?  You know, some of them make you sick by secreting a toxin.  Others make you sick by getting your body to make an anti-body that goes on to harm your person.  Wow.  Really.  Who would have thought.  How do vaccines work, again?  They get your body making anti-body.  And how do the Covid Screening tests work, again?  They detect the presence of anti-body.  Huh.  So they test who has been vaccinated, then?  No?  Just stay home, people.  Just declare bankruptcy already.  Just slave for the New Zealand Government, people.  Just give them all the fruits of your labor.  They are such BIG MEN.  The administration.  Half a million dollars per year.  I think Ashley Bloomfield earned more than Faucci!!  Wowsers!!!  You really know you are GOOD AT LIFE when you get specially chosen all at our own discretion, like, to be leadership of New Zealand!!!  I mean, if you can make it here you, clearly, wouldn't be allowed to function, anywhere.  I guess there is that...

                                <p>I mean, this is a country where a Prime Minister has his son sent to Yale for a 2 year masters (at taxpayers expense?) so he can devote much of the rest of his career to writing about how the Judiciary is not independent from Parliament.  Judicial Review has no teeth.  The Palmer legacy.  Who is it, excatly, who chooses to pull judges out of retirement (to put them back on payroll) to ignore my filings?  To leave a legacy that there is no justice in the courts of New Zealand?  Watch the 5G coverage of the cases.  See the Judges bow before Justice.  No?  They aren't bowing before Justice?  What's that?  The Victims bow before the Big Man?  There is no justice in the 'courts' of New Zealand?  Who would have thought...  I did not ask to be born, here.
