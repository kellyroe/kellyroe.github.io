                                <p>
                                The work that I had done in the Philosophy of Psychopathology was all  based on the assumption that we were trying to help people in ways they wanted to be helped rather than engaging in a process of harming people.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                So, for example, I was trying to extend work that had been done on delusions so as to help people with delusions not be delusional anymore.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                But if the aim or the point or the purpose is to unlawfully detain (in conditions of torture, even) as many people as you can...  Well, then, you can see a different function, entirely, for the diagnosing and 'treating' of delusions.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                New Zealand has been exposed to Psychiatry.  For example, Dr Melphi from the Sopranoes.  Dr Szasz: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Szasz. New Zealand has the idea of it.  Such that they present to GPs or the ED, asking for help from Psychiatry, specifically.  They invisage a combination of excluding medical problems, prescribing medication where appropriate, and monitoring the prescriptions in conjunction with regular psychotherapy.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                New Zealand does not appear to have Psychiatry.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I presented to the ED of the Auckland City Hospital seeking treatment for a physical complaint.  Previous injury has resulted in disfigured and numb toes.  I had been walking extensively during lock-down and ended up with nails coming off, bacterial infection, and I was concerned about possible hookworm infestation from walking barefoot in the Domain. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I presented to the ED rather than my GP because, at that time, the media was reporting that GPs did not have PPE and, at that point in time, the EDs were relatively empty.
                                </p>  

                                <p>
                                They mocked my concern about parasites.  They  placed an IV line in my arm and held me in a seclusion room under 'duty of care' for more than 12 hours.  There were extensive cords from medical equipment.  There was no natural light.  There was an LED that was strobing and medical equipment with regular intemittent beeps.  I was not allowed to phone the police or a lawyer.  These sorts of sensory deprivation conditions are likely to induce delusions in most people.   
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                They sectioned me for a 5 day observation hold under the Mental Health Act on grounds they believed me to be delusional.  They required me to take medication and there is no medication that was charted for me, at all.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                After 5 days they gave me a form saying I was to be kept under the Mental Health Act with 'voluntary' status.  They refused to allow me to leave and asserted that I was choosing to stay voluntarily in the hospital.  I was not.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The problem is not that there isn't enough resources for everybody who wants help to have help.  The problem is the bullying and abuse.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                They would rather treat me like that than train me to do Medicine.  They would be correct that I'm not exactly Dr Leeks 2.0 material.  I never did find Dr Leeks motivating or inspiring.  I never wanted to be like that or be like him.  I never wanted to train under people like that or like him.  That is not Psychiatry.  This is not a Health System.  They don't see the people presenting as people.  Cattle or lambs to the slaughter.  People survive in spite of our 'health system'.  Not because of it.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The Government does not honor the scope of inquiry that has been set by the UN in the Abuse into State Care inquiry.  It was to be limited in scope specifically so as to see the Government pay the Victims for the Crimes of the Government.  What happened was that the Government tried to expand the scope of the inquiry to make the proceedings unweildy to delay things.  Then what happened was that the Courts thought they would take the opportunity to make the Victims pay the Courts.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The Inquiry into University of Otago Medical Students paying money in exhange for internships to be signed off as complete without them having attended was set by New Zealand and Canberra. They restricted the scope to overseas internships so as not to find corruption within NZ.  They blamed the students for paying for sign off and they did not look at how the University won't sign off on completion of their Degree if they won't pay.  Even if they do pay the University doesn't seem to sign off on completion of their Degree.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The Auditor General did not look at Universities accounting practices around how EFTS, points value of course, enrolment duration, and fees invoiced are not adding up.  Their student enrolment numbers are wrong because they aren't keeping accurate records of EFTS.  They have a few students enrolled who they are pretending are many different students.  The University of Waikato doesn't appear to be paying any students Masters Research Scholarships.  Where are the completed theses (with the enrolment dates) that attest otherwise?  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The Auditor General is now restriting the scope of inquiry to Children's Psychiatry.  They aren't looking at similar information from the DHBs as what they need to look at from the Universities.  That is to say, the FTEs, number of employees in those positions, the amount of money they are paying them.  They are not employing very many specialists to work in the hospitals.  They are not providing the name of the employees they have so that we can check their credentials or discover that they were struck off various registers overseas for atrocities.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I didn't ask to  be born, here.  It is not fair that around 1/4 of our population is bullied into fleeing New Zealand (if you have any brains at all then you will flee New Zealand if you know what is good for you).  What is fair is for the bullies and tyrants to standing down.  They need to let the people with the capacity to do various things function here.  Rather than everyone being held to ransom by bully tyrants.
