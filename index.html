                                <h3>4 November 2022</h3>

                                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUJYXaS7J-Q</p>  The problem is supposed to be that..  Bart Simpson needs to be the next safety inspector of the power plant because...  Homer won't train anybody else.

                                <p>We can call it the 'I'm Hip because of who I'm kins-with' Pipeline Education -> Prison and various Detention Camps up and down the land.  It't like he grows up in a world that's all planned out for him.  What his contriution is allowed to be...  Get in behind, Chris Hipkins!  There's a good boy.  Whose a good boy???  Whose a good boy!!! Yes he is!!! OOoooho yes!!  Yes he is???  Scritch scritch.
                                </p>

                                <p>They won't employ adults.  They will employ the children.  So the children go to work and the adults are forced into 'early retirement'.  They are careful to fiddle the books by recording them as being 'disabled' or 'imprisoned' or 'hospitalised' or anything other than 'unemployed'.  They don't count for the 'unemployment' stats.  Maybe because they positioned security guards outside the work and income offices and declined them entry to the office to prevent them obtaining the application form that they needed.  maybe because they made the online application forms self-contradictory so that the form wouldn't allow them to enter 'submit' without lying which would nullify the application.  Like our university degrees are designed to be, now?  No?  THey aren't?  They aren't little labels given to people to mark out to the world that they are liars and cheaters and plagarisers because that's the only way they will acknowledge that you graduated from new zealand universities?  So that you are unemployable anyplace else in the world.  And also here.  Right?  So that we can put your 14 or 15 or 16 year old to work...  For a couple years.  And then not.  So that the people of New Zealand are progressively trained to mob people on the streets and sell their suits and the contents of their bags an dtheir cars and their housees and so on to the 'high value' tourists for cheap.  That's not everything that we are busy making the world to  be?  That's not the end game?  Evidence to the contrary...
                                </p>

                                <p>Aw, Cohh.  I'm sorry about Letho.  I didn't know.  I haven't been watching the channel lately.  I feel really bad about saying about your hair, now.  I really didn't mean anything by it.  I thought I said it to you at a time when you were your usual chipper bouncy self and it would roll off your back easily -- like how you so very very often handle similar comments by others.  I didn't know that you were having a hard time -- else I never would  have said it.  I actually think it's been looking a bit better lately (it was going through an awkward stage) and I don't really think that anybody will think that you are trying to look like Matt (or not).  Really.  Tyrian...  Tynan..  I couldn't remember.  That's why I called him 'The Dwarf'.  But maybe I shouldn't have. I think the consensus on him is that he's handsom.  The lady's man.  Right?  Yeah...  The personal thing matters sometimes..  That's why they like to advertise a job only to tell you that you didn't get it then readvertise it nearly immediately to show you just how much they personally did not like you.  Just in case there was any question in your mind, at all...</p>

                                <p>The Otago daily times posted something about me actually headed or entitled 'reject reject reject'.  That made it sound all very very personal about me.  In fact, one of the judges said that.  That it was all very personal about me.  It wasn't a systemic or systematic issue, at all, not of public interest to anybody else at all how they are choosing to reject reject me teh reject on very very personal grounds, apparently.  But, of course, that doesn't sit coherently or consistently with the judgement of another of the High Court Judges that the way the University of Waikato chose to not get my thesis to externals so they could force me to re-enrol with limited full time status so that staff weren't laid off, I suppose...  Since they were on payroll to supervise their students but they were intentionally notn supervising their studnets so they could have more and more and more money for more and more and more re-enrolments and re-enrolments and re-enrolments and re-enrolments keeping the same students enrolled.  Clinging to them.  Never letting them go until they have murdered them entirely...  So that new generations of students can see what they are doing to them and make sure they never enrol with tehm in that programme of study.  I wonder how the Philosophy programme at Waikato is doing, now?  I wonder how many people have sought out Justine Kingsbury as their supervisor after seeing (over on the writing page) how she supervised me.  I wonder...  I guess with no graduate student enrolments she'll have to get  busy publishing her own research or something.  I wonder if the peer review people will be as kind to her in their feedback of her as she was to me?  Maybe they will becuase they personally like her.  I don't know.  I wonder what Jacinda Ardern's honorary degree from Harvard did to con-munications majors at the Univesrity of Waikato...  
                                </p>

                                <p>I don't see them advertising jobs for people who get to advertise jobs.  I don't see them advertising jobs for people who get to advertise jobs and then set up interviews and then tell people they have been selected for interview so that New Zealand can collect a bunch of, effectively, tourism dollars (business, I suppose) for them travelling to New Zealand for interview.  Only to decline their application and re-advertise the position the very next day.  That's a good job, right?  You make up a bogus job and then you make up a bunch of bogus advertisements and so on and pay a bunch of money to advertise them about the world.  But of course there is no actual job.  It's just a scummy scam to undermine and disenfranchise people.  Isn't it?  You can tell them that objectively they weren't good enough.  And you can tell people that personally they just weren't liked.  You can give them the message that their application was soooooooo terrible (even after they spend close to $1,000 on late notice flights and hundreds on examination fees and the like, maybe even thousands and thousands and tens of thosands on university courses for training when 'academic potential' was a stated selection criterion )...  Only for them to find out that they were declined and the position re-advertised the very next day...  Or, only to find that 1/3rd of the entire cohort were later refused graduation on grounds that the university refused to accept that the internationl community having signed off on completion of their workplace internships was sufficient for them to meet the internship requirement that the university had approved for them to attend.  That is a f*cking farce of a situation,  hey.  Couldn't be doing anything more to nuke the health system, really?  Can you think of any way to nuke it faster?  I cannot.  But I must be intellectully hndicapped in the brain that I'm not employablel.  ONly govenrment jobs that seem to be hiring is in the provevention nd prohibitnion and stabotage fields, hey.  Nothing nothing nothing at all. That's the end game?  Right?
                                </p>

                                <p>New Zealand is right to go 'ooga booga nuclear power is scary and terrifying and nonononononono keep us away from it'.  I mean, look at how we manage everything else.  Let's make an explicit list of selection criterion (e.g., knowledge of the heatlh system.  Maturity.  Committment to career change).  And then let's disregard and ignore our published selection criterion entirely in favor of...  Uh...  Some kind of a sort of a *gut feeling* that one or more people have...  Best case, I suppose.  Or some sort of a who's your Daddy or your marital parter or how much money you paid in bribes in the worst case.
                                </p>

                                <p>I mean, imagine it...  THe Vice Chancellor's son decides that he watched 'the Simpsons' and he wants to be a nuclear power plant safety inspector *just like Homer*.   I mean, if Homer can do it, then he surely can.  Right?  Right?  Right?  So now we don't even need to publically advertise the job or see about qualifications.  He can just be handed the job and the salary...
                                </p>

                                <p>I do know people who work in extremely lucrative government positions.  THey say that opportunitites just keep on opening up for them.  It is like people keep an eye on when they are looking for the next project or the next contract and positions just seem to open up for them so something always comes up for them and they don't really need to worry about it particularly.  Whereas others are persecuted and bullied out and bullied away.  Jobs continually restructured.  Constantly given the message that they are lucky to have anything at all.  Everything gets restructred lower.  The opposite of growth.  MOre and more and more demanded for less and less and less.  So the children of the elite can be handed everything on a silver platter, apparently.  So they can have nuclear power if one of them cries a screaming tantrum enough for it and then the whole country blows up.  Kaboom.
                                </p>

                                <p>But of course we do have nuclear medicine.  Of course we do.  So the kiddies can play with that.  Some of them.  All specially hand-picked for all the qualities we value.
                                </p>

                                <p>I did say, at some point, that I wanted to see what happened with Otago.  Why they declined my application under 'alterntive'.  I thought that they made the wrong decision.  I thought that if they knew me more personally then they would think that they had made the wrong decision.  What I meant by that was that they had published a selection criterion that they were supposed to be employing.  The selection criterion (for alternative category) made explicit mention of 'academics' including that the 'grades attained were more important than the number of years spent studying'.  THe criterion stated explicitly 'knowledge of the health system' and 'maturity' and 'commitment to career change'.  I mean...  I find it really really really really really really really hard to believe that I score so very badly (30 out of 32 candidates who were interviewed -- where interview, for me, meant flights from Canberra to Dunedin and stay-over in Dunedin).  I find it really really really hard to beleive that I scored so low (compared to other candidates) with respect to their own selection criterion.  Then they say that they did not consider my academics AT ALL because the alternative criterion is not an 'academic pathway'.  
                                </p>

                                <p>The issues seems to be (in upside down and back to front land) that worst is best and best is worst and so on.  I mean to say...  THey are actually selecting for people who are teh complete opposite of what they are stating.  I mean to say, they are selecting for people without any university background (they said that academics was disregarded because they accepted people under 'alternative' who had never studied anything at university, at all).  I suppose they also chose to select the candidates with little to no knowledge of the health system and so on.  The UK people, the UCAT..  THey say it is up to individual universities to decide how they want to use the ethics section of the test.  I think that how NZ Universities chooses to use the ethics section of the test is to 'definate no' anybody who displays honesty and integrity.  I mean to say they intentionally cull from selection people who say that they would report or speak out (to higher ups) wrongdoing that they saw (e.g., cheating or failing to speak with someone so they could understand and potentially learn from what they beleived was someone misadvising or lying to a patient) etc.  That is something that would be relatively easy to check up on.  The honesty and integrity of the NZ selectors, I mean to say.  If they are intentionally trying to select for cheats etc (so that they can exclude them down the track on those same grounds that were essential for their selection).  Part of the whole pathology of selecting only those who you belive easiest to eliminiate or exclude a bit further down the line.  Becaus ethe aim or the goal or the purpose or th epoint...  Is for the people currently collecting up all the money to keep collecing up all of the money because they are the only game in town.   Because it's a money game to them, I can only suppose.  Nobody taught them anything and they aren't interested in learning or developing or working towards things being better, at all.  Are they?  
                                </p>

                                <p>Something is wrong with the milk in auckland.  To start with I thought it was just one supermarket and then just one brand but it seems to be taking over or catching on.  I think they are trying to wean NZ off of dairy by replacing dairy with non-dairy.  Slowly, progressively, thinking that people won't notice.  Or not caring if they do.  Just doing it anyway.  I don't know what they are filling it out with.  Almond milk?  Oat milk?  I don't know.  They don't ingredient list.  So maybe they are filling it out with round-up.  Who knows.  But the milk does not taste like milk, anymore.
                                </p>

                                <p>

                                <p>You should listen to how some people rattle a tin up along Queen Street in Auckland.  I don't know what they have to do to get busking lisences out of the council these days. 
                                </p>

                                </p>

                                <p>I will stop saying 'all heil' x or y or z.  I remember watching some of the...  World Soccer cup?  With a friend who was German.  He cried happy tears (he was really into soccer) and said he had never seen a public display of German Nationalism before.  That it was part of their culture, since WWII to be ashamded.  I guess.  Of being German.  Even though the events transpired before he was born.  
                                </p>

                                <p>What you wear is a very very personal thing.  Some kids are put in suits or similar types of clothes from a very young age.  I understand that.  I probably quite like high neck or polo necks for similar reasons why some guys seem to quite like having a shirt properly buttoned and a tie.  It feels...  Supportive, somehow.  You would feel like something was missing or you weren't properly dressed without it.  Some people find that things like false eyelashes or..  High Heel shoes (particulrly who may feel short and overlooked)..  Help them feel comfortable in their own skin.  We are strange apes for wanting to be clothed.  It's a personal thing.  I don't mean to hate on Seymour or various other peoplel's clothing choice.  I just wish that everybody else had the opportunity to similarly express themselves and express what things they like and what things they feel comfortable in.  I do think there is also a difference,  however, from what a suit was back in teh working class..  And what it has become at present in parliament.  More along the lines of a tail-coat, I would suggest.  The expense, I mean to say...  The laundering bills...  I think that there is really a rather large disconnect between the Wellington bubble and the rest of the people, for sure...  Hair...  Braiding.  Aspects of elements of cultural dress.  It's a personal thing.  But the politicins seem to be wearing special occasion clothes or occasional clothes on a daily basis...  The laundering bills...  The size of the clothing budget...
                                </p>

                                <p>I guess different people feel differently about uniforms.  There can be something nice about not having to worry overly about what to wear.  Just putting your clothes on and getting about your day.  Or pride in getting to wear team clothes, or something.  I guess it is a problem, though, when people think that wearing a suit is something important to them to what makes them feel that they have a meaningful job and somethign important about what it means for them to feel like they have made it and they are successful and feeling happy and good and pleased..  And then what their policies are when it comes to other people getting to have that very same uniform for themself, if they choose.  Particularly when you are politician or government worker..  Talking about, what?  Trying to force people into doing teh jobs that nobody wants to do because teh pay is so bad and the working conditions are so bad and because we (society in some way) looks down upon and treats people like crap who are working those jobs.  I mean...  Insofar as people were suppose dto be greedy grubs sensitive to nd following the trail of money...  If you are having trouble getting workers for certain government jobs (let's be clear) then you need to pay them more.  That's what using money as an incentive was supposed to be for or supposed to do.  Right?  Where will we find the money?  I've found a fair few people who don't seem willing and / or able to do the job for which they are exhorbitantly well remunerated, lately...  I'm sure that there's no shortage of other people besides..  NOthing personal.  It' snot personal.  LIke Trump in season one anyway..  Because of reasons.  People should understand why.  Maybe he went mad with power later.  I don't know..  But Season One was pretty good.  And how he dealt with the issue of mental instability as well.  I mean...  It was possibly racist and sexist both that they had her model that...  But how are you to credibly handle that kind of behavior when it comes to requirements of the position?  NO differently from anything else...
                                </p>

                                <p>It was quite some time ago now that one of the politicians tried to live (with a family I believe) on welfare payments.  I think he lasted 1 week and cut his little experimetn short because his kid got sick and he would have blown the budget to take it to the doctors.  That might have  been just before they made childrens visits free.  Don't know.  Of course he got to take or keep a lot of things so it wasn't really fair...  He got to keep his clothes, for example.  He wasn't given clothes from the homeless shelter.  He wasn't given a work and income clothing grant.  That would be interesting...  The politicians could have a clothing allownce for them to buy work clothes for themselves from.  It would be interesting to see how much money they think is reasonable.  I guess...  Mostly it's about punishing other people though isin't it?  Into working the jobs that nobody wants.  Here's an idea..  If nobody wants to do it then you could pay people more to do it.  Or stop treating them like shit.  Or both.  Who voluntarily chooses to give up a half million dollar per year job?  What are his sons doing now??
                                </p>

                                <p>There she goes...  Wasting her time responding to the fake news.  Someone (author often ommitted) says that Seymour says..  What reason do I have to believe any of that?  None.  None whatsoever.  So....  How are we doign processing my application against the published criteiron then?  Statutory law trumps your local calender regulations.  I am eligible.  Therefore what are the published regulations regarding selection criterion?  What was my rank order score?  NO...  You don't get to calculate my GPA however you like.  There was a published algorithm.  One way of calculating it within your regulations was 8.6.  Enter it into the system properly.  Maybe there is another way of calculating it within your regulations.  You said the 'highest GPA' within teh regulations.  Maybe you can find a way of calculating it so that it was higher than 8.6.  I don't know.  I don't see how to do that.  Apparently the average was 8.0.  But it was worth 40 per cent of the overall score so that small diferences were magnified.  You owe me a training place.  Apparently tehre is suuuuuch a shortage of doctors that it's straightforward to go from selection to graduating.  Right?  I mean...  The govenrmetn keeps the number of training places low and there is an expectation that studnets progress through and complete the training.  No?  Perhaps the aim or the goal or the purpose or the point is to nuke this country to the ground.  Self destruction . Maybe our leaders have decided that it's time for the whole thing to apoptose.

                                <p>I had this sort of faint idea that there were third world or underdeveloped nations somewhere..  Maybe in the South African region or maybe in the Middle East.  Totalitarian autocracies or whatever.  Where...  Where people weren't allowed to submit theses for external examination, say.  I mean, literally.  Where there may be a drop off box or something in the clocktower building where the university administration resides..  And where if you went to walk your thesis across campus to drop it off in the drop off box (in the olden days before it was a federal offence to tamper with the post laugh my f*cking arse off) that they would get the snipers out and make sure that you were shot down before submitting.  Literally.  I mean to say.  LIterally.  Nobody was graduating from that degree.  Or from that University.  Or whatever.  They never received any theses, yous ee.  No creative outputs.  Who would have thought that that would be the situation in New Zealand?  Where they refuse to get theses to external examiners.  Who would have though that that would be the situation in Australia.  Where tehy refuse to get theses or the cndidates state of work after the requisite time) out to externl examienrs.  I mean, refusing to supervise is one thing.  Not meeting with the student.  Not providing any concrete suggestions for improvement of the students work.  Just sort of ignoring the student is one thing...  But not gettin gthe students work to externals..  That's something different entirely...  What do they pay him for?  I guess he made it in life.  Right?  They pay for him to prevent and prohibit the development of philosophy.  I guess.  The University admin says that the philsoophy programme does not have willingness or ability to supervise graduate student research in philosophy.  Right.  I don't know if they enrolle danybody this year..  I wonder if they told them that they were not actually willing or able to supervise them...  But they were planning on invoicing the Australain Government for keeping them enrolled year after yer after year..  Not a University and Training system.  Hey.  Not even trying to be.

                                <p>David Seymour seems to think it would be something of a lark for him to be given a new false name, placed in emergency accommodation, and given a government benefit so he can try and find a flat for himself and apply for jobs for himself.  He thinks that it would be nicer for him to stay on holiday than accept any of the government jobs that the government has decided they will pay people in his position to do (the dangerous jobs, by his own admission?  The ones that they have already decided will be filled with not enough workers so that people are forced to work more than the usual working hours and so on).  Otherwise..  They  need to be deprived even more.  Is that right, Seymour?  Just cut them off from any kind of government benefit at all.  Then they will be forced to beat you down in the streets and steal your stuff and sell it off cheap to the tourists.  No?  How else will they make their living, then?  Is the plan to lock up everybody in New Zealand, then?  You have a few specially chosen people (you, presumably, and your three friends and their 8 children, say, and their 24 grandchildren, say) and everybody else is just to do whatever you say when you say because you say.  Does that sound like a good idea to you?  Good luck flying round on  plane with the only people you allow to drive them and good luck getting an operation with the only people you will allow to do them and good luck...  Well, doing anything at all.  THe babel-land that is New Zealand where they can't even process applications for employment or training or teaching on teh basis of merits.  It's a holday, you reckon?  You do it then.  You do it then and document how life is for you.  Document your will to live.

                                <p>I do hear you about the Flea-bag situation.  Yes, I do.  But I also think that it is important that while we are understanding and empathetic for that kind of situation being the case for some people, for at least some portion of their lives, we not think that those people are incapable of going on to be meaningful contributors.  I mean to say, that once it has been documented that a kitten has had fleas, we don't write it off as being capable of being a trusted companion, around children adn strangers, say.  Because many who have had not very nice starts turn out to be just lovely.  That's why many people specifically want shelter puppies.  Right?  Thte abused ones who (they hope) will be forever grateful whatever sh*it you throw at them -- right?  Hey I nkow..  Why not assess things on their merits around the time?  Oh yeah, because we are too busy being selfish about our own selfish interests.  I don't see any people..  Do you??  Can't even process an application for education and training...  Don't even seem to want a health system.  No self-preservation.  Huh.  Strnge, isn't it how even our leaders don't seem invested at all in developinng a high quality health system.  Just rely on thinking they can get enough money out to go buy nything they want overseas.

                                <p>The laws were changed regarding alcohol advertising.  At some point...  THey were chnged out from under us (as the abortion laws were).  I remember it used to be the case that alcohol advertisements needed to be aired only after a certain time of night.  Once kids were supposed to have gone off to bed (the goodnight kiwi).  And they weren't allowed to advertise alcohol with boating.  So, for example, the ads showing people swimming or boating were not allowed.  I remember ads would be aired and people woudl complain and the ads would come down.  So the laws were changed to allow more widespread alcohol advertising.  So that we have the ads that we are seeing today.  Targeted specifically to children (we used to have laws prohibiting this, but now we don't sem to have those laws anymore?  We are spending time talking yakkity yak yak yak about introducing some?)  Let's work only to see how quickly we can make things worse and worse and worse and worse adn worse then...  Now you see billboards during the middl eof the day.  I mremeber the same fight with cigarette advertising.  They intrdouced laws to get rid of benson and hedges fashion and winfield motor racing.  Was it motor sport? I don't remember.  New Zealand and the USA are the only 2 countries with direct to consumer drug (pharmaceutical) advertising.  Quite the social experiment.  Ask you doctor if methamphetamine derivatives are right for you.

                                <p>Hey...  I know David Seymour.  Or maybe Ashley Bloomfield.  I'm concerned about both of your mental status' (I can say this because I am being facecious and I am not a professional I am trying to get you think about yourself so that you might have some empathy)..  I am concerned about your mental states that you seem to think that resigning from a half million dollar a year job is a good idea...  I am concerned about your mental state that you think that life on government benefit is a holiday (where that is something to be desired).  Maybe you should be locked in the ED for a time..  Maybe locked in the cardiac room (so there are enough cords for you to hang yourself on if you feel that way inclined) with the beeps from the monitors (not attached to you but apparently they don't turn off) and blue-white flourescent flicker..  IN a room for how long??  How many hours?  HOw many days?  How many billable nights for cardiology, was it??  Then into the secure ward for you.  I think that it is Auckland City Mission that donates clothes?  I mean...  YOu wouldn't want to wear a hospital gown forever would you?  They do give you pants so your arse isn't hanging out.  A handy flap for easy front access.  So they can drug you with things that they have no record of having dpsiensed for you from the pharmacy.  Does that sound like a desirable holiday for you?  They will have to take your fancy suit.  The taxpayers dollars aren't going to fund drycleanign expenses for every person in the hospital, now, are they?  City Mission isn't giving anybody suits to wear for their job interveiws.  You will have to make do with whatever they have decided is right for you to wear.  Does that sound liek a nice holiday?  Get rid of the fancy suit...  That proclaims to the world that you are a 'cut above' and what is left??  Now we give you more than 1 year of frictional  unemployment where you hear only that you did not get the job and you see the job being readertised and readertised and readertised..  To give you the message that they would rather the job remain empty than give it to the likes of you.  The people you would rather fill the training places.  The people you would rather put in charge of the flight deck, at the end of the day.  What's that?  I can'at do anything anything anything I like.  I know that.  You are just parrotting or spouting back what you have heard other people say you you.  Right?  That's why peple keep saying that to me?  To justify why I don't get any of the ethings that I've worked for..  And why my work doesn't get assessed according to the relevnat standard.  There's f*cking nothing here.

                                <p>I can say certain things -- because I don't get to have any professional capacity (duty or obligation) at all.  various other people are democratically eleected (supposedly) or hand picked all special because of who their mummy is.  They need to read what's on the teleprompt, or something.  I have no such duty or obligation.

                                <p>Apparently Chris Hipkins believes in "The Kenyan".  It's the name of an ideology that says that NZ Universities are actually employing graders to grade things properly (by objective international standards) such that it would be possible for people in Kenya or China or whatever to ghost write people's work so that people are given passing grades or whatever without having done any of the actual work themselves.  That means to say their examination grades would not have undermined any attempt or effort to employ ghost writers.  Because we don't have examinations, one can only suppose.  Else fraudsters turn up to have their photographic identification card so that the examination invigilators cannot tell that they are not the person on their identification card (like what is supposed to be happening repeatedly and reliably in our hospitals when we don't have any idea who is in the flight deck, so to speak  because our own regional variety of 'standards' means that...)
                                </p>

                                <p>It's funny.  Not really funny.  Disheartening.  Demoralising.  CHris Hipkins prefers to beleive in the possibility of "The Kenyan" that is or means to say that there are people in Kenya and China and so on who have actual abilities nad skills and knowledge such that they could possibly be ghost writers..  He has that much faith in the consistency of our examination process.  Such that it would be possibel for skilled and competent people to sell their services in this manner or way...

                                <p>Imbicel.  That's putting it nicely.  What am I supposed to say or think right now?  The Government believes in peple overseas.  I'm just local garbage.  Right?  The worst of the worst of the worst..  My qualifications don't count but they believe in the existence of 'THe Kenyan' and they speak out about how they don't believe that it is possible for people to pass their degrees in that manner or way.  Of ocusre I actually think that people aren't passing the qualifications in this manner or way.  I think that what is happening is tha tthe scummity scummity scam involves them *not passing anybody at all*.  I mean to say that the most gifted and talented person in the world could enrol in a 1 year masters from Waikato (or auckland or anywhere in nz) and the univesrity would refuse to get their work to external examiners and demand that they pay more and mor eand more and more money only for a period of indefinate detention in conditions every other nation would likely acknowledge or regard as torture.

                                <p>I remember being hospital... When Howard's parents came into the hospital wanting to speak with people to know what happend to their son.  And I didn't speak with them..  But one of the patients told me that they had come..  Seeking answers... And they did not get to speak with me.  And if they had..  I would have told them that Howard told me that his house in the country, it had no heating and no light.  That street kids had broken into his house while he was in hospital and pissed on the floors and the walls and broken the windows.  And he couldn't face going back to his house.  And if they discharged him then he would kill himself.  And that is what he told his psychiatrist.  And no speak English (his only defence) discharged him to his house and then he gassed himself in his car.  And there wasn't anything that I could do.  But that's the story over and over and over and over and over and over and over nd there is never anything that I can do to help.  Because they wnt to kill me too.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49LI6tt-Kp4 and then die die die!!! die die die!!! heil hitler and all that  Thank you india:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1_V-0iDu_0

I mean to say I don't think he was set up more than...  Luxon is clearly or obviously Mullen 2.1 and Collins was Muller with a wig.  Right?  Only Muller..  Had a conscience, or something...

Apple (of California (though not *in* California)) is now making M1 computer chips *In the USA*.  I hear that even the US military uniforms are now made in the USA (the USA could not have previously gone to war with China becauase the US military would have had *nothing to wear*.  I mean - the US Military uniforms were made in China.  Nobody would have credibly thought that there was a war coming between those nations rather than an overarching cooperation or colabborativity to..

                                <p>The speaker should be 3 people.  I don't know how you budget it.  I imagine that the speaker needs a considerable pay decrease (you don't want people wanting the job for the money, you just need it to be financially feasible for people to do the job for the right reasons where the right reasons are other than being rich).  3 is a magic number when it comes to balance of power.  Because 5 is probihibitive and 2 is too few.  3 is a magic number therefore.  There needs to be 3 speakers.  Taking it in turn.  So there is some coverage if one person is sick then one person can cover.  But it isn't that any one person is sacrificing sleep or basic needs in order to cover.  Because you have 3.  That way, also, there is time for the 2 to consider and critique and collude..  ANd learn from the performance of the 1.  To give feedback.  To help improve the overall enterprise.  It mitigates personality clashes (e.g. Cohh Carnage vs Matt Mercer through no fault of their own they are both terrific guys but mostly will not see eye to eye for personal idosyncratic reasons which is fine -- no problem -- but something that needs to be mitigated against)...  So that different people don't feel liek the only one speaker never calls upon them or always goes for certain other favorites.  Or certain locations where they tend to look to for weird resons that it doesn't matter about going into.  NLP for who is the next speaker called to?  Forget it..  Just mix things up. Mix things up..  It is important to have 3.  3 is the magic number becauase 5 is cost prohibitive and 2 is too few.

                                <p>This is one of those issues that people are likely to hate on as 'trivial' -- but I think it is actually important.  I suggest that the fairest way of doing it is a different random assignment for every meeting.  Legimately and seriously...  Pop the names (as the people have written their own names -- typed, perhaps, for clarity) onto the paper and pull them out of the box at random for where they are positioned around the table.  That way people prepare for what they have to say on the merits of it only.  They can't possibly be detracted or distracted or even mindful of the reception (frowns and smiles) that they are likely to receive around the table when they are preparing their postion.  Changing it up every time would also mitigate attempts to collude or any advantage or disadvantage to be had of people being placed even randomly in a hostile or friendly environment.  These things can actually play a considerable role in unconscious bias and it is truely important to mitage over or around those factors so it is possible for people to focus on what is truly important by minimising the irrelevant distrctors (that are supposed to be irrelevant because they upset or interfere with wise or good decision making).

                                <p>A similar thing can happen in laboratory seating for first year science.  Your entire semester is tied to the people around you.  That isn't fair.  It isn't good.  It is better to get people to mix things up.  To encourage them to seek commonality where none may have bene acknowledged before.  To embolden them to speak of differnce where otherwise htey may not have been so empowered.

                                <p>Hahhahahaha check out the 'people', in New Zealand.  Check them out, gnawing each other's arms off.  For how many years they exploited and treated their international students like sh*t.  People invested a lot of money in the New Zealand education system and many of them did want to be honest contributors.  And they were bullied and abused and treated like garbage while they watched how various other people had their progression through training and completion of training expediated and signed off on when they were cheaty cheaty cheaters.  For how long did New Zealand expect to get away with that?  And what did they think was going to happen?  Not much going on between the ears,  hey.  Noppers.  Nothing to see.  Nobody home.  And Australia isn't doing much better.
                                </p>

                                <p>But, really, what is important is that it is up to the indvidual discretion of the leader.  They have unlimited and abosolute power whether they choose to follow best international practice (if they even know what is and why the hell should they?) or if they choose to positoin people around the table by the color of their skin.  I mean, hell, that's whaat it means to lead in NZ, right?  You have the power to do anythign anything anything anything anything.  I mean.. Why the hell else would anybody want to lead, in NZ???
                                </p>

                                <p>Sigh.  Now I have to explain this becuase -- why would you trust me??  What I meant by 'NLP reasons' was that one of the claims of NLP was that different cogntiive facilities or functions were facilitated by (or indicated by) people looking at certain regions of space.  So, I don't know..  Looking in the upper left quadrant meant that one particular cognitive function was happening.  Compared to looking in the middle right, let's say.  I don't know if there is any truth to it...  But suppose there were..  Suppose that people had a tendancy to beleive messages in the lower right quadrant whereas a tenancy to question anyting in the middle left..  Well.  My point was that you could mitiagate against the *possibility* of that kind of undue (irrelevant) influence by..  Dun dun dun dun...  MIxing things up.  Random seating assignments.  So that people don't complain that there's something about being a backbencher in teh upper quadrants, say, that means that one is constantly dismissed...  And ignored..  And the informational contents are not given appropriate weight. By..  Maybe by what is felt to be partiuclarly racaist speaker of the house number 2.  For instance or example.  There.  Nuff 'splaining'.

                                <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/477817/whanganui-flight-school-ready-to-soar.  I bet what is really disappointing for them is learning that even though NZ gives them the qualification (fucking laughting my ass off they haven't graduated anybody since about 2018 -- right???) they aren't given clearance to take off from any jurisdication outside nzl (and that one is entirely at the discretion of..  fuck knows who)..  because they were never trained in the whole pilot safety check-list thing.  so..  no security clearance for take-off.  awwww.  that's an expensive degree to go nowhere on...  But that's okay.  LIkely microsoft flight simulator and a crop plane wil give them all the resources they need to avenge teh situation.  I would suppose . That's the end game here.  Right?? New Zealand.  leading the worl din how to breed terrorist bombers?  Of ocurse it woul dbe racist of me to say so since the photo shows ony brown faces (New Zelaanders aren't good enough for that programme)...  Riiiiight.  That would make *me* racist...   </p>

                                <p>I said about last electron aceptor..  Because I was thnking about how a relative lack of concentration of a product (ATP) was creating a pull for everything...  the electronegative oxygen pulling the electrons towards it, to power the cell metabolic processes.  New Zealand beign a sink hole.  The way the ocean and wind currents push the shit around.  So the garbage ends up here.  That is the myth that our government works so very very very very very very hard to have us believe.  But they also admit that they blew the election campaigning budget out of the water.  They overspent.  Because they wouldnt' have won the election any other way.  That is to say they cheated the f*cking election . They were not democratically elected.  They cheated. And now they are determined to make everybody else in NZ complicit with their crimes.  THey will not have things any other way.  New Zealand must be the garbage that they are working so hard to force it to  be.

                                a better analogy is the misfolded protein.  Prion.  I think there is a crystal version in physics or whatever.  Physical chemistry.  I don't know.  There was a novel that a mexican physicist gave to me, one day.  It was about anti-water, I think it was.  Anyway, the idea of a prion.  A misfolded protein.  And the presence of that is infectious, in a way.  Gets all the other proteins misconfiguring as well.  That's the nature of the toxicity in teh environment that is New Zealand.  Prion disease.  For sure.  Kuru.  They don't say much about it in the USMLE study books and so on.  I guess because it's probably still military classified information.  How they build incredibly toxic sinkholes like Australasia.  Everybody is gnawing each others arms off in these parts.  All heil the monumental doctor leeks the mighty monument to medicine (nobody else was eligible to have applied) and all heil Dawkins selfish genes!!

                                <p>The Australian UMAT test (which has since been ditched or dumped.  Not sure why.  Maybe because it became glaringly obviously apparent that it was a scummy scam designed to scummy scam)?  On the very very first page of the test..  Instead of having this message about how the NCEA is determining your future (that some of you won't have your examination book acknoweldged as received by the person paied to supervise you through the examination.  It is not their job to take your best attempt at a completed booklet and get it to external examiners for external examination within the time for the examination).  Nonononono silly silly girl.  That is not what they are on payroll to do (at the very least) teh supervisors job is not to take the work from teh studnet and get it to the external examiner.  It is to go nononononononono keep working on it keep working on it keep working on it keep working on it I will not accept a examination from you keep working slave keep working slave.  So I can take your booklet and then write someone else's name on the front cover and hahahahhahahahahhaha that's what they pay me to do.  The only thing they would pay me to do.  I suppose.  Is that it?  Is that it, then?  
                                </p>

                                <p>The front book examination cover for the UMAT asked a couple questions that htey said were optional (as oppsed to all lthe other questions one can only suppose).  One year they ask about whether you paid for tutoring services.  Now, the UMAT preparation peopel would tell people when you paid them money to sign up for the examiantion that they did not endorse and they recommended against you paying for tutoring services.  So then how did htey use the answer to that on the front cover?  My guess would be that since they are completely and utterly lackign in honesty and integrity..  What...  What did they teach teh students to say?  Some of the residential halls e.g., Knox provided UMAT tutoring services within the residential hall.  I suppose the kids are told to disregard or ignore any written instructions and huddle in with their herd?  Is that what they are selecting for?  Or do they teach them to say 'no' these don't count as tutoring services because we provide them to you for free you aren't paying thousands of dollars for the tutoring services (that are run by employees of the people who are paid to write the exams in Australia, I would suppose, or their friends and family).  Right?  That's how we prevent and prohibit the developmetn of medicine in Australasia?  But now that's replaced by the UK one.  Because they have a great plan of how they are going to prevent and prohibit the development of Medicien in Australasia.  Is that the plan?  Nobody home. Nothing to see. It may  be true that people from China and Kenya are being paid (maybe even that they make a living) selling answers to university content...  But it is important to acknowledge that the solution is not in 'better internet security' or whatever bullshit.  The problem is that NZ refuses to pay workers, refuses to progress peple through training, refuses to interact with peopel honestly.  They themselves choose to exploit the scummy scam for everything they can on the path to ruining things for us all.  The University itself chooses to pay second year students next to nothing and gives them the anaswers to the first year content.  I would imagine that their being signed off as having completed their second year training would be depenndent on them handing over the quesetions and answers to the first years.  No?  That's how we can ensure we populate our hosptials with the likes of the next Dr Leeks and so on.  Right?  We wouldn't have things any other way.  ALl of the lengths we go to to ensure we dno't have any education or training.  Scummity scummity scam.  What a f*cking farce of a hoax.  Where is my worthless degree?  It' sworthless because of the worthless University system that it comes from.  Look at all the people they give degrees to..  THey just give them away.  To all fo tohe fucking cheats and so on.  All of the fucking cheats are preferable to me.  Well fucking done, New Zealand.  Arsehole of the fucking globe. Is all it fucking wants to be.  WHere is the next Dr Leeks!!  Find him find him find him great monument to Medicine!!! ALl heil Dawkins selfish genes.  
                                </p>

                                <p>My Medical Interview for University of Auckland they asked me specifically how I would react if someone asked me to tell them the questions or answers I remembered from whatever test so that they could use that information to help tutor some students.  I said I would report them for misconduct becuase they were ruining the integrity of the test and ruining the whole thing.  They don't choose me for Medicine because they think that the intergrity of Medicien depends on them choosing to not choose me, or something.  But then Crimson Education (shining beacon of NZ start up) is in court over them selling University of Auckland content (e.g., lectures and tutorial information and insider knowledge, basically of examination content and model answers provided by the second year students that the Univesrity itself chooses to emply).  See, instead of paying people who have completed PhD's who aren't themselves enrolled in undergraduate courses in the area to teach undergraduate courses in the area they pay second year studnets next to nothing.  That means to say tehy give the second year students access to the grading schedule and model answers and the like.  So the second years can pass them onto the first years.  But only if the first years agree to..  I don't know.  I'm sure  you can use your imagination of what people might be inclined to do (anything anything anythign?) to get access to the very best of the date rape drugs and so on.  Since there aren't any actual consultants in the hospital.  Right, Ashley?  
                                </p>

                                <p>One problem is that they pass and give degrees to people who haven't done the work for htem.  But the other part ot the problem is how they won't pass or give degrees to people who have in fact done the work for them.  I mean to say...  A test that is only designed to undermine and stabotage..  To create reason to bomb or eliminate or remove the whole entire enterprise from the face of the earth..  What do you call tlhat?  Lucrative for Chris Hipkins was it?  Only game in town, he was.   Nobody else passed the reading test.  7584547865478574943204930.  That's the answer to number 4 of the reading test byi.  fyi. 
                                </p>

                                <p>Crimson Education went to court at some point.  My understanding was that things were kept private in the name of privacy it is not in the public interest at all, apparently, if University of Auckland Medical Students (for example) are selling or giving test answers or questions to places like Crimson Education or maybe tutors at particular University Residential Halls to pass on to only some of the students so that the ones who get these kinds of services are given better grades or the only passing grades, actually.  I mean to say the people who write the examinations don't get paid by the government, apparently.  THey have to make their living somehow.  They make their living selling the answers to people who will pay them, then.
                                </p>

                                <p>One side to our complete and utter lack of anything approximating an education system (that appears to be what in fact we have decided to do) is how we refuse to graduate people who have met requirements for qualifications who have not cheated.  Where is my credit for the 1 year of research that I did?  Here's a plan...  Don't get my work to external examiners.  Then give my work to someone else to pass off as their own.  My thesis was on disabiltiy and equity in Medicine and Public Health.  Since I wrote my thesis (and credit was not given to me) my thesis was given to various third parties so that various people already on Governmetn payroll could pass it off as their own.  Right?  Do the censorship thing on it and then some or other report on disability came out -- late.  Right?  The Governemnt would only accept it from the government workers on payroll once it had been submitted to them (heavily censored and modified no doubt but derived in fact from my work) -- late.  
                                </p>

                                <p>That seems to me to be precisely why the New Zealand Universities don't really pay the tutors.  So that they are forced to corruption to subsist.  Right?  The prevention and prohibition of development of an Education system.  Right?  That's why they don't pay teh secondary teachers?  So they can take known pedophiles (people who have been taught to be in teh government hospitals and prisons) and place them next to the schools.  That's the pipeline plan.  Right?  Of teh prevention and prohibition of developpmetn system?
                                </p>

                                <p>The online software 'plagarism detectors' software is for the purposes of failing everybody who hasn't submitted something that was plagarised in fact.  Why?  To build an entire army of plagarisers.  Why?  People who will do anything anything anything anything who will be complicit...  Who can be removed at any time.  Right?  That's the plan?  The purpose?  The goal?  The aim?  The point?  People aren't allowed to do anything in NZ that couldnt' be done easier and more cheaply without them.  Enough said.  What is their function?  What is their function, at all?
                                </p>

                                <p>What I am not really sure about is whether the notion that New Zelanders are unskilled and unqualified low value garbage is something that is pushed by the New Zealand Government, or how much it is something that is pushed by other Governments, or how much there is some kind or sort of collusion.
                                </p>

                                <p>I mean to say, it seems to me that the way in which the New Zealand Government goes about doing business is an attempt to get foreign businesses or Governments colluding with them in order to undermine and stabtoage New Zealanders and perhaps even also to trade in the underminig and stabotaging of however many of their own people.  A sort of idea to exhange the low-value hostages and each eliminiate the ones of the other in a way that leaves less of an accountability trail.  Like..  Some idea of staking the people they don't want on enemy terrain so they can be slaughtered by the Russians.  And, I don't know, paying them by the scalps they collect of the Russian soliders who were similarly staked?  I don't know.  Herd the unwanted into a particular region there and bomb the lot of them.  The undesirables from both sides or ends.
                                </p>

                                <p>That is the view of the skilled labor workforce.  Right?  The workers who expect to be paid for the skills and qualifications that the governments sold them.  It sold them this idea that they were to trade or offer to the government to go into a certain amount of debt in exhange for being taught skills and qualifications that there would be jobs for, on their graduation.  The government even chose to set up websites informing people of the salary they could expect on graduation and informing them about their job prospects.  They chose to hire marketers to go about encouraging students to enrol in things because of job prospects they promised them, and the like.
                                </p>

                                <p>And then really rather large sums of money were paid to a few managers to get them turning on each other and eliminating each other and so on and so forth.  To prevent as many of them graduating as possible.  To withhold qualifications.  To not acknowledge the qualifications.  To not hire them into skilled jobs.  To not advertise jobs.  To not employ people to do jobs.  And so on and so forth.
                                </p>

                                <p>Why?  Apparently it has something to do with 3 year elections and so you take everything you can get knowing that it's only temporary.  So you take everything you can get.  And then it's like Kathy whats her name from teh Southern District Health Board...  What was only suppose dto be temporary..  Well..  THey'll need to bomb you to get you to go.  Right?  What did they have to do to Ashley Bloomfield to get him to retire all voluntary-like?  So that they would not need to change the law or uphold the law.  To make it be about people being personally bullied into personally leaving all voluntary?  
                                </p>

                                <p>Quite a few people say things like 'after getting a puppy from a rescue shelter that's the only way I would get a puppy.  They are so forever grateful that you are looking after them properly since they've had it hard, in life'.  I wonder, then, about this idea of slave-trading or slave-traffickign with the idea, then, that you can treat them badly and they won't complain or expect any different, and in fact, those are most desirable.  Right?  I wonder if it was the New Zealand Universities who got the bright idea that they would teach foreign examiners that they expected or wanted them to fail the students only.  Refuse to sign them off.  Refuse to sign off on qualification completion.  THe goal or the aim or the purpose or the point was not respectful exhchange.  The goal or the aim or the purpose or the point of the people on payroll at various universities around the world was to eliminate the students.  Don't sign them off.  Get rid of them.  THe management and administrationa and so on decided that they would take so much money out and teach everyone else to gnaw each others arms off.  ANd it's not just the University of Waikato..  THe AUstralian National University seems to think that that's an admirable or laudable aim or goal as well.  THe administration says that the Philsoophy programme does not have the willingness or ability to supervise graduate research in philosophy.  THey say that they did not get a research proposal from me -- which means they could have chosen a project.  Right?  But they did not have the willingness or ability to supervise is what they said.  More problematic they did not have the willingess or ability to take the thesis that I already wrote for them (it's over on teh writing page) that was supplied to them more than a decade ago..  And get that thesis out to external examiners.  I supplied the thesis to my supervisor and what was his response?  To rattle a tin to fund raise for money to ship me back to New Zealand.  Did he ever get the thesis out to external examiners?  Did he ever make any concrete suggestions for what needed to happen to it before it go out to externals?  Why do they payroll him?  THe preention and prohibition of philosophy programme at the Australian National university.  Australasias leading research institution.  No capacity to employ people willing or able to supervise research.  That's what the university administation wrote was the issue or the problem there.  
                                </p>

                                <p>Apparently there is nothing more to having a university degree than 'I like you in some personal sense or manner or way'.  That's all it means, apparently.  That they chose you.  Because they could equally simply choose not you.  They could choose to just throw your application away.  They could choose not to consider it on it's academic merits.  Apparently they can choose to be racist and sexist and actually they can do anytyhing they like.  Nobody is going to stop them.  The Judiciary says that it isn't a matter of public interest how the Universities just pick and choose whoever they like for whatever arbitrary reasons they like.  It is all very personal.  That means it is not a matter of public interest at all.  That means to say the Judiciary seems to think that if the government sets out to undermine the public interest then it is not the judiciaries job to do anything about that.  Even when teh government is refusing to follow the statutes that they wrote and even when the government is refusing to follow the international conventions and so on that they signed up for.  Apparently everybody just does whatever they want and the biggest bullies get their way.  That's how it is that there isn't any health, education, anything.  Really.  I don't really see anything at all...  Just a bunch of con-municators and marketers and spin-doctors and doctorers of the evidence and so on.  Is this supposed to make it so that people can pat themselves on the back and feel that they made it in life if they get jobs wrongful deathbringing or whatever...  If they are put to work housesitting for free (a sort of domestic slave really) for their academic supervisor because otherwise..  Well, why would they get the work to external exmainers if personal favors aren't done?  I don't know what the other kids had to do to get their sign-off...  But apparently they aren't employed to supervisor or research or, often, to teach philosophy, anyway.  Because there isn't any philsoophy research and there isn't any supervision and there isnt't any teaching where the curriculum isn't set by..  Uh..  Dawkins selfish genes was it?  Or Sterelny's slavery manifesto?  What did the funders choose to fund, then?  What view or message or moral of life did they think was sooooo obvious that it was the only one allowed to be stated?  Nasty bruitish and short.  Sure.  People don't want to live.  Right.  Nothing to see.  Nothing here.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.
                                </p>

                                <p>So...  US Nuke Aircraft landing in Australia.  I wonder what side they are on.  I mean to say, I wonder if there is even anyting in the USA...  Nothing to see in these parts.  Nothing nothing nothing at all...

                                <p>I should probably upload the x ray images that I have of what they did to my legs, at the Waikato hospital.  Where apparently there isn't any radiology.  That's a great idea give people massive doses of x ray radiation when there aren't any radiologists.  And the bang nails and plates and so on into their legs so the bones can't heal straight even if they wanted to.  Make sure they are fused where they are supposed to be mobile and naled crooked.  And then cry cry cry cry cry that we don't have any doctors, we don't have any radiologists cry cry cry cry cry cry that I make a better victim than an abuser and we just don't have enough abusers on payroll..  We have to burn through the burn outs accumulating as many accomplices to the atrocities as we can.  Right?  The lengths we go to..  To throw the applications away...  Throw the applications away...  To throw the applications away..  The next Dr Leeks.  The next Dr Leeks.  The next Dr Leeks.  All heil the great monument to Medicine!  THere was No Alterntive!  Only applicant we acknoweldged.  Only skilled graduate we acknowledged.  There's nobody home.  Nothing here.  Nothing to see..  NOthing nothing nothing at all.

                                <p>I do understand that this was supposed to be a little lesson to me in how I thought I was too good for Philsoophy and so hahahahhahahahahhahaha I end up with nothing serves me right.  There are so very many people in the world other than me, however, and I'm not a selfish f*ck.  But it's soooo much fun to abuse me and it's soooooo competitive and I make good bait, somehow, right?  That's my role or position or job in life.  Right?  I'm good bait.  Right?  That's me.  
                                </p>

                                <p>I didn't think I was too good for Philosophy.  I did not know that various other people had this idea of a hierarchy.  Apparently it was apparent to everybody other than me that Philsoophy was a stupid job for stupids who failed at everything else.  It was also apparently obvious to everyone other than me that New Zealand overall was a stupid country for stupids who were too stupid to make it in Australia which was a stupid country for stupids who were too stupid to make it in the USA.  That's the hierarchy that was there in people's minds.  Apparently I was supposed to have realised or acknoweldged my postion, therefore, as stupid and grovel and suck it up and..  I dno't know...  For how many years was I supposed to housesit for Sterelny and be entertaining at social events and the like before he supervises me (that's entirely at his discretion that's what it means to be on payroll apparently is to not even have regular meetings with your research students)...  Well, he kept Carl for 2x Phd.  Right?  And a hell of a lot of social events.  So...  Apparently they are all trying to be like Kripke.  Apparently he could sexually molest the undergrads and his grads carried him around like human chariots..  Right, right right?  If you don't like it then just turn and walk away..  Just turn and walk away back to your proper place in New Zealand.  Where the problem with the holocaust etc etc was obviously and clearly that there were survivors.  I mean to say that the fact that there were survivors was apparently their big mistake.  If they hadn't have left any witnesses then, well, why, then, I suppose they'd still be at it.  Like they are in Australasia.  Refusing to train a workforce.  Refusing to ackonwledge completion of requirements for training.  Refusing to process applciatins and completions.  Cry cry cry cry cry we don't have any people to work certain jobs and then..  Collecting the rubbish from overseas?  The rubbish that the Northern Hemisphere doesn't want.  THey arrange or organise that if they want any job at all they come and take a job in this part of the world.  Right?  Lured here with promises that they can  be the next Kripke.  Or they can seek and destroy as many undergrads, or grads, or as many people as they can, really.  That's the plan the goal the purpose the point?
                                </p>

                                <p>So how much does the US participate and collude in that only?  I'm trying to think about whether my time in North Carolina..  Well, what to make of it, really.  I actually don't know the norms on leave from work during personal berevement of a close family member (a parent, spouse, or child).  But I do know that I offered to make up for the work that I missed (1 day of grading so that I could morn the day of my Father's funeral when I could not be there in person becuase it was teaching semseter in the USA) and otherwise I met my work obligation to North Carolina.  People sometimes get sick for 1 day.  1 day.  Whatever..  They don't do that anymore.  They don't offer the programme. . I think Geoff travelled out to Australia after that...  I remember seeing him.  I was 'sick' about that time.  Hanging my head.  Because Australia wasn't processing or acknoweldging or progressing my work.  For how long can you keep people doing creative output when you are keeping them, effectively, as slaves.  Simply ignoring the work that they do.  You can see my work on the seminars page and on the writing page and you can see the course they had me teach on the teaching page.  But they werent' acknowledging the seminars or the write ups of them...  You can even see the deterioration in quality over time, hey.  You can see that with my Waikato one, too.  How they f*ck with your head so that your work ends up sounding strangled and angry and like you are talkilng to stupids about stupid becuase they won't have things or allow things to be any other way.  How long can it possibly take to do 3 years of work?  Or 1 year of work?  They had no reason to believe I was intellectually disabled.  Quite the opposite, actually.  They could tell from my transcript (insofar as they were not f*cking playing dumb about it) that I did more than 120 points per year for every year -- up until Waikato gets me enrolled for 2 years and 1 summer school on a MA.  Because Waikato is a partiuclarly stupid university and philosophy at waikato oh my oh my that's as low as you can go down the hierarchy of stupid stupid stupid.  Right? ANd if ever there was a stupid degree for stupid it would be a master of philosophy at waikato (right?).  I mean EVERYBODY knows that NOBODY who completed a PhD in Philospohy from Waikatko gets a job in Philosophy . Unless youa re a pedophile like Alister Gunn in which case MUST HAVE.  Stupid stupid stupid.  Will not have anyting any other way...  The Australian National University informed me that Sterelny was my main supervisor and employed him full time (previously he was part time between ANU and Wellington).  Well that's stupid, hey.  If you want Sterelny to refuse to sign off on your qualificatino you should have stayed in stupid New Zealand.  Australia did not acknoweldge or comment to me on the thesis work that I was doing.  So what am I supposed to do when the people on payroll...  Well, apparently the issue or the situation is that I am meant to be all wide eyes besotted with them follling them around and begging them to pay attention to me.  It' ssupposed to be soooooo competitive between me and the other students and they want to see evidence that you care..  They want to see you being or seeming jealous of the other students for being most favored and so on.  And the emotional or psychological maturity to...  Rise above that?  As best one can..  And be professional.  In such a toxic environment...  Professionalism...  Whatever.  It's soooooo personal.  Just do whatever you want because you want and you want to treat me badly to know how much I care??  Or punish me for not caring??  If you want me to respect you then you only needed to behave admirably.  I don't understand...  Teh ANU has on my student records that my supervisors say that I am progressing.  SO WHY DON"T THEY GET MY F*CKING WORK OUT TO EXTERNAL EXAMINERS AND ALLOW THEM TO EXAMINE IT THEN?  Waikato wants to send it out with a note from my supervisor sayign that my supervisor wants to see it failed.  Riiiiight.  That's what external examination meeeeeeeeans.  It means the slaver get to tell the third party that the slaver thinks that the slave should just keep slaving without pay.  Let's collude in that being how 'universities' are from here on out.  Okay?  That's the Australasian plan for how we can launch into WWIII.  And then there was Covid.  Because as I pointed out in my thesis you don't need Psychiatry to involuntarily detain people in conditions of torture.  You can manufacture other kinds of illness and disease also and political grounds manipulation of things...  And they went GREAT IDEA!!! LETS DO IT!!! Not 'and let's develop psychiatry'.  But 'let's give up the pretence of medicine altogether'.  Stop pretending to graduate people who met the requirements.  Fill up the courses with the children of the Vice Chancellor and so on...

                                <p>Meanwhile...  Apparently Dr Kelly Blincoe is paid $800,000 NOT to do software engineering (to not do software engineering).  There is a good reason not to do software engineering, if I ever did see one...  Do you think NZ will get 200 women graduated from software engineering and employed as software engineers over the next 8 years?  Really?  200 of them?  And then the aim is to track how it is that they drop out.  They will drop out.  Right?  That's the plan..  To write up something something about how you can get them to drop out.  Not be paid to do software engineering anymore else we don't recognise their qualifications.  I guess because they expired 5 years post-graduation.  But then we haven't actually had a graduation since...  Uh...  Urm...  2018?  Is that right?  All our Degrees are honorary degrees only (to be granted or withheld on personal grounds where the decisions have nothing to do with the academic merits and / or when decisions about acaemics merits are all made on personal grounds by people who have a personal stake in whether the student slave remains a slaving...)  I guess the idea is to (1) cry cry cry cry cry cry that we don't have enough software engineers and then (2) scammity scummit scam them into enrolling in a software engineering qualififation where they can do classes on how to set up a gofund me kickstarter nonfungible token scammity scam and then (3) it will be soooooooooooo competitive that they will need to keep paying teh university and paying the university and paying the university.  They can't sign them off as having completed their qualification yet, because they haven't taught them anything that would enable them or able them to get a job.  they better keep paying the university keep paying the university.  It's soooooo competitive.  they better do all this over and above 'volunteer' and 'charity' work.  See, what happens when they just stop your payroll and they don't pay you anymore is that you are forced out of the industry.  you can slavity slave slave slave for the government.  Or fly planes into buildings or something...  Gee i guess the reason why you can't won't help them is the reason they did not teach you anything...  Whatever..  You probably learn to forge your own transcript or hack you bank or whatever anyway.  Right?  yeah right.  Sure.  Course.  computer science...  yawn...  how many computer science grads are there all around the world..  surplus.  surplus.  The problem is that they won't pay tehm.  That's the problem.  They will pay this lady $800,000 to set them up into position where they will not be paid.  She made it in life as a software engineer.  That was the plan, i guess.  Or did she??  Did she make it into the prevention and prohibition of software engineering industry.  Yeah.  Right.
                                </p>

                                <p>My bad -- it is the Waikato Hospital that appears to have the worst IT problems that has meant that they don't have radiology.  If kirsten Young is the person I am thinking (and I could be wrong) she gave a really nice talk about radiology...  I wasn't intending to question her competence in the field.  I just have concerns about the system of training and aknowledgement that training milestones have been completed and registration process. Or, more to the point, the lack, thereof.  Because it's internationally sooooooo competitive that htey are trying to kill off all the skilled workers before they will acknowledge their skills and employ them to do the job for which they have trained.  That appears to be the nature of the competition.  When it's time for the universities to stop collecting money for enrolments and reenrollments and rerereenrollments then it's time for the 'skilled worker' to go away.  Hey.  I do understand that they think it's fine to have a university lecturer teaching a 4/4 course workload assisted by a temporary person who is it's only temporary year after year after year after year and that appears to be conditional upon her not pressing the issue on them acknowleding that she'd done enough for completion of a PhD..  How many decades after she enrolled in that programme?  Anyway...  THe shortage of medical doctors is of course something that is of public intereset.  No.  Nonononononono it's all very personal and particular against me.  I' the only person in NZ affected by the lack of medical doctors and so on and so forth.  Of course.  yeah.  right.
                                </p>

                                <p>The constant personal attacks,  hey.  Apparently it's totally a matter of personal discretion whether they get your work to examiners or whether they allow them to sign off on your qualification.  They just decide on the basis of whatever arbitrary reasons they make up.  They don't have eto make up any reason.  They can make decisions on the basis of their being selfish racist arseholes and that's totally fine.  Because -- let me guess..  I know..  I know the answer to this...  It's an EMERGENCY!!!  Therefore we can do anything anything anything we like with no accountabiltiy whatsoever.  That's why Christchurch was in a state of emergency for so many years..  So the government could roll out a bunch of htings that would never have been approved otherwise.  Ditto Covid.  They never really stop, do they.  We don't have the processes in place for balance of power.  So things always swing.  People would rather have all the power for a short time then be victim to others going mad with power.  We can go mad with power in turns and roundabouts.  That seems to be the idea.  Constant emergency.  Right?  No stability or security.  No point planning.  Can't use the laws to plan since the only thing you can rely on is that the courts will fail to uphold the laws.  What kind of reliability is that???
                                </p>

                                <p>It is good to hear that the Medical Profession is starting use some of the registration funds (I would suppose) to having a tribunal.  Sort things out in house.  But they didn't say what (if any) sanctions were imposed.  I can't imagine they will turn down his registration fees.  Will they?  Will they choose to acknowledge a new graduate and register them, instead?  Maybe he was culled for not doing his job (though I donn't know what if any excuse he has about why his patient was not notified -- and I don't know why the spsecialists report is not sent to the GP and the patient both).  People should not have to rely on the health system to communicate information since they demonstrate they are not competent to do that.  People would (often) be better keepers of their own patient notes.  They have the right to ask (but not apparently for them to be actually changed) if they are in error.  I guess that's the issue.  THey will find out that the hospital and so on has been billing or invoicing insurance companies, I would imagine, ACC, I know, and probably other agencies also..  For things that were unnecessary and perhaps..  Perhaps...  Not even done.  I mean..  What use is radiology imaging without a radiology report?  What use are labs without a pathology report?  Who writes the reports?  Ashley Bloomfield in his spare time?  Maybe Luxon volunteers on Tuesdays?
                                </p>




                                <p>
                                https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/woman-charged-after-baby-found-dead-in-hospital-rubbish-bin-in-south-auckland/EFHYKXNZXRG27ORF4QD34SGKPI/   They couldn't find a better candidate to prosecute.  They had to prosecute that.  Maybe she couldn't properly refresh the webpage the government made on wellbeing that would have enabled her to accept her live baby, or accept that her baby was stillborn...  Or whatever.  Where is the compassion?  Punative punative punative.  We will not help people.  Hey look, there's someone vulnerable to prosecute them.  Ffs.  What the f*ck is wrong with this country?  I guess maybe it's hard to find people who haven't put a dollar in Meredith Connell's pocket, or something (which makes you immune to being prosecuted in the Auckland region, apparently). 
                                </p> 


                                <p>Who remembers (before she was elected) Jacinda Ardern saying that she was not going to have a baby?  Remember that?  She said she objected or protested being asked that question -- because it should not matter what her answer to it is.  But then she chose to answer it, anyway.  And her answer was that she was not going to have a baby and she did not have plans to have a baby if she was elected into office.  You do the math.  Can you do the math?  Did she just outright lie?  That was where I went wrong with my Otago interview.  Right?  They wanted me to be all charasmatic and say anything anything anything because it does not matter at all what you spew out of your mouth.  
                                </p>

                                <p>Pilot safety check-lists before flying is approved.  Right?  Who is in the cock-pit?  What is their registration number.  Who else is in there?  What is their job today?  It's like NZ planes are not allowed to fly.  THey let them fly in (into the USA, into Antartica) but they are not given permission to take-off again.  I guess the thing is that they will not do the pilot safety check-list that is best international practice that has been developed and worked out for international safety and security.  So that, you know, engineers (or whatever) don't need to go and, I don't know, smash some random who would not have been allowed to drive a plane, because he's unncessarily revving his engine (or whatever he was doing).  You could report the behavior to the people who register the pilots and have his lisence suspended.  Right?  Or he wouldn't be allowed to drive or fly a plane.  We just won't do anything properly, hey.  Just do whatever you want to do, people, the laws don't apply to you or to anybody else.  Just f*cking chew each others arms then.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>So, apparently there was some medial tribunal hearing of a general practitioner who failed to inform his patient that the pathology report stated that he have invasive skin cancer.  Good to know that they are putting those medical registration fees to good use, trying to make the profession..  Credible.  Or something.  They didn't say what defence he (or his lawyer) offered.  I was interested in whether he might say 'you never would have hired me to work in New Zealand if I hadn't have agreed to either not refer patients to specialists else not communicate specialists findings to patients'.  I don't know what the outcome of the tribunal was.  I was wondering whether maybe they saw fit to give him a service medal and de-deploy him to Melbourne.  Is that how it goes?  The Medical Profession in New Zealand?  I am trying to remember where I know the name 'Kirsten Young' from...  Was she a Radiology Registrar from Otago?  Does Otago have Radiology Registrars?  Do they have MRIs in the hospital, then?  I wasn't sure that they were paying the IT people to supply the requisite software or computer systems...

                                <p>So...  God of War II is coming out...  Today.  I think.  It's been done before...  God of War.  The franchise.  on Playstation.  I think I read that somewhere.  It was a trilogy.  The latest release of the first one in the franchise was a development for the franchise, though, apparently.  They incorporated a bunch of mythology from Norse gods.  Developed the story and the narrative and so on and so forth in that way.  In those directions.  So, even though people might know 'what happens' in some sense, from having played the trilogy before, the current or present iterationsi a step forward.  Not just  because of frame rate or resolution of graphics display, but in narrative..  Or in..  Arts..  Directions, as well.  Not just a technical or scientific progression kind of a thing.  A development of culture and arts and so on as well.
                                </p>

                                <p>Apparently part of what Star Trek fans really appreciated about Star Trek was not just the techical or scientific or whatever aspects.  Apparently they actually hired or paid linguists to develop Klingon as an actual language.  I mean to say..  The best theories of the time were Chompskian about innate natural grammar and the like.  They paid or invested in linguists to develop klingon as a language that was...  Tot he best of our knowlege at the time..  A language (obeying rules of natural grammar) that was as different as any other known language as possible.  I don't know if they pulled that off..  If they were right or wrong..  But it meant that there were various things about klingon and about Star Trek as the arts that were worth learning about and investing your time in understanding.  Stop NASA!!! STOP!!! We will under-fund you and tell your your under-funding is to be distributed to your artists (in their capacity as second rate or failed scientists) at your discretion (or not).  All heil the hierarchy of being! Calculus first, then organic chemistry?  Is that how it goes?  To be followed by microbiology..  Evolutionary is well down.  That's where the failed scientists go.  Right?  But if they are particularly bad then they do aspects of the arts that are even beneath the 'historical science' aspects of philosophy.  Right?  The great hierarchy of being and value and things worth investing in.  People to be kept slaves etc etc.

People who were trained in voice acting.  Elocution lessons.  Speaking.  Articulating clearly.  What have you...  They tried...  THey were paid to...  They tried...  TO develop a *dialect*.  A *local accent* for that game.  I think.  I could be put right..  But I think that was the idea.  They tried to develop a *regional accent* for the English that was spoken.  IN that game.  That was work for the arts.  For people interested in accent and linguistics and acting and elocution.  And they were granted funding and a certain amount of freedom and automy to get on with their f*cking job and do that...  And other people wrote the script.  Scriptwriters.  And other people did the coding.  Computer sciene people.  Did the coding and so on.  ANd New Zealand seems to miraculously fail at absolutely f*cking everything that it *tries* to do.

                                <p>$100,000 grant to study New Zealandia...  Is that 2 post-doctoral fellowships over 1 year, or something else?  You want to write a book and are looking for collaborators..  Did you know that nobody in Greece is allowed to do earth science on the biological history of the Greece without half of your funding (your funding) going to people who work on the beliefs of of the people about the gods and so on?  That's how academia works in Greece and most other parts and places of the earth, of course.  They pick out a certain special group of people whose only contribution is allowed to be the arts contribution.  So, then, if NZ is a country on a plate..  There isn't a fault line running up the length of the country?  So the earth-shaking isn't fault lines moving or shifting against each other, then?  It's due to..  Well, something something about fraking..  And so on...  I don't know.  I'm not particularly interested.  Google Earth makes much of Antartica look like a collage of microbiology slides.  All unlabelled, of course, so no idea what you are seeing.  Parts of muscle tissue and lipid molecules and what have you...  We want our scientists to be assembly line workers.  Ford assembly line science.  Yeah.  They don't want people seeing the big picture.  I mean golly gee they might start wanting to use the big picture to do something like, oh, I don't know, make the world a better place for all of the people presently existing and into the future.  Well, we wouldn't want that now, of course.  Too busy ruining things for everybody.  So...  Greenland.  Okay.  The other polar cap.  I need to have a bit of a think about the rotations that go into day/night and times of the year and polar caps...  Maths is so much easier when it is provided in the context of sometihng meaningful.  Wouldn't you say?  You actually see the use of doing the various calculations.  But it's okay.  Chris Hipkins Studied Criminology at Victoria so he would be expected to know about how the Education system can be used to populate the prisons.  He would know all about the pipeline, there, I would suppose. Is how you go from being a Ministry Official to being a Democratically Elected Representative of the People.  Of course.

Did he apply for a job at MacDonalds?  They chose to hire him, did they?  Because he was most qualfied to work there, was he?  They chose to hire him rather than a younger person who they could pay less money to?  Oh, that was why he chose to work for them for free.  Did he have to give them 2 weeks notice to leave?  Is that how it works?  Or can you just quit a job out of the blue and walk off.  Is that how it works?  I don't know...  He wasn't stuck working it for another couple weeks so they could arrange to do new interviews and so on and hire someoen else to fill the position?  No?  We don't appear to have a functioning economy.  Hey.  A what, now?  Why would we have functioning financial sector when tehre's no fucntioniing health sector or education sector..  Oh my..  Nothing nothing nothing at all...  It's not about the money.  It's about choosing to keep people in condtions of torture and deprivation and abuse.  Choosing to force people to comply with your decisions where your decisions are about undermining them because of your own selfishnes..  One can only suppose.  All eyes on me!  All eyes on me!!  All eyes on me!!!  Strange how nobody wants to give New Zealand fifteen million to set up, I don't know, rocket lab and then demand to be paid thirty million or else...  Nobody thinks that that is even worth doing here.  That's how little the value of New Zealand...  Not worth anything.  Hey.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.
                                </p>

                                <p>Why was Jacinda Arderns husband with her, in Antartica?  Is that normal?  Is it normal for people to take their husbands and babies with them to work?  Who pays for him?  Who pays for his accommodation and his flights, and so on?  Was he democratically elected, then?
                                </p>

                                <p>So, I don't know about this, but I've been thinking...  I guess I always thought (insofar as I thought about such things) that there was a North Pole, and there was a South Pole.  By which I mean to say, there was a North Polar Region and the South Polar Region.  By which I mean to say, if you started up in the North Pole and you travelled around the globe then you would end up back in the North Pole because you travelled around the globe in a circle, right.  So, could you pass through the South Pole on your way out and away from the North Pole before you get back to the North Pole, or are they the same region?
                                </p>

                                <p>I guess it's from the olden day globes that people had that had a pivot point through an axis and it rotated around...  The equator.  You could rotate the globe around so that you moved (in relation to it) in a circle about the equator.  And there was a polar region up top and another polar region down the bottom.  But I never did see a globe that was aligned on the other axis so that you could rotate it and see if there were two or only one polar region.
                                </p>

                                <p>What difference does it make?  I mean...  Aside from people who may live there or people trying to claim various bits of it...  I think it may change the map considerably when it comes to shortest distance between two points.   Between the USA and Russia, say.  Or between the USA and NZ or England and NZ or Russia and NZ or whatever.  I don't know how cold it gets in the Arctic or what difference that makes to flights.  I don't know about air currents and what if any impact they have.  Things like that.  But I suppose it makes it clearer how NZ is a detention camp for the world.  On the world stage or whatever.  It's where the nuclear fallout goes.  I'm pretty sure about that.  Some things don't make much sense to me...
                                </p>

                                <p>There was stuff about white people being white because they came from regions far from the equator where there was less light.  So, people tended to have darker skins by the equator which was allegedly or apparently to protect their skin from the harmful effects of radiation.  But that didn't make much sense to me since Maaori and Pacific had higher rates of skin cancer and deaths from than the white people did, in NZ, I thought.  And New Zealand has really really really really high rates of what Pathoma says is 'easily preventable' skin cancers.  And, so, how does that happen 'in the wild', so to speak, with us being so far from the equator?  And with darker skin being protective against radiation such that you would expect Maaori to have less harmful skin cancer?  It doesn't quite add up,  huh.
                                </p>

                                <p>Apparently it is becuase we are closer to the hole in the ozone layer.  Which was located by the South Pole.  Not the North Pole.  The South Pole.  Hey.  Yes, pretty sure that's how the story goes.  So the atmosphere is particularly toxic.  That was the posit to explain why New Zealanders have higher rates of skin cancer.  It relied on there being two arctic regions.  I think.  I don't know.  I guess looking at Google Earth would tell me. 
                                </p>

                                <p>Looking at Google Earth is strange...  I think about what looking at my blind spot looks like.  I mean to say, you don't usually or normally notice that you have a blind spot.  I am certain that there are many blind spots all over Google Earth.  I wonder what they look like...  How I would know that I'd found one...  I wonder, sometimes, whether the earth has been fully explored...  Or not...  Whether there may be people...  Or what...
                                </p>

                                <p>I had to write to my bank to request a charge back from two internet purchases that I made.  One of the sites is down for 'stocktake' apparently, but the item has not arrived and I can't see any way for me to contact them.  The other site is mostly down (but they are still selling items online so far as I can see -- but now at very low prices which indicates to me that they are more overtly a scam).  I asked for the charge backs and provided a link for them to Consumer Magazine.  Seems that since Mastercard issues a Mastercard to them it is about the bank notifying Mastercard.  Hopefully promptly so that something can be done to prevent more people from being scammed, or whatever.  You know, the NZ bank doing it's job or playing it's role or it's part in responding promptly to problems.  Right?  I also asked to speak with a financial advisor.  A qualified one for proper financial advice.  For them to tell me what (if any) charge is associated with that service.  Of my speaking with and potentially getting financial advice from a qualified person qualified to give advice.  I think that our banks have duties to their customers to ensure that they have protections from other people (or from the New Zealand Government) financially abusing them or whatever.  Right?  You would think.  Right?  I mean...  Do we have a functioning financial sector, at all?  Up to them, really.  My phone has been going off the hook but yakkity yakkity yak yak yak write it down.  Make it nice and easy for the international agencies to see what occurred or transpired in writing.  Write it down.  Write it down.  Write it down.  Your considered opinion.  Write it down for the world, please.
                                </p>

                                <p>It probably doesn't change the distance much.  I don't know.  I don't know anything about naval navigation or ocean currents or what have you.  But I do know that the only message that white people want to hear out of Maaori mouths is that it is an essential part of what Maaori believe that they had a deep understanding of navigation using the stars that allowed or enabled them to navigate to New Zealand.  But I don't know what kind of sails they had on their boats to harness the power of wind to move against currents...  They rowed their way here?  I don't think we have a cross-Tasman rowing competition...  I don't think that's plausible?  Maybe I am wrong..  I don't know...  It is supposed to justify..  Why..  Maaori people won't let Maaori people learn science.  That's the story.  Right?  Maaori people are hierarchical and selfish such that the kid of the tribal chief leader gets to...  Uh...  Learn science?  Or whether they get to do things without having learned any science.  Or whatever.  I don't know.
                                </p>

                                <p>The 'do not travel' warning applied to government workers, I thought.  During their government work.  What citizens did in their personal lives was not so restricted by the government.  Except that this is New Zealand.  Most government 'work' is performed (insofar as we can call it that) by 'volunteers'.  I suppose that Baxter was not being paid when they staked him to a cross, or similar, on enemy terrain in the hope that the enemy would kill him.  Was  he paid for his time in compulsory military service?  Or was he a volunteer?  It seems that the world is collecting evidence (sending out calling cards, if you will) as to how much the New Zealand Government values it's people.  Little things..  Seeing whether the New Zealand Government actually bothers to inquire via appropriate channels as to their whereabouts when they have gone missing.  Whether they even ask if they are okay or if there is anything that can be done at this end to help assist with their return.  Maybe put them on an Air NZ plane, even?  Or do we treat out people like disposable rubbish -- and expect the rest of the world to do the same?
                                </p>

                                <p>Bones is another...  Something something about Strontium.  Replacing Calcium.  Was it?  Something like that.  In teeth as well.  So they can tell from analysing the bone in your tooth what part of the world you grew up in.  Sort of.  Because of things that are deposited in your teeth and in your bones.  I wonder if that's how the people are being poisoned in NZ, as well.   I mean, how do kids up north get rickets?  It's quite the mystery, hey.  THey can't be sun-deprived (before Covid) and lack of milk is not usually a problem in New Zealand.  Right?  How does that happen?  I know they were fairly interested (globally) in how keeping people (particularly old people in state care institutions) and sick people..  In hospitals and 'hospitals' and the like..  Keeping them indoors behind glass with no natural light..  In prisons and the like without access to exercise yards outdoors..  How that would do things like..  Delay wound healing.  The bones would become fragile and start to crumble.  Frailty.  'Don't fall down!' says the Otago District Health Board.  I think all around the world they were interested in doing the DEXA scans or whatever they are called, after certain people (particularly young fit healthy people), were forced to stay behind glass during Covid lockdown and quarantine restriction etc.  Partiuclarly when people were stuck in the high-rises, yeah.  Without balconies.  No natural sunlight.  The effect of that on bone density and so on.  How to kill people faster.  Like we don't know.  Like that's not hte aim the goal the purpose or the point.  Right?  I mean...  What are we supposed to think or believe..  The lengths they go to to throw away my application to Medicine...  The lengths they go to to keep the likes of Dr Leeks and so on and so forth in.  The fact that the VC of Queensland (on his salary) chose to cheat his daughter a place and the state or federal governmetn did not prosecute him and did not make her earn a place on her merits if she was to have a place at all.  Advertising to the world that *there is nobody home*

<h3>29 October 2022</h3>

<p>Sorry.....  Sorry.... YOu have used up your 'lifetime entitlement' aka your 'entitlement to life' your life is done, now.  Over.  Done-sies.  You have outlived your usefulness to us.  We did our careful candiate selection process and once we mopped up the very best of the best of the  best for Dr Leeks 2.0 and so on and so forth there simply weren't any places left in Medicine or Psychology or Education (counselling) or anything, anything, anything at all.  By the time the pedophiles and the pedophile wannabees and the pedophile aplogestics and apologists rocked up and rolled up and said 'hey!!  we will work that 'job' for free' there wasn't anything left.  Nothign.  Nada.  Nothign to see.  Who wants  a trip to the NZ 'dependency' that is some or other of an antartcic region?  Know what you will see?  Plasic bottles and shit like that for days.  That's why the international community was willing to say 'sure, New Zealand, claim that as your dependency.  You are totally so first world, now, cutting edge of the science legitimacy programme anybody who Winston wants to say fille up all the 'science expedition places' so that nobody can see all the f*cking shit.  All the f*cking shit.  Nobody here nothing home.  Land of hte f*cking idots.  You can have it.  it's yours Nieve or whatever your name is.  The cultural legacy you interpreted from your sh*t for brains mother.  Yeah, right.  I'm sure she does what she's told.  Heil Hitler and all that.
    </p>

<p>Huuuuurr....  Hmmmmm....  So, I tried to purchase Persona 5 on Switch at the High Street (Aucklaknd Central) store for EB Games (Basically the dedicated Games Store for Australasia).  But no can do.  They can do NewMarket...  But not central.  I was also interesed in how it was censored...  They aren't quite sure...  I would imagine that it's something something something about 'normal sexual behavior in your region' and they can't really (credibly) give Persona 5 anything less than a 13 years.  Right?  What's the age of puberty?  What's the age of sexual consent?  C'mon...  Anyway...  So now Fallout 4 (which I am also interested in for various reasons) is getting an R 18.  Why?  Because 'you are S.P.E.C.I.A.L' but you can't hear that until you are R18...  Riiiiight.  Being 'special' has a different meaning in these parts, prior to the age of...  Consent?  What's that now???  Yeah, right....
    </p>

<p>When I said about 'tell CohhCarnage to cut his hair, or else...  People will think that he is *trying* to look like matt Mercer...'  I understand there is a...  Rivalry?  A...  Disconnect.  It happens, sometimes.  Personality clash (through no fault of your own).  Kind of a, or sort of a, situation.  There isn't enough room in the world for the both of you?  I don't quite know what to say...  But the idea was...  I was intentionally thinking of 'Community'.  Troy is asking about whether it is weak for him to continue to wear his High School Letter Jacket in Tertiary Education or whether it is weak for him to stop wearing it because people mocked him for wearing his High School Letter Jacket in Tertiary Education.  And he is told (righly enough) that what is weak...  Is not whatever it is that he decides (whether he wears it or not) but the *reasons* that go into his deciding.  That is to say, he would be weak to succumb to popular opinion.  He would be weak to make the decision on the basis of what he thinks (whether rightly or wrongly) the people would think of him...  I mean to say...  How CohhCarnage chooses to wear his hair is up to him.. And if the people think he is *trying* to look like Matt Mercer, or the dwarf from 'Game of Thrones' is besides the point...  It's a personal decision for him to make.  And there will be lovers and haters for both the right and wrong reasons so you do you, at the end of the day, when it comes to how you choose your hair...  FFs.  He is big enough (ugly enough, rich enough) to make his own decisions.  Relatively impervious to what I (mere one child) have to say about that.  I was kidding, was all I meant to convey with that.  
</p>
<p>Aaarrdkfhdoilhekghrdkl.  So, there is more to be said (and more will  be said) about my....  Disappointment?  DISAPPOINTMENT>>>  uh...  Whatever... With the 'Borderlands' Franchise...  The way in which they went about phyiscal Switch Game Cartridge Sales.  False advertising.  Defective product.  Indeed.  I'd reference that -- but I don't want to get anybody into trouble for having said...  It was not what it advertised as being...  A legendary collection of 3 games.  When in fact..  One, basically, trial. Of the first part of one of the games only was on the game cartridge.  The rest of it was all about online or e access only.  Not for resale etc etc.  An electronic product (with no indicator that that was what it was and no indication of for how long it would be providing online access only).  It is a difficult thing for the gaming industry...  People who will go over and above and beyond..  And increasingly, increasingly, only more and more vultures willing to exploit...  
    </p>

    <p>Anyway...  Point being that the way they approached selling the game on Nintendo Switch Game Catridge put me off the franchise entirely.  I didn't play Tiny Tina's.  Maybe it's great.  I just think that Australia 2K Games is not credible.  Because of the way they chose to sell their Switch Cartridge.  Compare that with BioShock (vast amounts of download required also not particularly cool).  Compare that with the tiny Polish Studio that put the whole Witcher 3 on Cartridge.  And they over-promised for whatever game I haven't played yet...  CyberPunk.  In part because they were egged on (officiallly or not) by people like...  Rockstar..  The whole of the LA Transport simulator people behind them or whatever to develop the transport simulator that they did..  That took them how many years?  So they get the CyberPunk people to under-estimate the amount of development time that it takes to simulate realistic driving and avoidance behavior in ways in which people have come to expect...  For the... What?  Stabotage of the gaming industry??  YOU GO CALIFORNIA!!!!  YOU GO NOW!!!  TIny little gaming studio from Poland made the Witcher 3 available on a single game cartridge. Meanwhile...  Australia was...  Uh...  Yeah, so about the Borderlands...  Lost interest.  Wonder why????  Quid Pro Quo Clarisse...  One can only hope...
    </p>

<p>He is in the unenviable position of.. It comes out occasionally...  Three kids to put through...  Private schools, was it?
    </p>

    <p>And back to your regularly scheduled programming...
    </p>

<p>And, of course, I'm not stupid enough to not realise that I'm doing exactly what it is that they want me to do.  Philosophy research or work (lecturing, on a daily basis, effectively, for no pay).  Where's the money?  Where's the money?  Where's the money?  Where's the money for all the work I do?  Where's the money for all the filings I have done for the courts?  The Government chooses to hire major firms (Bell Gully, Thompkins Wake etc etc) and Queens Councillers to do their filings.  The Government chooses to payroll the 'private firms' to be 'independent' from the Government...  How much money the entitled little brats of various people are paid to prance about in their suits...  While sending me bills and invoices and bills to pay them I should pay them I must pay them I must  pay them I must pay.  I must bankroll their selfish genes towards the extermination of us all I must pay I must pay I must pay I must pay.  The Government refuses to say (answer Official Information Act Request for Information) how much money the University of Auckland and Waikato and Otago and New Zealand Vice Chancellors Committee (Trading as 'Universities New Zealand') pays their lawyers and firms for colluding with the courts to say that I must pay I must pay I must pay and they won't tell the government how much taxpayers money they hemmorrhage to their own selfish genes at the expense of everybody else.  It's too f*cking costly to be born in Australasia.  Too f*cking costly.  There's nothing here.  Nobody home.  
</p>

<p>I did not see any New Zealand magazine 'jobs for Philosophers'.  Apparently they withhold my PhD and other graduate research qualifications because they will never pay me.   No point them giving me a Degree because they will never pay me.  Why would they pay me?  They get the work out of me for free.  Right?  Or I can just up and die, then.  What do they care?  What do they care about me?
    </p>

    <p>Don't worry -- Italy can fly the New Zealand Officials around...  Couldn't arrange a boat to Antartica.  Why nobody recognises that New Zealand has a land claim, there.  How much money were people paying Winston Peters to get to be on the boat to Antarticaa?  We don't have any corruption.  We don't recognise when Italy signs off on Medical students having completed their internship requirements.  Nobody home.  Nothing here.  Nothing to see.
    </p>

    <p>Apparently I owe the New Zealand Governmetn more than $100,000 for qualifications that New Zealand refuses to acknowledge.  There aren't any jobs for Philosophers.  None.  Of course there are actually various people on payroll to do that -- But I'm 'not eligible to apply' since they refused to get my PhD to externals in order to prevent and prohibit my being signed off as having completed the requirements for that Degree.
    </p>

    <p>Never was there any better or greater reason to believe in the death instinct than those people who chose to expediate their own selfish progeny for their own selfish reasons.  What's that?  You were manipulated..  Oh.  What a shame you didn't have anybody independent who you could talk to to help you figure out or navigate a way through.  Hey, I know, why don't you just blather it all over the internet?  Or what...  Just curl up and f*cking die, then.
    </p>

    <p>WHERE IS MY F*CKING MONEY? SHOW ME THE MONEY???????  WHERE IS THE MONEY?????  WHERE IS MY MONEY??????  Down down down goes the sinking f*cking ship.  Nuke NZ and, there aren't any people in Antartica -- right?  Terra Nulla.

<h3>28 October 2022</h3>

<p>Ah Dawkins.  I suppose some of Sterelny's earlier work was Dawkins vs Gould.  Then something something about him dressing like an ape when invited to Oxford, or whatever.  Dawkins...  Writer of 'the God delusion'.  I think Sterelny said something about him being involved in a custody dispute with his ex-wife, who was religious, and he was trying to discredit her as a Mother.  That's what he said to me, anyway.  Rather pointedly, I suppose.  The function of diagnosis of delusion.  I suppose that was the idea.
</p>

<p>
So now we are talking about the function of calling something a 'myth', I suppose.  Quine said 'to call a posit a posit is not to patronise it'.  'Patronise' has a double-meaning.  We have Patron Saints of various things.  Well, the Catholics do.  We have Patrons of the arts.  Or, at least, we used to.  There is also 'Patronise' which I suppose has something to do with entertaining or delighting the chortle chortle snort  brigade who happen to be your funders.  Those old Medical shows showed people like Dr House, or whoever, who were not good at the whole being pleasant to your patrons thing.  Something something about not suffering fools glady.  And there is the 'patronise' as in speaking or talking down to.  People like to patronise children.  Oh yes, they do.  Depending on the  balance of power, I suppose.  Artists are more or less required to speak or write in code.  So that their funders continue to patronise them, or they patronise their funders, or however it goes.  So, to call a posit (let us consider that p) a posit (it is a posited entity or thing, a hypothetical, an abstracta, something along those lines) is not to patronise (belittle, discredit(?), scorn) it.  Perhaps that is the idea.  To call a Maaori contribution to knowledge part of arts of culture or myth or legend or something along those lines is not to heap scorn upon it.  But it is difficult, sometimes, when things are confounded, so.
</p>

<p>I think the only message that white people want to hear out of Maaori people's mouthes (the only one they are allowed to speak) is that Maaori navigated to New Zealand using 'Maaori science'.  Why?  Because of the importance, in white people mythology (I suppose) about Captain Cook and Australia not having any people insofar as he could see (terra nullus) and being shot down off the coast of Rhode Island.  The import that people give to being 'first off the boat' (rather than 'fresh off the boat').  The exhibitions in the Otago museum.  The ships of the white people compared to the indigenous carved log.  I think that the message is pretty...  The obvious is obvious...  Indigenous people likely navigated here by following the wind currents.  That's how the nuclear waste floats here (and our government does nothing to get the people cancer care when we suffer the effects of other nations decisions to nuclear various things -- instead our government goes meeeeeee tooooooo and gets to work irradiating people for scans and the like when there is no intention to get radiology reports or use information from the scans for treatment purposes)...  The way the worlds plastics tend to float themselves to Dunedin.
</p>

<p>That isn't to patronise or undermine it.  There are stories of courage that can be told.  I thought it was part of Maaori legend about Maui fishing up Aotearoa.  It is part of what some white people believe that God created the world in 6 days.  It is part of Hinduism that there are many Gods.  It was part of the Greek system of beliefs that Gods used to walk amongst men.  Maaori belief system reminds me (in ways) more of the Greek system of Gods.
</p>

<p>If you study religion or religions or faiths of the world...  Belief systems...  World views.  Gestalts.  Whatever...  You can start to find or see or notice underlying themes or commonalities...  There is a guy in Bioethics at Otago (at least there used to be) who gave his Professor Lecture about 'Our Common Humanity'.  It was about how people are people are people and you can identify and see people across all the differences.  Of course Peter Crampton was rolling his eyes 'where is the money you are supposed to bring me and the University' because he doesn't understand.  That's why Peter Crampton got to throw away applications to Medicine because he was looking for his money that he believed he was entitled to.  He did not understand about common humanity.  I guess because he was the one with the majority of the power.  Since his parents brought him here, fresh off the boat, when he was 12 or 14 to take up his rightful place as head of Maaori Medicine, or similar, at Otago.  Last I heard of him he was involved in hiring (or not) people to work as Doctors in the Dunedin Hospital.  I guess it is difficult to find people (or something) willing to work with or under or for the likes of Dr Leeks and the junior doctor who killed Amber Heard.  Difficult to find people willing to..  Patronise them?  Is that how we say? 
</p>

<p>So Dawkins is a bit of a problem.  With his having published 'The God delusion' where he seemed to be intending or meaning to patronise (as in chastise, undermine, discredit) religion and religious beliefs.  Why?  Because of his world-view, his gestalt, his faith in 'The Selfish Gene'.  So we know or understand something of the system of beliefs that he is choosing to serve.  Good to know,  hey.  Have I read 'the God Delusion'?  Not recently.  I'm not particularly or overly interested in his system of beliefs.  What interest has he shown in the Maaori world-view.  I see why people may choose not to patronise him.  How many examinations do the Cambridge Curriculum people get from Maaori?  HOw many do they choose to give good grades to and scholarships to?  Given how they choose to expediate their own children at the expense of everybody else.  Patronise them?  Something like that...  
</p>

<p>Apparently the College of Australasian Emergency Medicine is sending out a message that they are censored.  Not sure by whom or what.  By themselves, I would imagine, or suppose.  By the people who decide or choose who to register or accept as part of that system.  I would imagine or suppose that if people who are registered or accepted as part of that system had something to say then they would speak it in-house.  And that would be considered and thought about and so on.  And then a message thought to be representative would come out.  To prevent people going renegade and undermining the whole thing because of some personal...  I don't know.  Some selfish gene ideology, perhaps.  
</p>

<p>For how many years am I supposed to give people the opportunity to sort it out in-house?  Taking the piss, somebody is.  
</p>

<p>Taking all the money out.

<p>I don't know that we have Emergency doctors, in New Zealand.  I mean to say, we don't have Emergency Departments.  They would need AT LEAST 3 Emergency consultants for a functioning Emergency Department.  That means to say 1 in the hospital, 1 on call for a consult, 1 is not available.  They are sleeping or playing golf or computer games or spending time with family or the gym or whatever it is that they need to do so that they can recover and relax and come back to work willing and able to do the job for which they are paid.  New Zealand does not have hospitals.  I think I read around the time of the White Island incident that there was someone (maybe a Registrar?) in Emergency Medicine...  Maybe the only consultant in Emergency Medicine in the hospital??  Who said she never saw so many Cardiac Surgeons all in one place (e.g., consulting with each other) as she did when vulnerable tourists started being wheeled in the door...  I mean to say I think she was expressing that she lost control of the Emergency Department as everyone and their dog rushed in there to 'get in there and have a go' and helping me helping me helping me help myself to you, my precious...  You get the idea.  
</p>

<p>I hear the Maaori voice that they are most often excluded from science.  They will say that they don't have the money to have chemistry laboratories in the schools but science does not require expensive equipment.  That's just a bullsh*t made up excuse.  Maaori are also excluded from everything else, including the arts, however.  That's right.  No Shakespeare for Maaori.  Maaori can play the Moor only.  I think that white people don't understand what role they are supposed to play when...  Confronted...  ?  With the Haka.  So they feel it is a bit of a 'quid pro quo'.  That's the message that they have wanted to convey, as well, I suppose.  Maaori are a warlike people so we must keep them impoverished and deprived for our own safety.  That's why the leader of Australia chooses to find the largest African American he can find to present himself as tiny as he can in comparison...  To, allegedly, motivate and inspire the white people of Australia to be appropriately afraid or fearful of giving the Aboriginal people any kind of voice or say because they are afraid of being taken over.  Why they kept the African American people in chains for so many years.  Because they were afraid of what would happen if they realised their power or the power they had.  The white people were afraid.  Anyway...  I saw this documentary (on netflix) about that Australian AFL player.  How they got the blonde haired blue eyed sports announcer to say that calling out insults to players (including the 'n word') wasn't anything that he wouldn't have said or anything that many people in Australia wouldn't have said...  Of course nobody who is Aboriginal would be capable of being a sports announcer.  Oh, my.  The sense of..  Entitlement.
</p>

<p>Are New Zealand citizens entitlted to travel?  I think we are...  Aren't we?  If the country we want to travel to accepts our passport and allows us to enter in...  Then I think we are permitted to travel there...  Entitled to move around freely?  Or we are not entitled to do anything that the Government suggests we don't do.  It wasn't prohibited for New Zealand citizens to travel to Iran, was it?  It was not reccommended...  But it was permitted.  I think the 'not reccommended' applies to government workers.  That is or means to say, that Jacinda and government employees (including academics) are not permitted to travel there as it isn't reccommended.  They would need to have their travel plans approved...  That means to say the travel plans would be more scrutinised and may be declined?  Is that what it means?  I think it is something like that...  When the governmetn says that travel to a place is not reccommended.  It is a way of informing citizens to take extra care.  Or something.  I would suppose...
</p>

<p>I don't know anything about the details...  But..  Social Media people.  Journalists.  Really, I suppose.  That's something Journalists do.  Travel to places.  Meet with people.  Listen to what they say.  Because people want to know what is really going on...  So people travel and write about their experiences.  And you read about those and come to learn.  Like reading Christy Brown's 'My Left Foot' when I was in High School got me thinking about the potential of the human foot and the mobility and fine motor control to be found in feet...  Which is much underappreciated in the whole 'we are descendents of apes who used their feet for climbing and gripping and grasping but the human foot has lost that capacity or potential' mentality that you get in modern medicine and orthopedics and rehabilitative medicine and physiatry and so on. Anyway...  That's why the guy isn't allowed the braille machine he has identified in being most helpful to him.  The government could give him arts scholarship funding to write his story but they are more fearful of what he would say, I suppose.  So they treat him badly which makes it more likely he can only write about their crimes and so on and so forth.  Their own worst fears materialised from their own worst fears.  The people with power...</p>

<p>
Anyway...  The government shows they still don't know what 'entitled' means and what 'sense of entitltement' means.  People are saying...  ABout the 'old boys' who take from the public for their own private advantage...  And the government does not hear of that as 'entitled'.  Does not think that it is a matter of public interest how people are selected into training programmes, who is allowed to graduate from them and so on.  Not in the public interest.  Indeed, it is not.  Selfish selfish genes all the way undermining everything.  Locusts decimating..  They love their children, do they?  My precious...  I wonder what the Queensland VC's daughter really wanted.  I mean, she did not want to earn entry to Medicine on her merits.  What did she want?  did she want to do medicine or was that her father?  What did she want?  She wasn't prepared to work for it?  He wouldn't allow it?  He wouldn't hire her quality tutors?  I don't understand...
</p>

<p>
Hostages...
</p>

<p>I think the message to me in the courtroom was that I was somehow responsible for not bringing a MacKenzie friend, to court.  That since I did not bring a room full of people wanting to upload the proceedings to social media justice was not for me.  Was that the idea?  
</p>

<p>It is not safe for people to get close to me, in New Zealand.  Obviously and clearly.  That's part of the stragey for isolating me and shutting me down.   I mean, suppose that I wanted to have a boyfriend.  What would happen?  If my boyfriend was working then he would be expected (the government would say) to support me.  Financially.  The Governmetn would say that he, effectively, owned me now.  Right?  Was financially responsible for me.  Entirely.  I couldn't leave him then, right?  No matter what he did to me.  Right?  Or what...  Women's shelter could get money for keeping me, then.  Maybe an ambulance officer volunteer can find me or take me out and present me to the 'emergency department' and they can immobilise me and pop me in a hospital bed and get how much per night for keeping me?  Is that the idea/l?  That's the plan?
</p>

<p>
I do have some family, in New Zealand.  They are working class people with working class, government jobs.  It is not safe for me to get or be close to them, either.  I would imagine or suppose that they would be pressured in various ways to shut me down.  I believe that there may be conflicts, also, in things that they might say...  If they make comments about how things are in the police or in the private or the public hospitals or in the law offices of New Zealand or in food supply chains..  I intentionally don't ask for specifics or details from them and they are not responsible for any of the things that I have said when I speak out...  I don't spend much time with family because I think that the Goverment uses personal relationships to shut people down.  Control them and the like.
</p>

<p>It is obviously and clearly not safe for me to have a partner or a kid...  I mean to say..  Suppose I did have a kid.  Then what?  I remember someone I knew in Canberra saying about how she had these ideas about how she was going to raise her kid.  Her kid was not going to have a barbie doll, in particular.  Stuff like that.  She said, though, that your kid has to go to school, though, right?  So then your kid comes home with their own ideas.  That her kid came home saying she wanted a barbie doll.  The kid noticed mummy cringing and not wanting her to have one.  So kid hunkers down and wants one even more.  Of course.  That's what kids do.  In figuring out what aspects or parts of their parents they also are and what they aren't.  They find the things that make you cringe or whatever and they play with them for a while.  What did darling daughter want to do?  Destined for medicine?  Did she want to go to broadway and do musical?  Anyway...  If I had a kid, in NZ you can bet that that would be used against me only.
</p>

<p>New Zealand is a very toxic environment.  Selfish gene.  Hierarchical. It's soooooooooo competitive.  Everybody is either top dog or someone else's  b*tch.  Right?  Nobody wants me to succeed or have things I want because that undermines them, in some way.  Right?  Every time I learn something new something is taken away from someone else.  
 </p>

 <p>But people have the internet and so on, now.  So that it is possible for people to get their social needs met away from or outside their local community.  So, the government can work to make and keep communites toxic and deprived and all that,  but they can find...  Resonance...  Complement...  Overseas.  Cohh says that Breath of the Wild is 'empty'.  I think he's missing a Korok seed...  If they get to one then it's like playing whack a mole...  The other voices speak up...  Democratisation of the internet.  I get that they are trying to keep the Twits in line on Farcebook...  Thinking of their College Applications.  Richard Faull (takes the Fall ahahahhaha) can measure the circumfrence of all the Rugby Girls heads and they can see how many applications to play Women's Rugby Cornell and the other Ivy League schools get from Maaori from New Zealand next year...  So that the entitlted sons of the rich listers in the US can do anything anything anything, I suppose.  I suppose that's the idea/l of how there's nothing to work for here, there, or anywhere.  Right?  But, you know, people get sick and there is no shorage of entitled children to Kickstart or GoFundMe get a ransom paid.  Right?  The world that they made.  The only one they will invest in...

    <p>It is probably important that the national zeitgist about mothers includes gems like:  https://www.nzfilm.co.nz/films/braindead  She was a 'little strict'...
    </p>

    <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXVz9N3xqxE  New Zealand takes it's physicist (who complained about the first year medical student wannabees at the ripe old age of 18 cheating on their assessments to gain entry to second year medicine) and re-deploys him to work on R values for epidemology...  Belaboring them for the benefit of the NZ government, I suppose...  Making up mathematical models to justify decisions that the government made about lockdown on quite independent grounds...  Michel Baker has a twin??  In Sydney? Someone other than himself who earns a different payroll over there????  Meanwhile the Canadians teach the children of New Zealand about Rocket Lab (or something)...</p>

    <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RwZ7gSAEus  Take over!!! Time to shut it down!!!!</p>

    <p>Question by Random Dude in Court-Room 'does anyone actually support you, in this?'  Me in response.  Mmmkdhhisdgirygiorghidfkghfklg uh...  'How's your mother?  Tell her I said 'hello''.  Where did I get that expression?  Cohh Carnage.  He says that.  What does it mean?  I don't know.  I don't know what it means, when he says it.  What does it mean?  I don't know.  What does it mean to you, when I say it to you?  I think...  Something I've heard before is 'what did you say about my Mother?'  In the context of...  'He called my Abolita (sp?) 'biz snatch'.'  What are you saying about my Mother???  Aaaah.  So...  What are you saying about my Mother?  'Tell her, I said 'hello'.''  What does that mean?  Well...  Context.  Let's suppose that I am your teacher in school and I tell you to do xyz.  And you think that maybe you shouldn't do xyz.  And I say 'tell your Mother that I said Hello'.  Maybe what I mean to convey is that if you don't do what I say then I will tell your Mother and she will force you to do what I say.  I think that that is probably the context.  How is your Mother, Chris Hipkins?  Tell her I said Hello.  I mean to say...  I imagine him going home to his mother and saying...  Uh...  So...  This person today told me to say 'Hi' to you.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  What does Chris Hipkins Mummy think that it means?  What could it mean?  What, feasibly, could it mean?  Who is this person?  Are they threatening Christopher darling?  What is going on?  Kind or sort of a calling card...  Perhaps...  I don't know.  We see by their reaction or response.  Don't we?  Isn't that what a calling card is, or is for?  HOw did the NZ Government respond or react to alleged atrocities in China?  Let me guess 'hey, it's nothing that we aren't in fact doing to our people.  Permission to carry on'.  And so on and so forth.  It's like the Government of Australasia thinks that they have been God appointed to manage or keep deprived and disempowered the citizens or people of this region.  A sort of hangover from the leaders of this region being appointed to manage the prison population of the northern hemisphere.  They haven't grown out of that way of thinking about the people who are (though no fault of their own) born here.  And also the various people who were lured here, who, to the best of their knowledge, genuinely came in to help when the leader cry cry cry cry cry that they don't have any capable or skilled people who happened to be born here or who were picked to train here etc.</p>

    <p>Apologies...  Answer to 'who supports me in the enterprise' (the enterprise being somewhat open to interpretation) is...  The zeitgist of the time.  International community.  The release of Persona 5 Royal (also 4 Golden and 3) on multi-platform (PC since ages ago, Playstation exclusive in first place, x box thanks Microsoft, Nintendo for all the children of the world  yayyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!) Who doesn't support me?  Seriously?  What's the f*cking problem???
    </p>

    <p>Nobody in New Zealand is fit to stand trial.  Didn't you know?  New Zealand keeps a bunch of people on Medical Doctor Registration and Payroll to tell the courts that they don't think it is in their patients best interests to have a fair trial in front of a jury where they can defend themselves or a lawyer can put forward a defence case for them.  Rather, it is in their patients best interests to not have a trial at all.  To be held indefinately by the psychiatric hospital system of New Zealand.  Shining beacon of developed world Medicine that it is (that New Zealand and foreign graduates both are not allowed to see inside it or staff it).  Is it open to the UN inspectors?  No.  Course not.  Who will make us?  You and whose army?
    </p>

    <p>Some surgeon or other says that you have to be careful to manage hospitals properly else you will end up with inequities.  But that's not the concern.  The money and the time and the energy and the effort and all of the work that goes into insuring that they will only be imporoperly managed with genocidal intent.  No?  Where is the evidence to the contrary?
    </p>

    <p>I suppose really the idea/l  behind making the NCEA test publically available or accessible is to drive up the prices for the Cambridge Curriculum stuff.  Similarly, if you keep the public schools poorly so that the school does not do anything about kids who are being targeted or victimised or harrassed or whatever then the idea is tha the kids parents will pay more and more and more money to that school or another one in order for their kid to have the 'best possible educational experience' which isn't about education at all.  It's just about bribery and corruption and so on and so forth.  
    </p>

    <p>The trouble is that once they go 'just do this otherwise you will never get your degree' or whatever...  Just pay us a bunch of money else we won't get your kids Cambridge Curriculum test papers out for external examination...  Whatever it is that they are saying...  If you meet their demands and pay the ransom...  Whatever it may be.  Just one more year of slave labor, okay?  Well, what reason do you have to believe that they will do what they said they would do if you did your part of things?  I mean to say, if they are corrupt enough to not honor the contracts in the first place (one year of honest labor for the qualiflication that states, effectively, that that was what was done) then what reason do you have to think they will deliver on their end.  One year late?  Two years late?  Five generations?  
    </p>

    <p>Australasia does not have a training and education system, at all.  The UMAT test (Australasian) was fairly clearly bogus in a way that is comparable to how they seem determined to show off NCEA as  being bogus as well.  They replaced it with the Cambridge examination...  But what reason do we have to think there is any honesty and integrity in the Cambridge Curriculum or examination process?  How long ago was it that they said they didn't need to get students examination scores before knowing who was offered places in Universities in England.  Apparently they  were deciding which students they wanted and THEN giving them the external examination score that justified their decision.  It was not the case that the independnet or external or relatively objective examination score was determining offer of place at the tertiary education institutions of England.  So...  Why would we have any more faith in the UCAT or Cambridge curriculum than what we have in the Australasian System?  There's nobody  home.  Nothing there.
    </p>

    <p>The equity thing is besides the point (justice and fairness) once the rich people realise that they are obvious and clear targets for extortion and the like.  Having money won't buy you or your progeny healthcare or education or whatever...  You are only more likely to be targeted for demands and extortion.  But sure.  Do everything everything anything anything you can to expediate the selection and graduation and employment for your kids at the expense of everyone else.  You do that, then.  Congradulations.  The world that you made.
    </p>

    <p>Apparently the suspected suicide rate in New Zealand is falling.  I wonder how many other nations think that it is 'not suspicious' for people to just suddenly drop dead out of the blue.  Like Mason Pendrous.  Just up and died.  No reason to think he had a congenital issue or anything.  People just up and die.  Don't you know?  Not suicide.  Not wrongful death.  Not manslaughter.  Not murder.  Lowest rate of perceived corruption in the world...  Lowest rate of successful prosecution of corruption related offences in the world.  Medical Doctors say that it is not in their patients interest to appear before the court and say anything to the court in their own defence.  It is not in their patients interest to appear before the court and say anything to the jury in their own defence.  And the court...  Justices?  Injustices?  What do they rule on that?  What right to a trial?  What innocent until proven guilty?  What of the lower bar on civil proceedings?  What right to justice?  What people?  Cattle to the slaughter -- right?

<h3>(25 October 2022)</h3>

<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FG85wVSV3o</p>

<p>I suppose the NCEA pilot was made  by people who were reluctant to have such a thing rolled out to the schools because they know for a variety of reasons why it would  be a bad idea for such a thing to be rolled out to the schools of New Zealand.  I mean to say, the examination...  Oozes protest from the people who  made it.  What is pretty shocking (that proves their point actually) is that it got through higher ups.  It was okayed to be rolled out in pilot form.  It was made available to the public so that the public could see what a sh*t show it is and what a sh*t show any examination like that in New Zealand would be</p>

<p>I never really thought before on who writes the NCEA examinations.  Why?  Because I am not a psychopath.  But if I make a bit of an effort to completely and utterly disregard ethics and humanity and so on...  Embrace the idea that it's sooooooooo competive then, of course, such a thing seems very relevant.  Did Chris Hipkins Mummy write the examinations?  Before he sat them?  I don't know who wrote them.  I don't know if the people who wrote them also are involved with teaching students directly or involved with tutoring or teaching curriculum more directly for some kids or some teachers compared to other ones.  Such that the people who decide the 'best answers' are providing those to the kids they are determined will be seen or found to be doing the best in the tests that they wrote for them to do the best in.
</p>

<p>I don't know who edits the examination scripts.  How many people have access to it, I mean to say.  Then it needs to be printed off and put into packets and sent to the schools.  So then various people transporting them and keeping them in the schools have access to them.  And, of course, some teachers are only on payroll because their students are expected to do the  best and others are only on payroll because their students are expected to do the worst.  Various different ways you would have of handling the examination scripts test and answer booklets both to ensure that those ends are met.  
</p>

<p>Level of corruption.
</p>

<p>Of course the qualification that Jacinda recieved from Harvard was not one of the standard qualifications that that Univerity hands out.  How do we think of it?  She was 'streamed' into an 'Honorary Degree':  https://commencement.harvard.edu/honorary-degrees.  What does that mean?  I suppose one way to think of it is that it is a qualification that is handed out on or for political or diplomatic grounds.  A way of the University saying 'we approve of things you are doing and we are happy for you to be associated with the University'.  It is not supposed to be a way of saying that she did the work required for the qualification.  It is not saying that she 'read laws' as it used to be.  The idea of 'readers' at university.  And law, particularly, having actual laws that you study and try and figure what is permitted and what is prohibited and so on and so forth.  For example, Roe vs Wade was a case where the supreme court judges ruled that even though there was no explicit mention of a mothers right to abort a fetus or not in the constitution of the USA the federal court had authority or power to prohibit individual states from deciding upon their own laws.  So the issue is one of the supreme court judges overstepping their authority.  Compare theis to how Australia refuses to uphold it's own consittution by saying that it doesn't matter that it is in the Australian consittution that New Zealand is a state of Australia they refuse to supply voting papers and passports and so on to New Zealanders.  They dont' care what is in their own consittution because they refuse to uphold it. </p>

<p>Are all Australasian qualfications honorary qualifications only?  I mean to say, there is little to nothing more to the Universisites of Australasia saying that you have one than them saying something along the lines of 'we approve of things you are doing and we are happy for you to be associated with the university'?  Is that all it means to have a qualification from an Australasian Univesrity?  Does it indicate or tell the world that, if you claim to have a graduate research qualification, you handed over bribe or exit payments or agreed to slave for the university over and above and beyond in order to have obtained the qualification at all?  Is that what it means?  Is having one supposed to proclaim or broadcast to the world that the individual who  has one is corrupt?  So to make the graduand a target for further exploitation and abuse?  Is that the plan?  So people from foreign countries don't have qualms about falsely advertising jobs they have no intention of ever paying anybody to do?  Is that the plan?  
</p>

<p>The Universities simply refuse to get the work out to external examiners, in a timely fashion, for the qualification the student applied to be enrolled in.  That would be like getting a kids examination script out to be examined for the wrong qualification. So the examiner goes through their answers together with the grading schedule for the wrong examination.  So they can only mark them wrong because that's the degree to which they were set up by New Zealand Education.  Or, if the supervisor or NZ post or the people who receive scripts to pass on to graders simply throw away the booklets they have received from some students.  Record 'zero' against their name.  The students dropped out or failed to answer a single question all volutary like.  All voluntary.</p>

<p>The extent of the state of corruption in New Zealand.
</p>

<p>All the energy and effort expended in voluntarily removing or excluding people -- not because they think those people would fail if they did the examination.  But because it was decided in advance that many steps were going to be taken to ensure that they failed because they saw that if they did not take all of those steps to ensure they failed they would likely pass.  The lengths they go to to fail people who would pass if they would simply stop being a f*cking obstacle and get out of the f*cking way.
    </p>

<p>
It's sooooooooo competitive.  All the people on payroll to 'help' who are only hired into those positions because they agree to help themselves to the people who have been placed in their 'care'.  Every f*cking time.  The lengths they go to to ensure that only people such as these will be on payroll in the 'helping' professions.  The constant push to have the most impoverished and incapable injured and incapacitated population in the whole f*cking world.  No?  That's not the goal or the aim or the purpose or the point?  But it's soooooooooooo competitive!!!!  It's soooooooooo competitive!!!!!  There's no room for the both of us.  It's you or me.  And it's me.  I win.  It's me.  It's me.  It will be you over my dead body.  No.  We will not get your work out to examiners.  We will not calculate your GPA according to the algorithm that we published for the purposes of accountability.  We will not be accountable.  We can't count.  We can't add up your GPA.  You can't count.  You think we are SQuigley fixing the numbers.  Cooking the books.  Burning the whole f*cking house down.  Indeed.  Evivdence to the contrary?
</p>

<p>Okay...  So, what's going on.  Why focus on orthopedics, particularly..  As most corrupt, I mean to say.  As the scummiest of the scams.  I suppose it is because of the prevalence of orthopedic people, in New Zealand.  See, when Australia wants to distance itself from particularly corrupt practices in New Zealand it distances itself  by making it seem that there is some kind of autonomy in New Zealand.  I mean to say, there isn't an Australasian College of General Pracice or or Psychiatry anymore.  Rather, there are New Zealand and Australasian ones that are separate.  Why?  I suppose the best I can figure as to why that would be so is becuase it means they collect up 2x the fees for people applying to those colleges.  How much does it cost to apply to be accepted to train as a GP?  You apply to the colleges, right?  Hope to get picked to do that.  Roughly how many colleges are you supposed to apply to?  This is to go into a training position at the end of your 2 years of being a house officer in the various hospitals.  Do you pay them, is it $1,0000 per application?  So if you apply to the NZ GP and the Australain GP and the NZ Psychiatry and the Australain Psychiatry and the NZ Orthopedics and the Australian Orthopedics.  That will cost you at least $6,000 - and of course it might cost more actually and some of those funds will be Australaian dollars.  But they will have to do a roll call (so to speak or so to say) of how many of the junior doctors working in the hospitals (particularly ones they are keen to pass off as  being registrars who have been accepted to train with a college, particularly ones they are keen to pass off as being emergency physicians when training to be an emergency physician is a speciality or specialisation of it's own)..  ANyway, point is that they take their money for applying and then they don't accept any of their applications.  So now they, what?  What do they do?  Keep working in the hospital as a junior doctor...  Forever?  Walk away from Medicine entirely, then.  That's right.  Now it's time to progress your career but we don't have any doctors we would rather not have any doctors at all than have you.  So say the specialist colleges etc.  Right?  That's not how it doesn't work?  Isn't it?  </p>

<p>Many of the colleges have withrdawn from New Zealand.  They say that it isn't safe to teach in the hospitals.  They say it isn't possible for them to practice in the hospitals of New Zealand.  For example, the Radiologists say that they can't trian studnets and they can't actually do radiology, even if they are qualified, when Dunedin keeps dumping the MRI machines and not software updating them and so on and so forth.  Can't do it.  So radiology services withdrawn from Dunedin, then.  Oh.  So now they will need to pay 'external consultants' much much much higher fees.  Those external consultants will need to see about how they are going to build their own infrastructure of MRI machines, say, because the public sector was too f*cking corrupt and refused to do it and so the people don't have access to the radiology services.  Instead they will have to hemorrhage that money to external consultants who cannot function in the public sector becuase it was too corrupt.</p>

<p>It was also a way of preventing mobilisation or mobility from New Zealand to Australia.  Because New Zealand chooses to be such that nobody would stay in New Zealand Voluntariliy if they could get to Australia (Canada, UK, USA, anywhere else -- right?  Mostly focusing on English speaking nations because mostly people from these parts don't know any other international languages I don't mean to be dismissive of other nations).  New Zealand chooses to be that.  That's what it wants to be.  Right?  So then, it must keep slaves.  It must ensure that the people don't have other options.  It must record that they fail the tests. It was a broadway show, I believe, that went 'if you can make it in New York you can make it anywhere!'.  We have the message 'you can't even make it in New Zealand, you can't make it anywhere!'  That's the message that the New Zealand Governmetn likes to convey to the people it works to very very hard to fail and bully and exclude.  That's the message.  They don't think that people will stay if they don't keep them as slaves.  Refuse to acknoweldge and sign off on the work that they have done.  Bully them into voluntarily dying, before they will let them go away.  If you love something you set it free.  They don't love the people of New Zealand.  They love to abuse them.  There's a difference.  They love to keep them as slaves.  They would rather see them dead than see them or hear of them being any other way.  So teh idea of there being any 'helping profession' at all really does not make any sense.  It's sooooooo competitive.  Right?</p>

<p>
Anyway...  So we have New Zealand colleges of Orthopedics and they say that you can only apply to NZ or Australia and not both at the same time.  I suppose so that people waste a year that they would not otherwise.  Well, they see, don't they.  Will you apply to NZ first becuase you believe that it will be easier to get into that one.  Right?  Or do you apply to Australia first because you have more faith and confidence that they have a developed world training programme for Orthopedics.  Are you maybe concerned about trying to do Orthopedics in a country or nation that doesn't have Radiology services in most of it (has lost accreditation to train people to do those things) so getting a radiology consult on any scans you have done prior to surgery etc...  Well..  Who would want to train in New Zealand rather than Australia?  If you actually cared about doing the job properly, I mean to say.  Anyway... 
</p>

<p>I am getting there.  I am getting there.  I am providing context.  So, in this context, we want to think about what is going on with the ACC billings.  That is my point.  Why think that they are any less incorrect or any less corrupt than the othe records, e.g., the patients health records recording crimes and so on.  The persons education records.  Falsely recording enrolments and falsely recording outcomes of examination that were never performed.  So to speak.  So to say.  I remember reading about...  I think it was the US.  I think it was a peer reviewed journal.  They were doing 'experiments' on knee surgery.  They wanted to know whwether athroscopic surgery (where they debride the joint, I think) was effective or not.  You can roughly think of it as an oil change for the joint, right?  Instert a needle.  Maybe a scope.  Try and clear out some of the rough surface of the joint.  Sometihng like that.  There's a mechanical reason or grounds or rationale.  Right?  For this to be a thing.  That people need to have done.  That teh government pays orthopedic surgeons to do?  So they can do however many of them per year, or whatever.  So, anyway, they were doing an experiment on whether the procedure was effective, or whether people who said they felt better after the procedure were having an placebo response.
</p>

<p>So they actually did a trial where some of the people were anesthetised and a cut was made on their knee and they were given stitches so they had as much sort of superficial or surface reason to believe that they had the operation in fact as other people who did have the operation.  And what they found was that (in that particular experiment) the actual procedure did not seem to be much of any help, actually.  Compared to people believing.  There's a bunch of reasons why that might be the case.  The issues or problems observed in the joint could have  been due to inflammation, say, and the persons body might have cleared the joint up once the person took proper rest that they took because they believed they had just had an operation.  Or their employees beleived they needed proper rest.  Or their kids.  Or their wifes.  Or whatever.  Point is that there could  be mechanical reasons why it wasn't just 'all in their head' that the pretend operation was actually effective.  This is sort of why people got to thinking that maybe we should try and treat most things with fake operations rahter than actual operations.  Just give people the knock out drug and knock them out for a bit.  Put a bit of a cut and some stitches.  Then their own body will have the time and...  Excuse.  Social permission.  Whatever.  To let the body do what the body does and homoeostatis!  Heal thyself!
</p>

<p>Now we come back to the issue of billables.  We come back to the issue of who is in the OR and what they are doing in the OR.  What it is that they are trained to do.  What it is that they are actually capable of doing.  What it is that teh whole sh*t show is billing for, and so on.  I mean...  Hey...  If the above is kind of sort of true...  Then we can get a very junior person, maybe  nurse, who is competent to knock someone out briefly indeed.  Surface sedation.  Superficial cut and stitches.  But that gets billed or invoiced as...  So we have this problem,  now, of corruption in the weay the hospitals are billing.  There's a bit of a problem in the US with (if we get out of our heads a bit over the nasty insurance companies and appreciate that people are trying to scam them all the time.  Not so much partiuclar individuals but more a sort of en masse corruption).  How many joint arthroscopies are claimed every year?  How many are actually done?  Any?  I mean...  There are all kinds of things like that.  In the US there was a problem of the hospital checking out what the patient was insured for so they had the list of billables before they go looking for how much they can bill out of that patient.  I guess because it's sooooooo competitive.  Every hospital is just trying to stay afloat.  The administration is scuttling to take as much money out of the whole thing as they can before the inevitable collapse.
</p>

<p>And Australasia sees how things are in other parts of the world and various people focus on the worst aspects and think that their purpose or function or goal in this world is to make things be as bad as possible as quickly quickly quickly as they can.  And all the infrastructure that goes into shutting people down and shutting people up so that we can kill or maim as many people as possible as quickly as we can.  That's why various people are patting themselves on the back for the wonderful job that they do and how grand life is for them?  No?  Yes?
</p>

<p>
    Who wins the most if the New Zealand education system is completely and utterly undermined?  I suppose people from every other nation.  Australia will get cheap slaves, effectively.  Or similar, right?  It will refuse to  hire New Zealanders for skilled jobs because it refuses to formally acknowledge them.  Only when it suits, I suppose.  The daughter of the VC of Queensland's qualifications are formally acknowledged within Australia and maybe overseas.  Used to be that Australian trained Medical Doctors were to be found in the hospitals and so on of the US.  But Australia doesn't want to let the slaves go either.  Does it?  I guess the daughter of the VC wasn't a slave.  Was she?  She wasn't a hostage to her Father's desires.  Was she?  He was giving is precious precious my precious everything that she could ever possibly have wanted if she knew what was good for him I mean her I mean him I mean her.  Right?  
</p>

<p>Why would we think that ACL surgeries are any different?  Maybe because at some point the patient can be shown imaging or a scan or whatever that provides evidence that something was actually done.  Why would we think that the scan or whatever they are shown is actually their scan or whatever they are shown?  I am trying to think of why New Zealand will not have radiologists working in New Zealand.  We have a few people in New Zealand who refuse to accept people into that training programme, refuse to provide acceditation to any new radiologists etc etc.  It is quite the scam.  No?  Evidence to the contrary?
</p>

<p>I see that Australia appears to have shut up about having a referendum on altering the Australian Constitution so as to make it explicit that Aboriginal people are, in fact, regarded as Australians.  To be counted in census, to be provided with voting papers, and so on.  At least, I am not seeing it in the media, anymore.  It does not appear to make any difference what is or is not in the Australian Consitution.  Look at how Australia treats New Zealanders when it is in the Australian Constitution that New Zealand is a state of Australia.  Does Australia treat New Zealanders better or worse or much the same as they treat Australian Aboriginals?  I don't know what to say about that...  I don't know.  Isn't Australia trying to genocide the lot of them?  Apparently they can't genocide New Zealanders because they refuse to accept 'New Zealander' as an ethnicity.  They re-code people's self proclaimed or professed ethnicity on New Zealand census saying that anybody who proclaims to be a 'New Zealander' is a 'New Zealand European' person.  Divide and conquer.  Right?  Australia refuses to supply passports and voting papers to New Zealanders.  Many travelled to Australia with promise of employment where there was not employment for them in New Zealand.  In return Australia...  What?  I have documented how the Australian National University thought that it would get more and more and more money for keeping me working as slave.  Right?  Kim Sterelny was doing that at Victoria, Wellington.  Wellington wellington wellington wells, we are SO HAPPY!!!  Right?  And then they wanted him to roll out the same slave-programme for the Australian National University.  Apparently the Philosophy Programme there is no more.  They weren't willing or able to employ anybody to work in the programme who has the willingness or ability to supervise graduate research in any topic in Philosophy.  Wow. That's quite the pronouncement from the Administration of the Australian National University.  About the status of Australasia's premiere Research Institution.  I guess the idea is that they get get more money out of people to have the pay Australian Dollars to purchase positions of slavery from within teh US system?  Is that the idea/l?  So they can keep them working for how many decades on their 5 year PhD (3 year thesis after 2 years coursework).  Wasn't it?  If Australia wanted to bill for having the student for 5 years... Then why not develop 2 years of graduate level coursework?  Oh.  The plan is only to pay people who don't have the capacity to supervise graduate level research or teach graduate level courses...  I see...  The plan was to...  Have a detention camp of people who no speak English teh Australian Constitution?  Was that the idea/l?

                        <h3>Undermining Medical Training in Australasia (24 October 2022)</h3>

                        <p>There was this idea about how Medical Doctors in the USA were rich.  Of course, people also invested a lot of time and also money in training to be a Medical Doctor.  Years of paying the Universities instead of being paid salaries to work.  Also very high training fees.  The idea/l (anyway) was that it created a bonded labor system where people were motivated financially to live modestly in order to pay off high loans while working after graduation.  
                        </p>

                        <p>People start looking, then, how they can get an advantage in this system.  People start looking into whether they can find a cheaper training system, particularly, so they can earn USA salaries with cheaper training costs.  People turned to Australia to see if they could qualify to practice Medicine in the USA by investing in a cheaper training system.  Australia seemed happy to take students money.  Then, perhaps, started to feel entitlted to withhold graduation until they believed they had received the money they were entitled to (comparable money or perhaps even more money than would have needed to have been paid into the US training system).  I don't know.
                        </p>

                        <p>The University of Queensland used to (at least) get the students sitting Step 1 examinations (part of accreditation for US Medical Students) before doing internships.  They used to (at least) offer students internships in Florida.  They were helping students qualify to practice in the US after graduating from Queensland, I mean to say.  I suppose this would have  been part of their marketing to justify them charging higher training prices.  I don't know.
                        </p>

                        <p>People must have really had a personal problem with the Vice Chancellor of Queensland or his daughter because there were complaints about him having arranged for or knowingly allowed the University to offer his daughter enrolment in Medicine when she was not rank order scored high enough for offer of place according to their published criterion on how they were to offer places.  They had said that giving her a place when her rank order score was too low was justified on grounds that she was a 'leadership equity candidate'.  But I don't think that she applied to be considered as such.  I don't know.  I do know that the VC voluntarily resigned.  He was not prosecuted for corruption (using public training places for private advantage) and also his daughter was not removed from the programme on grounds that it was not her fault.  I don't know that it was plausible to think that she did not know that she had not earned her place (she would have known what the objective criterion was and she would have known whether or not she qualified for equity consideration).  No reparation was given to the student whose place they stole.  I don't know that that student was ever contacted or informed about the situation.
                        </p>

                        <p>So, the first patient that dies, on her watch, where it was some sort of medical error.  I suppose she needs to live with it on her conscience that the student whose place she stole might have not caused a wrongful death.  I simply cannot comprehend how she cannot resign, given the circumstances.  If she really wants to do Medicine I think her Daddy probably has sufficient funding (from all lhis years of being Vice Chancellor) to pay the very best tutors and teachers to help her study for and earn a place in some programme or other.  If that's what she really really wants to do.  Or maybe she just wants to be a wrongful deathbringer with all her friends.  I don't know.  Maybe the plan was for her to get a US consultant salary without any student loans at all from Australia since the public sector bankrolled her public university training.  I don't know what the plan was or what she or her Daddy is doing now.
                        </p>

                        <p>So we can understand the situation a bit better as to why and how it is that other people don't have access to timely quality medical care.  Because some people want to be rich and they also possibly want to be wrongful deathbringers, as well.  Who knows what other kinds of perverted motivations and desires they have that supposedly justifies them taking from the public sector for their own private advantage to the considerable expense of everybody else.
                        </p>

                        <p>So, the way that Australia was to the USA...  Where Australia was trying to use it's position as a back-door to the USA (and aiming to catch those people and profiteer from them and so on) is how Australia sees the role of New Zealand in relation to Australia.  That is or means to say, all the people who are prepared to bank-roll the Universities of Otago or Auckland because it's cheaper than paying Australian Dollars to the University of Queensland or Sydney or Melbourne or the ANU or the Univesrity of Western Australia etc etc.  So they think they are justified or entitled to teach them a little lesson in extorting the money they believe they are owed by withholding graduation.  I suppose that is part of it.  To try and extract comparable fees out of them (at the very least, I would suppose) at the end of the day.  
                        </p>

                        <p>Would you like to do business with Australasia?
                        </p>

                        <p>Western Australia seemed to have a set-up that pre-dated or pre-existed Harlene Hayes.  That involved students being selected in to the Medical Programme when they were still in High School.  When they were 17 or 18, I mean to say, before they had done any University study at all.  I don't know how much money you needed to offer the University (or who your Daddy or Mummy had to be) in order to get a place in that programme.  I don't know how much money they demand before they will sign off on completion or allow their students to graduate.  I don't know if the idea is to not graduate anybody from that University.  Just collect up all the money in fees for, well, as long as you are getting away with it, I suppose.  Then, whatever.  Close the University down, then.  It isn't like there aren't enough Medical Schools in Australasia.  Right?  Drive up places at the other ones, then.
                        </p>

                        <p>The University of Otago had a similar plan.  They were being bankrolled by the wealthy Aucklanders, for the most part, it seemed.  They were sending their kids well out and away from the Grammar Zone (that was a trap for internationals mostly about driving up housing prices and the like).  The wealthy New Zealanders were sending their kids to private boarding schools in rural environments.  People employed to work with these kids were working with them making their CV's and writing their entry blurbs for the Universities of England and the USA.  Making them websites and so on.  Why would these kids who have every possible education advantage that their parents money could buy voluntarily choose to go to Otago instead of Harvard or Yale or, I don't know.  Somewhere in California.  Oxford.  Whatever.  Wherever.  Who voluntariliy chooses to go to Otago when their parents are earning, apparently, around quarter or half million New Zealand dollars per year in their capacity and role as 'civil servant' for the people of New Zealand?
                        </p>

                        <p>One idea is that it is cheaper.  Considerably so.  Obviously.  Another idea is that they don't get accepted to study either on some sort of scholarship or as a full fee paying student.  I don't know how actually competitive it is to get to go to Harvard or whatever if you are actually paying them full fees for 4 years of undergraduate and then another 4 years of graduate for the law or medicine (or business, I think) vocational graduate degrees.  I don't know...  Possible the programmes are full of the corrupt officials children from over there.  I don't know.
                        </p>

                        <p>Anyway...  It looks like they are willing to sacrifice or implode Otago for the benefit or good (perceieved) to Western Australia.  I mean to say, that if people get wind of Otago refusing to graduate 1/3rd of the Medical Cohort then it drives up the prices that Western Australia can charge for enrolment there, into that Degree.  Right?  I don't think Australia cares if the Universities of New Zealand implode.  It will just drive up prices for the Australian Universities.  Right?  And who cares if the Australasian Education and Training System implodes?  More jobs for the graduates of the US Universities, I suppose.  I mean, if the Australasians won't graduate wrongful deathbringers of their own they can probably ship them over from Harvard.  
                        </p>

                        <p>That seems to be the end game, doesn't it?  Like swarms of locusts decimating everything in their path.  The administration.
                        </p>

                        <p>They need to look into the small group of people who are allegedly or apparently making the decisions about who is allowed to be registered to practice in various specialities (ranging from GP to psychiatry to obgyn to general surgery to neurosurgery etc etc).  What reason do we have to believe these people to be any less corrupt than the people responsible for admissions and graduations at Australasian Universities?  I mean to say, I wonder what you will find...  10 men aged between 65 and 104?  People who have decided that keeping their group small and exclusive means that they get bankrolled for however much money they like (millions and millions for 'external consultant') while they never set foot in the hospitals.  While they take more and more and more and more money from students applying to purchase study materials and / or to sit examinations (that are neither well designed nor graded fairly) and / or in repeated applications to the training programme.  All the volunteer work they are instructed to have on their CV's it's soooooooo competitive, all of the courses they have done at University over and above (more and more and more and more fees).  When this small group has no intention whatsover of signing off on anybody else.  They will have to die (all of them) before the people of Australasia can have timely quality health care.  It's just not something that will ever happen on or under their watch.  There is no education and training system.  It's a scummy scam of a hoax.  Where is the evidence to the contrary?
                        </p>
                        
                            
                                <p>These people believe they are entitled, because of how badly they were treated when they were younger, to treat a new generation (or two, or three, or four...) worse than they were treated when they were coming through.  I mean to say, nothing quite tells you that you made it in life than getting to treat other people worse than other people treated or treat you.  Right?  Isn't that the basic or fundamental idea/l?  Who signed you off, Sterelny?  For how many years did you need to work on your PhD?  Did you write it all by yourself or did the likes of Frank Jackson write it for you?  How about the various other pieces that you wrote in Philosophy of Mind?  Was that your work or did your supervisor help you?  What was the fate of the work that you wrote all by yourself?  For how many years did you have to work before you got a job in Philosophy, again?  And the only job that you were offered was from Wellington.  Right?  Was that right?  Because there wasn't anybody in New Zealand who wanted a job in Philosophy, they had to hire from overseas.  But more in particular they were only willing to hire someone who had internalised the message that he couldn't actually do Philosophy, what he was doing wasn't actually Philosophy, he wouldn't actually do any work in Philosophy...  But he can edit a journal so that everybody else's work comes to him for distribution for credit.  Right?  Was that the basic idea?  I guess there are all these Medical Specialists on various committees who decide who the next generation of Medical Specialists are going to be.  Who taught them everything they know in their capacity as Medical Specialists?  What are they teaching the next generation?  I mean, you can read the New Zealand Medical Journal (actually you can't becuase it's hidden behind paywall.  Oh, that's a recent change.)  You can read about how the only people they will acknowledge as surgeons refuse to do surgical safety checklists and so on (that require people to state their name and registration number and role that they are playing in the operation today / state the reason for them being present in the OR and itemise all of the things that are on the f*cking tray, and all of the things that are required to be on the f*cking tray before the most senior person says that it is time to close).  I wonder why that is.. That they are refusing to do surgical safety checklists.  I'm sure the video camera footage (there are video cameras in every OR) would be able to tell you why that is.  I'd be pretty f*cking certain that they could tell  you, in little to no time at all, what the major problems are, in the hospitals, of New Zealand.  Corruption.  Hey.
                                </p>

                                <p>I would imagine that the situation is that they don't pay them.  Right?  Something something about them exhanging hostages.  Kids.  Whatever.  Make it look like you care about your kids and you have invested in them.  Now you want a return on your investment.  The University is supposed to return to you someone with a Medical Qualification that means they are required to be payrolled anywhere in the world because there is a global shortage of Medical Doctors.  Right?  So, then...  But little darling can't graduate on time because because because because because...  Because of an unpaid library fine?!  Because of the wonderful things that she does?  Unlikely...  I suppose the situation is that the Vice Chancellor gave everything that he had -- in exhange for his daughter getting to be a Medical Graduate of the University of Queensland.  Not sure if she was given a passing grade for the Step 1 exam or if she managed to refrain from sexually molesting anybody during the Clinical Exam...  Or whatever it is that they get you to do in order to pass you...  Whatever it is that they choose to do to you.  Right?  Anything?  Anything!  Anything anything anything!!  No?  Well then just walk away and die chump.  Suicided all voluntary like.  Was brought in by the volunteers.  We don't pay them so they need to find or make their money.  Can get serum sold on the market these days.  Fetal tissue for New Zealand Natural Cosmetics and so on.  Chuck it into the infant formula.  Whatever.  Why would we think that these things do not occur?  I guess it's the high quality documentation of the checks and balances and so on that we have.  What's that?  We don't?  There aren't any?  Huh.  Whoever would have though that the country that has the lowest rate of successful prosecution of corruption related offences in the world would be so negligent in it's documentation.  Smile New Zealand.  You are on candid camera.  With international cloud servers documenting the crimes..  Documenting the crimes..  Documenting the crimes...
                                </p>

                                <p>Was Nitche that said something about how people didn't need to believe in God in order to behave morally or ethically.  I think that was the idea.  So it was okay to pronounce that God is Dead because people's morality or ethics or whatever did not rely on belief in God.  Do people behave better when they know that there are security cameras all about the hospital, though?  Documenting the paid actors or unpaid actors present in order to portray to everybody that the problem is that it's soooooooooooo busy...  It's soooooooooooooo busy...  You can't see a medical doctor in a timely fashion (not because there aren't any but because it's soooooooooo busy).  The Medical cameras showing how the University chooses to employ security guards to manage the herd of undergrads kept about 1,0000 to a herd...  500, at least..  To split themselves between the main lecture theatre and however many overflow rooms.  OOooooooh better hury hury hury into the mosh pit that is first year science...  It's sooooooooo competitive!  Soooooooo competitive.  Meanwhile, various other rooms around campus kept empty or closed.  What was that?  They chose to open up a wall because they knew that behind the wall there was asbestos.  That's how they closed many rooms around the Dunedin hospital.  Right?  They turned clinical rooms into managment and nonclinical rooms.  Then they opened up the walls saying that they had found aesbestos.  Corruption...
                                </p>

                                <p>I guess that's why the war is currently or presently, in part, about the health records.  The documentation that there is, and the documentation that there is not, that comprises the health records that the executive (the public hospitals) are keeping against the people of New Zealand.  The unlawful druggings (medications requiring prescription were administrered without being signed off as having been prescribed by clinicians with the appropriate credentials and authority).  What's that?  Clinicians with the appropriate credentials cannot function or be employed in the hospitals of New Zealand.  They can't do their jobs.  There aren't any people to do the job.  We don't have any people registered to practice medicine in NZ.  We don't have any medical hospitals.  Right?  It's about unlawfully detaining and maiming and drugging.  Where is the evidence that it is not?  Where is the evidence that it is a functioning hospital?  Who are teh clinical workers on payroll?  Jeeeepers.  The idea is that New Zealand will make things sooooooooooo haaaaaaaaaarrd that they'll just decide to bomb the country and start all over again.  That would be faster than having to deal with the f*cking New Zealand administration.  Right?  They know this, that's why they are presently building bomb shelters under 'hospitals' they have no intention of staffing.  Right?
                                </p>

                                <p>What a f*cking joke.  NZ is still dragging it's heels on the abuse in STATE care.  It won't do it.  It is making it be about the Churches.  Is that what the UN said to do?  No?  Why not?  Do we haz most bsics skkz in rdng comp what did they just say?  Repeat it back to me?  What did they say?  And a few sentances on why?  Seriously?  They are going to fail New Zealanders for their stupid f*cking pilot tests while the HIGHEST LEVEL OF ADMINISTRATION is either too f*cking stupid else too f*cking corrupt. Which is it?  I guess ignorance is no excuse, when or once you get to certain levels or stages or whatever.  When I say I am worried about my maths ability and other people exclude me because they are choosing to fiddle the books...  SQuiggley fix the books.  Right Squiggley?  Don't worry, Quiggley is fixing the books for the University of Waikato.  All is well, in his world.  How many FTE of Master's students have you had over the last 10  years at the University, Squiggley?  For how many applications to enrol?  It's soooooooooooo competitive.  It's soooooooooo competitive that the Universities are competing amongst each other or themselves, apparently, to keep mor eand more hostages for more and more time...  They aren't hostages?  What do you call it when you don't pay your workers?  You were supposed to pay them by handing over the qualification.  How many graduate students have you graduated lately?  Graduations were cancelled 'because of Covid' right?  Did they ever resume?  I know people put on a fancy dress and parade about (like Jacinda) but I'm talking about people getting the qualifiation for the work that they did for the degree they were enrolled in.  Are you keeping an unlawful slave or detention camp or are you keeping a university?  Let's see how you've been SQuiggley fixing your books to ensure that people don't leave New Zealand with qualifications.
                                </p>

                                <p>About 1/4 of NZ population have fled the country.  Migrants are flocking out of here.  They say they don't keep records on how many people who come here with intent to stay end up fleeing.  They don't record departures.  New Zealand is a problem because our people are part of the migrant flocks forced to flee because of the corruption,  here.  The governmetn here says that our best and brightest flee.  That's the way they see it.  They believe they are forcing the best and brightest to flee.  Once they realise how they are to be kept in New Zealand.  Apparently foreign governments are supposed to be grateful that they can take the best and brightest from here and treat them as 3rd class locals.  That's what NZ intends to contribute to the developmetn of the world.  Slaves trained to be slaves who will work for no credit or money and be grateful that they aren't in teh slums of Mombai.  No?  That' snot hte aspirational goal of our government?  To force the best and brighteset to flee away?  That's not the idea?  So that they can be the 'there is no alternative' only game in town.  Anybody who can read a graph more cogently than Chris Hipkins shall be places on the first possible boat out of here for making him look bad.  Right?  There will b e a job for anybody else over his dead  body.  Right?  Him and his children...  And his childrens childrens childrens..  The problem or trouble with inbreeding...  Well, the long game is that it is not sutainable.  We can't afford to have you anymore administration of New Zealand.  Look at how you keep your people.

                        <h3>Undermining the Education and Training System of New Zealand (23-24 October 2022)</h3>


                                <p>Who can't wait to see the documentation as to how New Zealand plans to genocide Niue by making their official language an NCEA subject??
                                </p>

                                <p>RNZ made a pilot maths test available here:  https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/477144/new-ncea-tests-could-jeopardise-maori-and-pacific-students-achievement-rates
                                </p>

                                <p>It isn't really a maths test, of course.  It is propaganda designed to teach students that they have no future in New Zealand and they have no future on this planet.
                                </p>

                                <p>Why do I say that?
                                </p>

                                <p>They insist on making a 'maths examination' be about 'meaningful content'.  So, then, what meanings are conveyed in their contents.  Firstly, it is about grading eggs.  Once that is established it is about some people making the cheapest possible food and distributing that more widely.  It is about not getting enough sleep, the size of your family, the lack of school supplies, the price of a winter jacket.  Then we move into making information about an individual (without their permission) publically available while redacting information not to protect the privacy of the person the information is about but for other reasons.   I mean it tells quite the story, doesn't it.  Culminating in explanations to be written about the prevalence of non muscle strain injuries to muscles.  But that's okay.  The students need to 'explain calculation' before they are allowed to do algebra.  Right?  Tell us a story, Chris Hipkins.  What does calculation mean to you?
                                </p>

                                <p> 
                                <a href="writing/ncea.pdf" target="_self"> I have written a bit of a commentary,  here.</a>  Some of it might be dismissed as 'that's your opinion, it's basically a matter of preference meh' and that's okay.  That would be fair.  Sure.  Let's not hold up the whole thing over quibbles.  But there are fundamental problems, here.
                                <p>

                                <p>The reason why they have so much 'explain' is so that there is a real lack of accountability for why certain students have been given certain grades.  The very very best maths students would be concerned about a question asking them to 'explain calculation' because while they know they are very very good at calculation, or at calculating the correct answer, what calculation is...  Well...  I don't think I've ever heard anybody really explain what calculation actually is.  Why are we asking these questions?
                                </p>

                                <p>It is exactly a set up to fail thing.  NCEA.  I mean to say, the leaders have decided that NCEA is a dead-end failure of an Eduacation and Training System.  Their kids don't do NCEA.  Do they?  They don't study for that. Do they?  They study for the USA examinations and / or the Cambridge Curriculum examinations.  They might feel like rolling the dice or taking their chances or having a go at NCEA but really, how much time are they supposed to spend trying to figure out what to say in a question that asks them to 'explain calculation'?
                                </p>

                                <p>The Government thinks that it's soooooo clever doing the workforce planning and so on...  And it's really not.  Look at the fruits of their labors.  I mean to say look at what New Zealand contributes and look at the skills and so on that they choose to value.  The teachers are correct to say that they don't feel confident teaching the material.  I don't think that any maths teacher would feel confident teaching the material.  It isn't a maths curriculum.  It is what the government has chosen to roll out to the people to waste their time.  The prevention and prohibition of a maths curriculum for New Zealand and New Zealanders.
                                </p>

                                <p>Do you think that attending school would make it more or less likely that you would pass that kind of a test?  I imagine that I would pass that kind of a test on the basis of general knowledge if it was fairly graded.  I mean to say if they weren't deciding who to pass or fail depending on the decile level of the school (or similar).  Maybe there is a step where they expect the school to refuse to collect up examination scripts from certain students (who they know would pass the test if their examination script was fairly graded).  I mean, that's what the University of Waikato does.  Right?  They told me that the reason why they weren't going to get my thesis out to external examiners was because it wasn't good enough to pass.  They said they were soooo worried that external examiners would fail me that I needed to keep working for Waikato so they could help me fix it up so that externals would pass me.  But the truth of it is that they refused to get it to externals (along with the sign off forms) and then instructed me to change it in ways to make it less acceptable to externals rather than more becuase they wanted me to be failed.
                                </p>

                                <p>Why?  Because they thought I would make a better slave.  Their preference to keep people working without pay in conditions of slavery.  Rather than giving them (or allowing others to give them) the qualifications that they have met the requirements for.  They would rather record that the person is not willing and or able to do the work.  They can't do it.  They would rather keep people hostages or slaves.  For every student they fail...  That student goes back to them.  Right?  Until they pass the student.  Right?  They can get more and more and more and more and more and more money the more and more and more students they fail.  The race to the bottom that is New Zealand.
                                </p>

                                <p>We don't have medical doctors or a health system because the aim or goal is for people to die once they've done their work...  Then it is time for them to die and go away.  Pay you never.  Give you credit for your work never.  That is not an education and training system.  Not a ministry of education.  The people on payroll are not teachers.  Right?  It's a detention camp for slaves only.  
                                </p>

                                <p>The USA wrote up about how the people who were getting the exams from the students were changing the answers the students had written before they were getting the examination scripts to examiners.  New Zealand arranges for the examiners to change the answers to ensure that the students are failed.  They don't want the people to do well.  They don't want them to be seen to be doing well.  They try and say they will supply cheap slave workers to the world.  Our leaders do that.  They keep trying to sell out the health of the people and so on.  Why?  Because it's part of the national trauma of New Zealand is why.  The leaders lead or govern here like we haven't progressed to the end of WWII.  Still trying to exerminate the bulk of the popualtion of the country.
                                </p>

                                <p>It is all very 'Brave New World' and so on.  The New Zealand leadership strategy etc etc I mean to say.  Involves a lot of dodgey business dealings with dodgey people, I would suppose.  Various people from Harvard, or whatever, got their funding cut and their projects ended because of ethical qualms etc etc.  So they looked for populations overseas where the slavers or whatever leaders would sell out the health of their people and so on.  See how little they would sell out the  health of their people for, and so on.  New Zealand seems like that.  Like it is trying to be the vision of the world of some dysutopian view of 1960's.  'I'm sooooooo lucky I'm a Gamma Baby I don't have to work half as hard as Chris Hipkins!!'.  I pick on him  because of something I saw that made me think that his Mother is High Up in the Ministry of the Prevention and Prohibition of Education.  Because that wouldn't be a conflict.   Yeah, right.
                                </p>

                                <p>Hmm.  ACC, again.  Last I heard..  I was pretty sure that the ACC was gambling all the money away.  I mean...  They were gambling on the Stock Markets.  Right?  I don't mean that investing in the stock market is gambelling.  I mean that the way that some people try and play the stock market is such that they fall victim or sucker to some strategy or scam or scheme that was obviously or clearly too good to be true completely and utterly in-credible...  Particularly to think that they would be so very very much smarter and more clever than anybody else so they somehow deserved to get so very much richer than everybody else.  That the ACC of New Zealand would play the Americans at the US stock market game and win!  Yeeeeeeeeees.  That sounds like a get rich quick scheme that is destined for success...  Gamblling the money away...  Corruption.  It's tiresome that they play dumb when it makes so much more credible sense that they are ill-motivated.
                                </p>

                                <p>Ahhhh.  It's about the false billings to the ACC.  So...  When I rocked up to the ED they unlawfully detained me in a room and all that.  But they also filled out ACC forms on my behalf.  Now, I never signed the forms.  I mean to say, they claimed money or funding from ACC for having me in the hospital -- but what they claimed about me was false.  Made up.  Not true.  I emailed ACC and told them NOT TO PAY THE AUCKLAND DISTRICT HEALTH BOARD that they had unlawfully detained me in the name of psychiatry (but no psychiatrist had seen me or signed any of the documents that would have made any of that lawful) AND WHAT'S MORE they claimed a  bunch of money from ACC for physical complaints that they told me were all in my head.  I told them not to pay the hospital because they were lying about my physical complaints.  No doctor would sign off on those physical complaints having occureed...  Because there werent' any doctors.  Anyway...  ACC told me that there wasn't anything I could do.  The Auckland District Health Board was falsely reporting information to the ACC in order to collect goverment funding for holding hostages and they don't need to keep true or accurate records about people, at all.  Well then.  There we go.  Not a health system at all, hey.  That's the quality or value of the ACC information.  So we are left with what?  The Governmetn says that they pay various agencies.... The Universities and the Health Boards.  And the Universities and the Health Boards are supposed to use the money they get from teh government to pay their workers.  But they won't pay their workers.  They won't.  And they keep reporting false information about how many students they have, how many patients they have, what degrees they are enrolled in, what conditions they have.  They also report falsely about how many people are on payroll to work as doctors or nurses or teachers or lecturers or whatever.  Now...  Is the government actually handing over the amounts they say such that the corruption is in the executive.  The corruption is in the Univeristies or the District Health Boards?  Or is the corruption at least in part in the Governmetn where they don't hand over the amounts they publically say they are going to and in exhcange for the scummy scam they turn a blind eye (at the very very least) to the fact that the Universities and hospitals are keeping false records about patients and students and lecturers and tutors and teachers and doctors and nurses and sterile supply technicians and so on.
                                </p>

                                <p>Corruption...
                                </p>

                                  </div>


                                <p>__Corruption in the courts of New Zealand??__
                                </p>

                                <p>Scheduled hearing of the Social Security Tribunal today.  The Ministry of Social Development brings along two people, one of whom is a lawyer, to articulate their case.  The Tribunal appears to be comprised of one person and an observer.  Once I point out that it is looking a lot like 3 against 1 or 4 against 1 while the courts repeatedly refuse to appoint a legal aid lawyer or amicus and while the solicitor and attorney general refuse to forward my evidence in to Crown Law so that they can prosecute New Zealand Universities under the crimes act for keeping false enrolment records and false transcripts (e.g., recording that people have failed programmes of study when the student protested them keeping false enrolment records or objected to being demanded to reenrol and reenrol and reenrol and reenrol for more and more and more government money to be paid to the universities for keeping the students as hostages, effectively).
                                </p>

                                <p>Apparently it is in the news, yet again, about all these high paying jobs that they keep advertising, keep advertising, keep advertising, keep advertising.  So as to collect up more and more and more and more information about and from the people applying so they can decline the application and decline the application so the people can watch how they refuse to hire them and then readvertise the job the very next day.  It is just an abusive process is all it is or seems to be.  The way that they advertise rental properties.  Also.  Right?  Advertise a place that seems okay in order to collect up information about people who are interested in living there.  Then, I don't know, sell their data or simply give their data away.  So you waste all these people's time they apply for housing and they apply for employment and it's all just designed to  burn them out is all it is.  The people who were thrown to the Nazis.  They weren't thrown to the Nazis.  Didn't  you know?  They voluntarily chose to burn themselves out. They gave up.  Yeah.  Right.  That's what they did.  Of course.  THey were asking for it.  It was their own damned fault for being so lazy and incompetent.  Of course.
                                </p>

                                <p>They say that our graduates are basically the lowest paid in the world.  They say that most of them went overseas all voluntary-like.  Sure.  Of course they did.  They vanished.  Right?  Must have gone overseas.  Yeah.  Right.  They aren't around here anymore.  That's what we know for sure.  THey vanished.  Hey.  Right about when it was time to pay them.  They up and went away.  
                                </p>

                                <p>We don't have any medical doctors.  How can you explain that?  Where did they all go, then?  Are they being held in the prisons?  No room for rapists and murderers (doing the government's bidding to keep the people in-line.  I mean, the whole point of arranging for people to be bullied and abused and tortured and so on is so that you can convince them that the inevitable harmful consequences of that means that they will never have anything in life.  Right?  Well, then, if that is wrong then there isn't any problem with anybody being paid by the government to do that to them, then.  Right?  Haha!!!)  I mean...  Do you actually need to get a letter of reference or recommendation saying that you are a wrongful deathbringer or a pedophile in order to get a job these days?  Is that the idea/l?  That's why Dr Leeks was hailed as the monument to Medicine that he was.  For being so very very obedient just following orders to silence the children who were being set up for a lifetime of deprivation.  So that some other people's children could..  What?  Prance about in fancy suits in 'private' law firms patting themselves on the  back for being so clever as to have made it in the private sector while the private sector only stays afloat because of all the public work that is externally contracted to it.  I mean, all the private firms on call to defend the government.  The funding that the government gives to the Universities of New Zealand in ordder for the universities to keep hostages.
                                </p>

                                <p>New Zealand does not appear to have a functioning judiciary.  Read the supreme court judgements for yourself.  Embarrassment.  Joke.  Right?  Who is embarrassed?  New Zealand pats itself on the  back for having treated the people of New Zealand so badly that they think that it is an empty threat that people will leave New Zealand for anything overseas.  The New Zealand government has set about ensuring that New Zealanders are kept as hostages or slaves.  For example, they keep going on and on and on and on and on about graduates of New Zealand Universities leaving if they have choices (why would you stay in New Zealand where they will never pay you?  Answer:  Because you have no choice.  They will never sign off on completion of your qualification.  Why?  Because then you would take your qualification and leave.  So...  They will make sure you burn yourself out (like Olivia Podmore or Mason Pendrous) first.  Right?  All burned out all voluntary-like.  They will get rid of New Zealand Universities before they will allow the graduates of the Universities to leave for overseas.  
                                </p>

                                <p>They tried to set up the Indian community.  Right?  I mean...  Instead of thinking that people from India could be assets to New Zealand.  Ghandi.  Recycling.  Technology Development.  Recycling technology and computers and coding and so on..  Instead of that.. New Zealand wanted a bunch of 'we don't know how lucky we are we aren't in the slums of Mumbai anymore'.  Was happy to take laundered money and in return planned (intentionally planned) to take more and more and more and more money for enrolment and more and more and more money for answers to test questions and more and more and more money for graduation.  And then no meaningful job.  Hey.  It is a strange thing when New Zealand appointed and approved community leaders for New Zealand..  Let's see...  One is working for Pharmacy at Auckland while the other is working in Education to help people migrate their children from India to New Zealand.  Encouraging the house prices in the Grammar Zone, I suppose.  Not informing about the private rural priority entry pathway to Medicine in the name of 'equity' with cheaper house prices in Cambridge (for example) and Dunedin.  But their son graduates from Engineering at Massey.  At least, there is a family photo of everybody being dressed up.  But then something something and he develops schizophrenia at a later age in life than usual.  But at the point when it is time for him to be employed and paid as the return on their investment.  Right?  The kind or sort of investment they were selling to how many immigrants from India to New Zealand?  So then it's time for him to be imprisoned.  Apparently.  Wow.  We are supposed to be believe our prisons are full of the likes of Junior doctors (or impersonators who they no longer want to payroll) and recent engineering graduates, now.  And Brian Tamaki.  Of course.  And no room for wrongful deathbringers or sexual offenders who get home detention and references so they can go on to be lauded as monuments of people (the only people?) who the government will payroll.
                                </p>

                                <p>Look at the numbers.  Yes, I mean auditing the accounts.  Look at their records and how their records do not add up.  Look at the number of applications that they received for enrolment.  Each application will be accompanied by a research proposal.  Then look at how many studnets they are billing for or invoicing for.  They are double-billing or double invoicing for students.  Making them take 2x the time by re-enrolling them in programmes they never applied to.  Withholding qualifications while they fiddle the books.  It could not be any f*cking clearer.  Forget about the average salary for a minute (I know that is low low low how low can we go how can we go lower than lower than lower than low)?  I'll tell you how we can go lower than low.  How many of them were bullied out or away altogteher?  How many were put on a ship and then the ship was set on fire off-shore.  The cattle being exported.  The 'recent graduates' sunk with the live cows.  Right?  The ones remaining (on little to no salary) don't know how lucky they are that they weren't sank on their way off to some 'job offer' overseas.  Right?  
                                </p>

                                <p>They intentionally limit the number of studnets doing certain programmes while continually and constantly crying that we don't have anybody to work in those fields.  For example, Medicine.  Right?  They go on and on and on and on and on trying to create or drum up as much enthusiasm or motivation or desire in people to do that as they possibly can.  Our only television show is all centred around medicine ffs.  Trying to get as many people as possible to think that if they try and get to do medicine then maybe they will end up with a career.  Maybe.  Teaching isn't attractive.  They see how unhappy and unhealthy their teachers are.  They see how miserable things are in teh schools.  They see how the job involves selling the answers to certain kids or whatever.  Why would anybody want to be a teacher in New Zealand?  Medicine medicine.  Then the same story at University.  Everybody wants to do medicine.  Right?  All the health science first years.  Everybody wants to do medicine.  People don't want to do pharmacy or optometry or physio.  They are just people who failed to do medicine.  Medicine is the top.  The peak.  The hierarchy.  Why?  To create and cause as much jealousy and hatred in people as they can muster against those who do medicine.  So then some people are picked out to do it.  And they can't really complain about their lot in life.  Right?  Because of how everybody else hates everything it is that medicine has come to stand for or represent.  Thanks to the marketing or advertising campaign that went on with the television show and then the messages from teh university about how everybody wants to everybody wants to everybody wants to it's sooooo competitive.  The world as they want it to be.
                                </p>

                                <p>So Otago refused to graduate 1/3 of the class.  Refused to accept the overseas sign off.  That's what they do with PhD and other graduate research too.  Anything wehre you need to get some final sign off.  Some last assignment or something.  Any f*cking excuse or reason to withhold graduation.  Demand more and more and more and more and more money.  Give us more money.  No graduation for you.  You need to reenrol for one more year.  Just keep paying us for one more year.  Just another year.  Just never stop paying never stop paying never stop paying the university.  
                                </p>

                                <p>So they say that junior doctors are paid however much.  HOw many?  How many junior doctors are presently employed as junior doctors (house officers.  First year.  Second year.)  How many are employed.  I want their names and registration numbers (or whatever it is that tells you they are first year post-grads and then second year post-grads).  What's that?  People who graduated 5++  years ago are still employed as first year postgrads because otherwise...  Otherwise...  They would have  been 'burned out' right?  Would have voluntarily quit the field entirely.  Would have fled overseas so they did not end up imprisoned in New Zealand?  Is that how it goes?  If they speak out about it then what happens?  They say that they were frauds or hoaxes and their studnet records vanish and they say that they were never enrolled.  Is that the idea?  
                                </p>

                                <p>Trying to get a handle on how it is that we don't have any medical doctors in our hospitals.
                                </p>

                                <p>We won't enrol them.  But even if we did we wouldn't progress them through the training.  But even if we did we wouldn't graduate them.  But even if we did we don't actually publiclly advertise any jobs.  But even if we did we wouldn't actually hire anybody to fill the position.  But even if we did we wouldnt' actually pay them.  You see.  Awwwww you burned yourself out all voluntary-like.  Voluntarily walked yourself onto the boat or ship to go overseas...  If you go overseas they arrange for a landing party to meet you on the foreign shores. For example, if you try and go to Western Australia Harlene has been sent in advance to ensure the New Zealanders are kicked back to where they are regarded as property of...  Well, somebodies slave.  Right?  If you try and go to Canberra there's Kim Sterelny and family and company.  And so on.  
                                </p>

                                <p>What supreme court of New Zealand?  I mean...  Nobody can actually read the judgment they gave to me and think that we have a functioning supreme court.  Right?  Their whole attitude is 'and what are you going to do about it  you and whose army'  That is what they choose to present to the world.  That attitude.  They don't seem at all interested in teh slightest in doing their f*cking job.  The job for which they are paid.  They are paid how much money again?  To wrongfully imprison and arrange for the abuse of and so on and so forth.  No?  Evidence to the contrary??
                                </p>

                                <p>I mean, holy f*ck.  You tell New Zealand (again and again and again and again and again) to stop with the live cattle exports.  THey treat the *people* like cattle,  you see.  The only way to get it through the thick skulls is to sink the boats exporting them until they comprehend that it it no longer feasible or sustainable or an option for them to march the people onto the boats all voluntary-like.  I mean, what are they doing?  Drowning thousands of New Zealand graduates when it comes time for them to pay them.  Pulling Justices out of retirement putting them back on hundreds of thousands of dollars per year pay rolls while they march graduates of New Zealand universities off to their deaths.  All voluntariliy choosing to burn themselves out and not obtaining (not wanting) any employement in the field they applied to be enrolled in.  Worst f*cking cases the f*cking imbicels in power decided what degree was right for various people and then decided that actually the only reason why tehy decided that degree was right for you was because they knew it was obsolete before they decided that it was for you.  That's precisely why they decided.  Why doesnt' New Zealadn have competent doctors and teachers and electricians and so on and so on and so on.  They will not train them.  They are too  busy trying to kill them and get them to all voluntarily kill themselves they aren't going to  teach them anything.  The goverment never would have employed them as teachers if it hadn't have documented clearly enogh to itself that they were wrongful deathbringers first.  What a f*cking farce.
                                </p>

                                <p>New Zealand has always relied on playing dumb for international audience.  Pretends to be a bit simple but kind and trying to be helpful it is just that things go badly because people have been a little brain damaged through no fault of their own must be something in the infant formula, or something.  But that's not actually how it is.  There is another side and it is nasty and it is evil through and through.  People who are very very entrenched in and committed to the fact that they have done atrocities to get by and they will be damned if they sign off on anybody else who isn't comparably implicated.
                                </p>

                                <p>They have chosen to committing themselves to a world where psychopathy is the only game in town because everybody else has been exterminated (all voluntary-like).  LIke how Olivia Podmore just voluntarily chose to up and kill herself right about when people seemed about willing to start to listen to some of the things that she might have to say about what was really going on within Cycling New Zealand.  And Dr leeks and the Doctor who killed Amber Herst voluntarily killed themselves.  Yeah, right.  I guess the  best you can think of to say is that they were given new identities to start over someplace else.  That's how Professor Glue gets to be head of the Glue factory.  Right?  He was given a new identity.  Witness protection?  No...  The opposite.  They said 'here is your new life.  You will be called Professor Glue and you will be head of psychological medicine at Otago and you will tranquilise and drug anybody who doesn't just looooove being pinmped out for the tourists and so on else arrange for them to be suicided all voluntary like'.  I suppose that is the situation or idea.  I guess that would make the best sense of the situation that we have here, in New Zealand.  Why it is that nobody else is allowed to do psychological medicine.  But the likes of Dr Leeks and Professor Glue.  And the guy he voluntarily chose to sign off on to do Psychiatry at Auckland.  The guy who was doing obgyn in Spain.  Until he voluntarily decides to flee to be head of psychiatry (hand picked by glue) at Auckland?  So they can manufacture and feed people LSD and other hallucinagens.  So they can take girls who claim to have been raped when they were living in Univerity residnetial  halls and institutionalise and drug them and then deport them and not allow them to graduate from their 5 year double degree.  Right?  Arrange for them to be deported on health grounds when it is time for them to graduate from their training.  No paycheck for them, hey.  They just gave up all voluntary like.  They don't know how lucky they are!  Boats of cattle go down in the ocean all the f*cking time.
                                </p>

                                <p>Because the problem is that there aren't enough people.  There aren't enough people.  We need to breed more breed more breed more.  Then, when it's time for them to be paid they can voluntarily kill themselves and the new ones too young to be paid can do all the work until it's time for them to be declared  burned out when they can be suicided all voluntary like to be replaced by new students who pay the university pay the university they don't know how lucky they are that they are still here!!!!!  Maybe they really make it in life and get a job offer from overseas.   Yeah, right.  Happy sails.
                                </p>

                                <p>I mean...  People go to NZ from South Africa to arrange for their wife to be dumped at Hillmorton (notoriously one of the worst psychiatric hospitals).  From *South Africa*.  Let me ask you:  Does it seem that New Zealand is more corrupt than South Africa?  Why yes.  It does seem that way.  Other countries might have been developing in more recent years.  New Zealand has gone backwards only.
                                </p>

                                <p>The 'Education and Training' system of New Zealand is when one year of kids is initiated into the schooling system by being beaten and bullied and abused by all the other kids.  And the ones who don't kill themselves all voluntary in their first year are repaid with a little something something getting to inflict the same abuses on the kids who enter in one year behind.  That's the system of training, right there.
                                </p>

                                <p>But...  Why wouldn't you inflict *worse* abuses on the ones  behind you than were inflicted on you?  Why the hell not?  So many are abusing you and you get to target so few.  Why not direct all the abuses that come at you along to the next guy?  How many volunteering to suicide now, then?
                                </p>

                                <p>And you work so hard all year...  Keeping your head down and doing what you are told..  Grinning and bearing it...  Because of the promise off into the distant future of getting to abuse a whole year of kids.  And, well, then the world is your oyster.  More and more kids to be abused each and every year you will come into more and more of your rightful inheritance!! So you grin and bear it losing yourself in the dream that you have of getting to abuse all the other kids..
                                </p>

                                <p>But then they say that actually, they aren't going to graduate you.  Or maybe even your entire cohort.  Not enough voluntarily suicided so they are going to keep the whole  year behind.  Everybody gets to just suck it up and suffer the wrath of everybody else for just one more year.  M'kay?  Just one more year!  Don't go  burning yourself out, now!!! Just one more year, okay?
                                </p>

                                <p>But now we just want just one more year.  Okay.  Actually just keep going indefinately.  You can progress when the people 'above' you voluntariliy choose to die, themselves.  And not before.  Okay?  
                                </p>

                                <p>Who wants to play New Zealand?
                                </p>

                                <p>It is how we make sure we don't have a functioning health system, education system, judiciary.  Hells.  Nothing.  Nothing here.  Nothign to see.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.
                                </p>
        

                                <p>____Corruption at the Australian National University___
                                </p>

                                <p>I wrote to the Vice Chancellor of the University to express my concern that the Australian National University is acting in bad faith.  They had me there as a Summer Research Scholar so they could see how I worked over the summer.  They refused to write me a reference in support of PhD applications.  They accepted an application to study PhD with them.  They then provided no supervision to me.  I have documented evidence of more than 8 written talks that I gave at conferences and the like and there will be little to no evidence of supervisory input in any of that.  I have a more than 100,000 word thesis document that went to my supervisor and there will be little to no evidence of supervisory input in any of that.  They did not get my work to externals.  In 2021 I wrote to my supervisor and notified him that I intended to apply again.  I would rather have credit for the work that I had done, already, rather than starting over on a new project.  But I also supplied a research proposal to him.  He refused to write me a reference in support of my application.  He refused to be a referee.  The University contacted me to say that he was refusing to be a referee so I needed to name someone else.  They did not notify me at that time that my application was incomplete.  They then declined it saying that I had not provided to them a writing sample or a research proposal.  They also stated that they do not have any willingness or ability to supervise research in the Philsophy Programme.
                                </p>

                                <p>Since they are a research university (without a graduate level teaching curriculum) it is concerning, I would have thought, that none of the people presently employed to do philosophy are willing or able to supervise research in any philsophy topic (they declared them unwilling or unable to supervise across the entire breadth of the field of philosophy).  I wrote to the Vice Chancellor to say that the University was acting in very bad faith, indeed.  I provided evidence that I had supplied a link to the writing page (containing numerous writing samples) and the ANU already had 3 writing samples on file from me for my previous applications.  The Vice Chancellor instructed me to write a new complaint to one of the Deans.  She then instructed me to write a new complaint to another of the Deans.  He then tried to inform me that he was refusing to acknowledge that he had received a formal complaint and he would not be progressing or processing it.  Rather, I needed to try again to revise and resubmit my complaint into something they may choose to acknowledge.
                                </p>

                                <p>They have had every opportunity to sort things out amicably, in house.  They refuse to do that so I inform the public so that the people may know that the Australian National University is a corrupt institution that is not being fair in how it handles applications to enroll, progressions though qualifications, and it is not being fair on choosing to bankroll various people who, according to the University, are some combination of unwilling and or unable to do the job for which they are paid (supervise students in the subject they are employed to supervise students in).  
                                </p>

                                <p>___Corruption in New Zealand Universities___
                                </p>

                                <p>These webpages document how various of the New Zealand Universities are similarly unwilling and or unable to perform their statutory functions.  The University of Otago is unwilling or unable to supply application forms to domestic adults (who are eligible to be enrolled in the programme of their choosing by statute).  The University of Auckland is throwing applications away because they say the candidate is 'ineligible' when the Education Act states that domestic adults are eligible, by Statute.  They are not following their own published algorithm for how they are supposed to select candidates when there are more eligible applicants than available places.  They choose to use their discretion to enrol teenagers, particularly, who are taught that it is sooooo competitive they must  be willing to do anything anything anything anything anything.  The University of Waikato is enrolling (and invoicing the Government for enrolments in) programmes of study that the studnet never even applied to.  They are refusing to get theses that have  been submitted for examination out to external examiners so as to prevent and prohibit timely completion so that they force reenrolment and reenrolment and reerolment in the qualification (as the Australian National Univesrity was doing with me in their PhD Programme).  I have supplied evidence of the New Zealand Universities (the branding on the New Zealand Vice Chancellor's Committee) refusing to acknowledge receipt of complaints.  They simply refuse to acknoweldge that they have received complaints and they refuse (therefore) to provide any whistleblower protections to anybody who has attempted (by their reckoning unsuccessfully) to notify the NZVCC of issues of corruption within various of the New Zealand Universities.
                                </p>

                                <p>I exhausted internal complaints resolution in each of the above cases and they chose to use their internal process to close ranks about themselves and gaslight me into believing that I had not lodged a complaint etc.  I initiated Judicial Review of Administrative Action against multiple parties (you can follow on the Judicial Review page) and the Judiciary chose to pull judges out of retirement (not proper process for appointing them) in order to try and make the cases go away.  You can see how the Supreme Court of New Zealand has ruled that none of the above are matters of public interest.  They have ordered tens of thousands of dollars of costs against me for having brought these issues before the courts.  The Judges have refused to accept evidence I have brought before them, the Judges have refused to acknowledge the half of the Education Act that confers responsibilities and duties upon the Universities and Vice Chancellor's Committee, the Judges have refused to provide teeth or consequences for the University of Auckland having acted Ultra Vires in throwing away my application to enrol in MBChB in 2018 and again in 2019 because they deemed me 'ineligible' when they did not have the power or authority to deem me, a domestic adult, to be ineligible to have applied.  They were therefore required to apply their selection algorithm to my application (enter my GPA, UMAT / UCAT score, interview score) into their rank order listing and offer me a place (or not) according to my rank order score.  The University simply refuses to do that.  They assert that they did that and my GPA was too low.  They then document how they did not follow their selection algorithm when they calculated my GPA.  They refuse, then, to enter it correctly on grounds that they don't have to because they say I am 'ineligible' but they don't have the discretion or authority to deem domestic adults ineligible for programmes they have applied to.  Apparently it is not a matter of public interest how the Universities of New Zealand go about selecting the next Dr Leeks.  Or the next Doctor who killed Amber Herd.  Or the next Doctor who writes a pathology report on the cause of death of Olivia.  Apparently none of this is in the public interest, at all.  They should be free to select teenagers who they train to do anything anything anything anything to have a place and to be progressed through their training and to be signed off from training and to be in the hospitals doing anything anything anything without supervision.  While...  Well, who exactly is on payroll to be consultant (not student) in our hospitals?  Apparently that is not information that the District Health Boards can supply under OIA because they just record in their accounts that billions go to 'external consultants'.  The level of corruption.
                                </p>


                                <p>Most of the rest of this is me saying the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.  Because they just won't listen or progress the things.  Australasia shouldn't be allowed to take foreign students because it is too corrupt, in these parts.  They don't appear to have the intention to act with honesty and integrity at all when it comes to their dealings or interactions.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                </p>

                                <p>Here is a  <a href="seminar/sterelny.pdf" target="_self"> research proposal (PDF) </a> that I supplied to Kim Sterelny on 30 October 2021.  You can see that he advised me that my having written a research proposal was 'premature'.  My application to the ANU was then declined and they say it was declined because he refused to act as a referee and they refuse to acknowledge that I had written a research proposal.  They also asserted that they declined it becuase I had not supplied a writing sample when they had 3 from me already on file from past applications and when I supplied a link to the writing page of this website that has many writing samples including numerous masters and PhD length theses and a published book chapter with OUP.  <a href="seminar/vc.pdf" target="_self"> Here is my initial complaint to the Vice Chancellor (PDF) </a>  They could have chosen to work with me in house to figure out what to do about my thesis submission that I supplied to my supervisor who is still bankrolled by the Australian National University (apparently) when he is still refusing to supervise or, failing that, he is refusing to just get the work to the external examiners, then, and allow him to do the job that he refuses to do, of saying what concrete changes need to happen over the next 6 months, say, before the student gets signed off as having completed the requirements of the PhD.  I mean, how many years of labor could it possibly take?  I mean, who the hell signed him off?? <a href="seminar/anudean.pdf" target="_self"> Here is the Australian National University simply refusing to accept my complaint</a>.  They instruct me to revise and resubmit my complaint.  They have had every opportunity to sort things out in house and they refuse.  I now post this publically so that the public can see the evidence for themselves and make up their own mind about the quality and integrity of the Australian National Univesrity (Australasias premiere research institution that apparently or allegedly according to them does not have the willingness and / or ability to supervise graduate research students) or to get graduate research studnets work out to external examiners for external examination if the people on payroll to supervise graduate research students are too stupid or too lazy or too psychopathic to do their job.  The job for which they are paid.
                                </p>


                                <p>I have documented on the writing page academic research work that I have done while enrolled at the University of Waikato and the Australian National University.  They refuse to acknowledge much of the work that I have done.  THey refuse to provide supervision to their research students.  The University gets money from the government for keeping the student enrolled and the University refuses to employ people willing and or able to supervise research.  Where is the evidence of supervision of my research?  Where is the evidnece of supervision meetings?  Where is the evidence of concrete comments on my work?  Where is the evidence of the supervisor telling me of things like what I needed to get to them by what date in order for them to do these things?  I supplied my supervisor with research and they don't comment on it until they start throwing screaming tantrum of hissy fits that the work is not going out to externals.  They will just keep writing that I should have more and more and more and more reenrollment and reenrollment and reenrollment and reenrollment so they can collect up more and more and more and more and more money for keeping me enrolled while they refuse to acknowledge my work. 
                                </p>

                                <p>I guess I was supposed to follow them around and beg them or bribe them?  How is it supposed to go, exactly?  THey are on payroll to supervise me.  
                                </p>

                                <p>The Australian National University got a writing sample from me that was supposedly good enough for them to have me as a summer research scholar.  Professor Martin Davies refused to write me a reference towards any PhD applications but he said he would support my going back to the ANU to do a PhD there.  I gave the ANU two additional writing samples and they enrolled me in their PhD programme.  On the seminars page you can see evidence of my progressing in my academic work over 2006 and 2007.  There are powerpoint presentations and there are also, in some instances, the written talk that the powerpoint and seminar was based on.  The write-up of the talk, I mean to say.  That I presented at various conferences.  Where is the evidence of my supervisor having provided any supervisory input at all on the production of any of that research?  Where is the evidence of my supervisor having directed my readings, instructing any writings, having commented on any of the work?  Where is the evidence of supervision?  What the hell do they pay him for?
                                </p>

                                <p>My file notes record him saying that the ANU should get more and more and more and more and more money from the Australian Government to keep me enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled in the programme.  My file notes record him (and other academics in the department) saying that I nearly had a full draft and (at one point) they expected me to complete in a few months (on time).  Where is the evidence that they passed on this expectation and deadline to me so that I could ensure that I worked to it?  Where is the evidence of them doing any of the things that they were supposed to do in training me at all?
                                </p>

                                <p>Instead of doing his job training me Kim Sterelny wrote a slavery manifesto 'The Evolved Apprentice' where he writes about all the things that go into training while simultaneously refusing to supply any of those things to me.  He asked me to housesit for him several times, thought, and go away on various camping trips under the rubric of conference while refusing to do his job supervising me.  Still, the least he can do, then, is get out of the f*cking way -- right?  If he isn't going to do his job, then get out of the f*cking way. Get the work to the external examiners, then.  So the external examiners can examine the work on it's academic merits.  That is or means to say, that a person who doesn't know anything about me (doesn't know my age or my gender or how many years I've been working or who my daddy is etc etc) can examine my work on it's academic merits.  Can provide comments on things to be changed if things need to be changed.  Do the f*cking work that my supervisor refused to do, in other words.
                                </p>

                                <p>But he wouldn't even do that.
                                </p>

                                <p>Why the hell would I want to do Philosophy when it's  been overwridden by the psychopaths that he loves to write about?  There isn't any philosophy because it's been overtaken by psychopaths.  Instead of doing philosophy we get to housesit and socialise at lunch and dinner and drinks and go away diving on conferences and have conferences at fancy hotels.  Instead of doing the academic work and doing the work supervising the studnets various people are paid vast amounts of research funding to keep students enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and it's so fun to party party party party party what philosophy?  Nothing to see, people.  Nothing to see.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  Nothing at all.
                                </p>

                                <p>New Zealand constantly cry cry cry cry cry cry cry 'we don't have skilled workers'.  New Zealand won't pay anybody to train the next generation of workers.  New Zealand wont' pay anybody to get out of the f*cking way of the next generation of workers, either.  Get out of the f*cking way then, Sterelny.  Retire already.  F*cking die for all I care. What would you care if I died?  Not one jot.  Not one iota.  Why the hell would I care about you, then?  You can't even do your f*cking job.  The f*cking job for which you are paid.  Where is the evidence of your supervising me?  Where is the evidence of supervision?  If you can't do it then where is the evidence of you documenting how you are unwilling and or unable to do the job for which you are paid and recuse yourself from your position, then? Where is the evidence of your getting my work that I got you out to external examiners?  Get out of the f*cking way.
                                </p>

                                <p>New Zealand cry cry cry cry cry cry cry 'we don't have enough doctors.  We don't need more philosophy academics.  All of our Philosophy PhD graduates don't have jobs in New Zealand.  We will preferentially hire graduates of overseas Universities over New Zealanders.  We will not acknowledge our own PhD graduates.  But we have progressed and developed in our race to the bottom.  We won't get our students work out to external examiners so that they can't possibly sign off on our studnets having completed their research work now, either!  The lengths we will go to because we like to cry cry cry cry cry that we don't have any skilled workers'.

                                <p>The Statutory Law of New Zealand (Education and Training Act) states that domestic adults are eligible to be enrolled in programmes they have applied to.  The Universities have discretion to decide whether or not they believe teenagers can complete the programme and discretino to decide whether particular teenagers can complete the programme and discretion to enrol only the teenagers who they believe are able to complete the programme.  But they have no discretion at all to discuss amongst themselves and decide whether or not domestic adults are eligible.  They are required to regard domestic adults (who have attained the age of 20 years) to be eligible.  
                                </p>

                                <p>Despite this, the Universities of Auckland and Otago have seen fit to (1) say that in order for me to be eligible I was required to enroll in further study with a NZ University first (because they asserted they have the ability to disregard study completed more than 5 years ago).  (2) remove my application in early processing stages to prevent the application going before the selection committee with all the other applications.  (3) refuse to supply me with application to enrol.  In other words, the Universities of New Zealand think that they have unlimited power to pick and choose who they enrol in what programme.  They have used this unlimited power that they believe they have to fill up certain programmes (particularly Medicine and Law) with teenagers.  So they can have things like Law camp and take them camping.  Ski trips.  Then they belive they have discretion to say that they all failed to meet the requirements of the qualification (because we are keeping indentured servant or slave camps only) and therefore we refuse to graduate them.  I mean, you can hire yourself a gown and take photos.  You can photoshop in an approximation of a VC.  You can print yourself off whatever you like and hang it on the wall.  The transcripts aren't worth the paper they aren't even printed on, these days, and New Zealand (and by the seems of it Australian) Universities are not really functioning as Universities, at all.  I don't know what you need to do in order to get certain degrees?  They don't seem to be graduating.  I suppose it is so that they can get immigrants in working certain 'jobs' until they realise they aren't on payroll for working those jobs.  If they don't pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the University for re-enrolling (qualifications not acknowledged, anymore, visa taken back, go directly to prison or get out of our country).

                                <p>Dishonest people live here.  You cannot do business with New Zealand.

                                <p>The judiciary has, thus far, refused to uphold justice.  Justice Fitzgerald found (in Roe v University of Auckland) that the University did not in fact have the authority to decide eligibility criterion for domestic adults.  But she refused to supply teeth or consequences for them having misadvised me that I needed to do various other things (at considerable cost to myself) in order to get eligibilty.  She said that it did not matter whether I was eligible or not because they had authority to set selection criterion.  But in response to this the selection criterion that they set involved GPA, UMAT/UCAT, and interview score jointing determining a rank order score where places were to be offered to candidates on the  basis of their rank order scoring (with discretion to promote lower scored individuals on the basis of equity consideration for Maaori, Pacifica, disability, refugee only).  All I asked Auckland to do was enter my GPA, UMAT/UCAT, and interview score into their rank order scoring and offer me a place (or not) on the basis of my scoring.  I was not asking them to give me disability equity consideration.  I was asking them to progress the application according to their standard algorithm for selection.  In response to this the University had told me that they had done that and my rank order score was not high enough for a place.  I said I did not believe them.  They informed me of how they calculated my GPA.  They did not calculate it in accordance with their algorithm.  They took my WORST (rather than best) 120 points (by disregarding a summer school paper above stage 1) and they used a year in which I did not even complete 120 points instead of my last full time year (where my GPA was higher in years where I had higher workload).  The University said that it did not matter that they had miscalculated my GPA because I was not eligible.  But they don't get to decide eligibility.  The courts found that they do have discretion to set selection criterion when they get more applications than there are places.  But the courts failed to find that if they have set selection criterion that are in fact lawful, then they are required to actually use that selection criterion in order to select candidates.
                                </p>

                                <p>The evidnece is that the University of Auckland is corrupt as to how they are selecting studnets to enrol in MBChB.  They have had every opportunity to put right any honest errors on their part that they may have made in processing my application.  2 Deans and the Vice Chancellor were made aware of how they miscalculated my GPA and refused to offer me enrolment (or not) on the basis of my rank order score, for the reason that they said they did not have to do this because they believed they had discretion to regard any candidate who had not completed a qualification from a NZ university within the last 5 years to be 'ineligible'.  In conjunction with this information ask yourself -- who did get sent offers of enrolment in MBChB?  The answer to that is teenagers who were being selected at the end of their first year of university study around the same time as when the university was deciding on what grades they were going to give those same studnets for their first year study with that university.  They were fixing both their grades and whether or not they were being offered enrolment in MbChB at the same time, in other words.  The decisions were not made on the basis of GPA, the GPA decisions were made on the basis of who was going to be enrolled in MBChB.  The other main source of enrolments was students who were presently enrolled in a New Zealand University in their third year of a three year undergraduate Degree.  The grades those students were going to be given for their third year of study were being decided by their New Zealand Universities at around the same time as the University of Auckland was deciding who to enrol in MBChB.  That is or means to say the vast majority of the students who were offered enrolment in MBChB were not graduates of a New Zealand University, at all.  Students who were offered enrolment on the basis of their Honors Year were in similar position of their last year of full time study grades being decided at the same time as offers of enrolment in MBChB.  I mean to say the Universities are fairly obviously and clearly fixing (as in making up or doctoring) the grades.  New Zealand's shortage of doctors is doctored, in fact.  New Zealand refuses to enrol, progress, sign off on completion of training.  New Zealand also refuses to publically advertise positions, refuses to progress the applications for positions that have been advertised, refuses to pay the workers.  There's really nothing here.  Just a scummy scummy scam.                                </p>

                                <p>The University of Otago is not processing applications to enrol in MBChB properly.  They believe they have discretion to throw away applications from domestic adults in order to prioritise selection of teenagers.  They then arrange for teenagers to have internships where they are not allowed to go to the hospital and do the internship, or they refuse to acknowledge that they have been signed off as having completed it if it has been signed off.  They are refusing to graduate people who have met the requirements of the qualifications insofar as the requirements of the qualifications are actually possible to meet.  I mean to say, they make the requirements impossible for anybody to meet and they just hand out the acknowledgements to a  bunch of phoney frauds.  I guess that is the idea.  Having a PhD or a MBChB makes you a 'most desirable' person since they can throw you in prison or rescind your visa or whatever at any point in time (at the point in time when it is time for them to pay you, strangely enough, nobody would have seen that coming).

                                <p>Cry cry cry cry cry for skilled workers from overseas so that we can have them here, pretending to be working, until it's time for us to pay them and then it's time for them to go away.  There's nothing here.  No education and training system at all.  Thus far the courts of New Zealand have refused to uphold justice.  I suppose that is because the 'lawyers' needed to graduate from Law Degrees and why would we think that Law Degrees have any more quality and integrity than philosophy degrees have any more quality and integrity than medical degrees.  There's actually nothing to see, people.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  What a hokey scummy scam.  Don't get sick, y'all.  It's sooooooooo competitive.  How many people can you kill today?  That's the idea/l -- right?  What you have to do to get a reference, these days.  Oh, my.

                            <p>The Tertiary Education Commission defines a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  
                            <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a>.  The Universities and the Courts will not accept this, however.  They will not allow people to complete their work in a timely fashion.  They force extensions.  Sometimes studnets are outright bullied into not handing their work in.  Sometimes they pretend they never received work that was in fact handed in.  If you keep records of the fact that you handed the work in before the deadline then the University and the Courts both still deny it.  They will not allow people to complete their work in a timely fashion.  Because it is not an education system.  It is an unlawful slave or detention camp for endentured servants.

                            <p>The Judiciary is now imploding.  Making it obvious or apparent to everyone that there isn't a functioning Judiciary, etiher.  Read the Judgements of the Supreme Court.  Were you floored by the Judicial Reasoning as I was?  Were you motivated and inspired to learn from the Supreme Court of New Zealand what Justice looks like?  The embodiment of Justice, right there.  It is not a matter of public interest that New Zealand Universities are not processing applications to enrol, progressions through training, and qualification completions fairly (on the basis of the academic merits).  It is not a matter of public interest, apparently.  I exhausted a 3 stage internal complaints resolution with the Universities. I took it to the Ombudsman and I took it to the VC of the New Zealand Tertiary Education Commission (who likes to market at Universities New Zealand who likes to have a con-munications page 'n' iconography kinda like 'Nature') who has the statutory responsibility to uphold the quality and integrity of New Zealand University Qualifications.  And when these individuals chose to use their position to produce garbage output on how they can't see anything wrong with the Universities refusing to follow the law and also refusing to follow their own regulations the Supreme Court of New Zealand thinks that that is fine and in fact I should pay a bunch of court costs to the New Zealand Courts for the crimes (effectively) of the Universities of New Zealand.

Our highest court does not seem to have the conception of justice, at all.  It was the courts decision to delay Roe v University of Waikato proceedings until AFTER Roe v NZVCC and also until AFTER Roe v University of Auckland.  The Judge for Roe v NZVCC made all kinds of pronouncement in his judgment on the matter of Roe v University of Waikato.  That is to say instead of judging the issue he was supposed to be judging (the inaction of Chris Whelan in his capacity as CE of the NZVCC) he thought he would weigh in on whether or not I had done enough for completion of the MPhil Degree.  Clearly that is a matter of the Judge of a different case to decide!

They say that they don't have to honor the constitution because New Zealand officials did not turn up to various things and they did not consent.  I don't know why Australia would care about consent in that instance.  Did they care about the consent of the Aboriginal people of Australia?  Did they care about consent of people to be immunised or subject to medical treatments or experimentation?  If they want to change the constitution then there is a process for it to be changed.  I think it involves a vote.  But New Zealanders don't get to vote so the Australian Government clearly does not care whether or not the people of New Zealand consent.  New Zealand functions as a detention camp of Australia.  But then, Australia still seems to govern like it is a detention camp of the Northern Hemisphere, so...

                            <p>Una Jagose doesn't seem to have the job of instructing Crown Law to prosecute corruption within New Zealand Universities, or within the Judiciary (where judges refuse to accept evidence and where the supreme court punishes people for bringing injustices before the courts).  I suppose that is why they pay her more than half a million dollars to do that job.  They pay her to ensure the job is not done by anyone.  Not by her and not by anybody else.  The fact she is in the job prevents and prohibits the job being filled  by anyone with the willingness and ability to do the job.  It seems there is no evidence that they will accept that would attest to corruption.  None of the invoicing information that I provided (e.g., 0.5 EFTS = 120 points = 60 points = indefinate enrolment).

    <p>Evidence of corruption.  <a href="writing/lawsociety.pdf" target="_self">Letter from the Law Society (PDF)</a></p>

    <p> Here we have a letter from the Law Society that declares that Philip Cornege is conflicted out of representing a party when his wife (K Cornege) has been employed by opposing counsel. 

     <a href="writing/conflict.eml" target="_self">Here is a letter from me to the Court of Appeal informing them of Phillip and K Cornege being being employed by opposing counsel in certain matters of corruption to be heard in the Court of Appeal (.eml). </a>  (The file format is .eml which means it will use your browser or your email programme to open the text file).  I notified Una Jagose of the conflict on April 25 2021 at 7:24pm by email.  K Cornege responded to me as follows:  'Phillip does not act for the Commissioner of Police, but for MAP and Associates Trustee Company Limited.  There is no conflict between our respective clients, whose interests are aligned for the purposes of the High Court proceeding and appeal.  I recognise that the Court of Appeal list is somewhat confusing as to who acts for whom.' Yes.  I am confused.  K Cornege and P Cornege are on different sides of the 'v' which means they are acting on opposing sides with respect to these proceedings.  Me soooooooooooo confuuuuuuused.  Yeeeeeeees.  That must  be the problem. The response I received from the Court of Appeal was to say 'as you are not a party to this proceeding we are unable to discuss matters of party representation with you. No correspondence will be entered in to regarding it.'  That is how the Court of Appeal saw fit to respond to my concern by email on 2 October at 10:24am.  That is to say they (to the best of my knowledge) refused to look into the conflict and / or refused to do anything at all about the apparent conflict.</p>

    <p>K Cornege of Thompkins Wake also pointed out to me that the finding of P Cornege being conflicted out of representing anybody who was opposed by the University of Waikato since they had put a dollar in her pocket - was a finding that I was supposed to keep secret and not publicise.  That he sat on filings for several months only later to claim to be conflicted out was also something that I was supposed to keep secret and not publicise.  If the Law Society had seen fit to do it's job properly then I wouldn't need to publicise it becuase things would have been dealt with internally, in house.  But the Law Society brushed off my complaint / blew off my complaint.  So I now inform the public so they know what kind of people they may be dealing with.  I see that P Cornege is now claiming on his website to be employed by the Government for the abuse in state care inquiry.  I wonder if this is because they have collected up evidence of him being willing to delay proceedings and being willing to blame the complainant (e.g., construe Roe v University of Waikato as my being upset I did not get my qualification rather than an issue to do with how they are incorrectly invoicing students and how they are mishandling official thesis documents etc).
    </p>

    <p>You can see from the letter that the Law Society said I needed to pay them $50 if I wanted to take the complaint further.  I should pay for the corruption in the Law Profession.  I should pay the Law Society who is supposed to collect fees from Lawyers to uphold the integrity of the Law Profession.  I did the filings for taking the complaint further so they could take a look and see whether Philip Cornege and K Cornege were behaving appropriately as lawyers (hey, they picked them out all special like to be graduates of New Zealand Law Degrees and they picked them out all special like to be registered to practice Law in New Zealand)..  I filed that IF Mr Cornege was in fact conflicted out (as the Law Society found that he was) THEN he did not get to have a professional opinion on the mertits of the case.  That is to say, if he is conflicted out, then it is not appropriate for him to choose to delay proceedings for a couple months and then refuse to file anything other than a statement that he did not see merits in the case.  He tried to throw the case, in other words.  He was conflicted and how he chose to manage or handle the conflict was to tell me that the case was not a matter of law (not a matter of misuse of official document and incorrect invoicing of the government by keeping false records about enrolmetn and keeping false records about progression through qualification by re-enrolling a studnet in programmes they had never even applied to) and so on.  Instead, he tried to blame me for being personally upset that they did not give me the qualification.  Of course I was also personally upset but I wasn't expecting the law to do anything about personal upset.  Justice and fairness and upholding the law is supposed to be what the law is about. It is more than a little concerning that the Corneges and indeed the Supreme Court Injustices don't seem to have the conception.  Or maybe they just don't have the ability. 
    </p>


    <p>Universitites, District Health Boards, Government Departments are not being fair in the way they handle (actually mis-handle) applications.  Concrete examples.  The University of Waikato wanted to have a yakkity yak yak yak yak yak about why I had not been ranked for PhD (doctoral) scholarship in their meeting about who was going to be granted doctoral scholarships when I never applied to the doctoral programme with that University.  The Waikato District Health Board advertised a $5,000 masters research scholarship where the successful candidate was to give a talk to the DHB.  I have repeatedly asked (including under OIA) for the name of the receipient of that scholarship in 2018 because I have a strong suspicion that they did not give the funding to any actual student and instead decided to have a party party party for themselves.  They refuse to supply me with information as to when the student gave their talk to the DHB and where there masters research thesis actually is so that I can see the project that they funded with public money (yeah, right).
    </p>

    <p>New Zealand is a shit-hole (as is Australia) because the leaders won't have it any other way.  Suck up, suck up, suck up.  Everything is entirely and totally at the discretion of this, that, and the other person.  Does this person really have the power to decide on personal grounds whether this, that, or the other  happens?  Well, better do anything anything anything they say.  Just in case.  You can always say you were just following orders, right?  Wasn't me.  The singularity ordered it.  I wasn't driving that car or that drone or the tank.  It was the singularity that did it.  No people.  Nobody home.  Nothing to see.
    </p>

    <p>There is no health system. No education system.  To training system.  No functioning judiciary.  Parliament is a joke or a fraud.  I mean, c'mon, they pull a piece of paper seemingly randomly from out of a biscut tin and squabble in front of a guy sitting on a sheepskin throne who orders the sprinkers to be turned on to anybody who thinks that this ia a fucking hoax of a fraud of a farce of a situation.  We don't have medical doctors.  Too busy getting in behind the likes of Dr Leeks.  All of the money and the power and the titles for him.  Nobody else wanted to do it.  See?  No other Medical Graduates.  Nobody else got registration with the professional body or association.  There's  nothing to see.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  They are building the bomb shelters now, under the children's hospitals.  Of course.  I mean, where else would you build a bomb shelter but under the children's hospital.  No health system no education system no judiciary nothing nothing nothing at all.
    </p>

    <p>I am sick to death of all the f*cking excuses about why I don't count and why the laws don't apply to me.  Everybody is like 'you think the laws don't apply to you'.  And it's like 'I know you are but what am I?'  I mean...  What is the appropriate response or reply, here?  They think that the laws don't apply to anybody at all.  That's how they live their lives.  They just do whatever they want whenever they want because they want.  Hand out grades on non-academic grounds for whatever reasons they want, hand out applications (or withhold applications) for whatever reasons they want.  And so on.  Apparently my grades don't count because they were handed out before they really got underway with the whole grade-fixing thing (as in giving all the best grades to the teachers and administrators kids or the people who pay the most in bribes).  That's why my grades don't count.  And because it's a fucking embarrassment when you compare all the work that I've done against all the work that the people on payroll have done.  I mean, I get that when you edit a journal you get to delay receipt of publication until you have bullied the junior people into fleeing with no credit at which point you can distribute the credit to other parties.  Right?  That's how Sterelny made his career?  Right?  Being an editor of a journal being sent everybodies work for him to distribute around as he sees fit.  He sees fit to make Carl Brusse enrol in PhD x2 otherwise Carl Brusse doesn't get credit for 360 points or 3 EFTS of research work.  Right?  He doesn't acknowledge any of the work that Carl Brusse did on personal identity etc.  No.  He will give Carl Brusse some work that Carle Brusse can pass off as his own and take credit for.  Work written by Carl Brusse taking all of the things that Sterelny gave him to say and saying that only.  Right?  That's how it goes?  Progressively replace it with plagarised stuff.  That's what they like to try and teach at Auckland.  Wah wah wah Maaori can't do academics because we won't accept any work from them that is not sufficiently plagarised.  Hey, I know...  Let's write about how it's morally obligatory to uplift children and arrange for them to be abused in state care (but only if their parents aren't abusing them sufficiently at home or the schools haven't arranged for them to be sufficiently abused there).  Not exactly the developed world.  Nothing to see...  Nothing nothing nothing at all...
    </p>

    <p>So apparently NZ is going to open up immigration to old people, now.  We got the euthanasia drugs, especially.  I mean, we had the highest rates of child abuse (physical, sexual, psychological) and look how much money we made!  Look at how much money we collected from people who arranged to have their kids sent here and abused by various people, in New Zealand.  Well, the quality of our aged care institutions preceeds the opening of immigration to all the elderly people of the world.  Roll up roll up roll up for everything it is that you value!  New Zealand.  Quite the sh*t show.  Not even the teensiest bit of 'try'.  Do you see evidence of 'try'?  I don't...  I keep loooking (not doing the confirmation bias thing) but I don't see evidence of 'try'.  Do you?

    <p>Australia thinks that if New Zealand is made to look worse then Australia will look better by default.  In other words, instead of Australia focusing on improving, Australia can focus on undermining and stabotaging New Zealand.  Force New Zealand to be a costly fitness trap on the world stage, right, Sterelny?  Make Australia look positively *attractive* by way of comparison only.  
    </p>

    <p>Evidence for this is how various high-quality New Zealanders get hand-picked out (all special-like) as something along the lines for reward for their service in undermining and stabotaging New Zealand.  For example, Dr Leeks.  Most esteemed Psychiatrist.   I mean, it wasn't like anybody else wanted to do it, it wasn't like anybody else had the capacity to do it.  He was the only game in town.  He was the 'there is no alternative'.  And for all the hard work that he did pimping out the kids to...  The only church leaders who the government hadn't imprisoned, and the like...  His reward was to be shipped to Melbourne so he could continue on his offending against the people of Melbourne.  When it was time for him to be held to account for his crimes he allegedly or apparently died.  Yeah right.  Where did they ship him next?  Brisbane?  Another example:  All the work that the Sterelny's did on slavery and psychopathy.  Must  have.  All the high quality supervision they provided.  I mean, it isn't like anybody else wants to have academic careers.  Right?  It isn't like New Zealand has graduates.  It isn't like the Universities will pay graduates to work in them.  Is it 1 academic per 1,000 kids, now?  Who runs the tutorials?  The second years tutor the first years. But I think you need to pay Crimson Education (the only kind of business that can exist or subsist or persist in New Zealand) for the questions or the answers or both.  Right?  That's a model of a New Zealand start-up, right there.  Brought to you by the University of Auckland, wasn't it?  Helping them decide how they were going to fix the grades.  I am not saying that the person who pays the most money gets the places in Medicine.  It is more the hint hint wink wink nudge nudge maybe...  Just maybe...  Just maybe...  Oooooh.  How much do you want to do it?  How much will people pay?  How much did Dr Leeks pay to get to commit atrocities against the New Zealand people?  HOw much did he pay to get to commit atrocities against the Australian people?  How much did the government pay him in order to do those things?  How much does the government pay to ensure that only these kinds of people are the only game in town.  Harlene Hayes.  Quite the number that she did on the University of Otago.  you should live-stream the Ethics seminars and the Psychology Seminars and quite a few of the other Seminars.  So the people can see the kinds of seminars.  They are practically pulling out the gibbet cages.  That appears to be the function of much of it.  They get people giving seminars on how they are planning to change the laws of New Zealand so that they can do experiments on people with alzheimer's and dementia without their consent and so on and so forth.  Medical atrocities, in other words.  They get people giving seminars on how they falsely accuse people of crimes, unlawfully detain them, do not read them their Miranda Rights (torture them into speaking and false confessions, refuse to allow them lawyers etc).  These are the sorts of seminars that they have while filming the reactions or responses of the attendees.  Not a University.  Hey.  Nothing to see.  Nothing nothing nothing, at all.
    </p>

    <p>Australia thinks it funny (haha) that New Zealand functions as a back door for Australia.  It likes to think that New Zealand is a little slave or detention camp and it can pick out whomever it wants for whatever arbitrary reasons it wants and promote those people to Australia.  But look at the people who they choose to promote to Australia.  They wanted Dr Leeks.  Must have.  They wanted the Sterelny's.  They wanted Harlene Hayes.  Where is Stuart McCutcheon?  Where is Ashley Bloomfield?  He earned how many millions of dollars in their public servant roles?  How many millions of dollars?  About half a million dollars each, supposedly, or apparently.  For how many years of work?  What currency did they try and convert into?  At what point does that kind of thing undermine the currency of New Zealand?  I mean, how are the Americans supposed to think or feel about Ashley earning more than Fauci (given the exchange rate)?  How much money should have to pay to get his kids into Harvard so they can go party with Fauci's kids?  The value of the New Zealand dollar.  When the civil servants of New Zealand try and launder the money out.
    </p>

    <p>Why did Australia go all heavy-handed trying to ban the purchase of certain computer games?  I've been trying to understand.  I suppose the most likely explanation is that it creates increased or additional demand for that which has been banned.  I don't know what effect banning the game had on sales in that region and perhaps in other regions as well.  But if we do take it at face value...  They contributed to the Borderlands franchise.  Australians.  Take 2.  Australian and the USA co-operated to make Borderlands (prior to Tiny Tina, anyway).  That was considered acceptable.  Those tales.  That world-view.  Etc.  They did not have any problems with Australians buying and playing anything in the Bio-Shock Franchise.  Bio-Shock franchise (arguably) provides in-game benefits for smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol.  The Borderlands theme song is a fair representation of what that franchise has to tell the kiddies about life.  Then Australia banned We Happy Few.  Supposedly because of in-game benefits to drug-taking.  This was then, apparently, rescinded on grounds that the overall message or theme was that drug-taking was not the good, right, best thing to do.  That the overall message was not to take drugs.  But surely Australian's aren't that stupid.  Right?  I mean, the reason why they lifted the ban was the real reason for why it was banned in the first place.  Right?  Too close to home.  We Happy Few.  Too close to home, indeed.  Rimworld was also banned.  I was trying to understand why that might be.  Interesting model of psychopathic break.  Hey.  Also interesting model of people having both strengths and weaknesses and not all being the same.  Having passion for things which increases work-speed and skill-up.  Quite a lot about the entire world-view of Rimworld is interesting. A little similarly to how the Sims has been interesting for it's view of personality and needs and so on.  Anyway...  Suppose the aim was to induce psychotic breaks so that only a few people were left.  The happy few,  of course.  The happiness that people get from smug self-satisfaction of being the only game in town, the only people left standing.  There really isn't a health system, an education system, a functioning judiciary.  Not so far as I can see.  It's all designed to psychotic break as many as possible.  I have been thinking about heads on spikes and gibbet cages, more recently.  The kind of 'art' they like to have strewn about 'universities' and the like.  
    </p>

    <p>What is Harvard, anyway?  How many countries are there in the world?  If they took the kids of the wealthiest people of every country and called that a cohort then how many kids would there be?  Why would wealthy kids want to go to college at all?  Oh, for the parties, sure.  I guess they can pay to do anything anything anything to the other kids?  No?  Maybe the vauge promise of that is somehow alluring...  Where are the research ouputs of the University?  New Zealand seems to put out a beacon for the psychopaths.  I mean...  Where are the research outputs of the Universities of New Zealand?  n media output.  Instead of journals?  There is the New Zealand Medical Students Journal on high gloss paper.  But the articles are written by people with Professor titles and not (for the most part) by Medical Students.  Where are the journals for the people with Professor titles?  They are supposed to contribute to n media output only?  The con-munications from the con-munications department of the 'university'?  
    </p>

    <p>Where does the research funding go?  They cite 'privacy' -- but privacy is not supposed to be a mechanism for covering up crimes.  The 'universities' and 'hospitals' allegedly or apparently receive money from the government to pay people to do research.  THey will advertise 'student scholarships' and in return people provide to them information about research projects they would like to do or sometimes ones that will be done whether they get funding for them or not.  The people who have collected the information then ensure that the person who applied for funding does not recieve any funding at all and they appropriate their work for themselves or their own.  That is or means to say, if you apply for Masters scholarship funding they will pass off the application for funding as their own output and then not fund you.  Then they bully you into abandoning your research output which they then will pass off as their own.  How much money has the New Zealand government and the Australian Government paid to OTHER PEOPLE for all of the work outputs that I have done?  How many people on payroll to steal and misappropriate the work of others?  You can't get patients or whatever in New Zealand.  Any application for funding or any application for patient or whatever will be delayed and delayed and delayed while other people profit.  There is nothing here.  Nada.  Zip.  Zilch.  Zero.  Evidence to the contrary...  Evidence to the contrary.   I'm looking...  I'm looking...  I wasn't a greedy greedy grub needing to greedy greedy grub all the titles and honors and awards and money for myself.  I did not greedy greedy grub my way to PhD at 25 (I didn't give a shit about getting a PhD from the University of Waikato -- I wanted to learn more.  But Australasia doesn't have tertiary education institutions of learning.  They pay Sterelny to explain to me about how I'm to be kept as slave working working workign for no pay if I am not suitably incentivised to greedy greedy grubbity grub all the money then I can be kept or detained or held as slave then).  There aren't any hospitals there aren't any tertiary education places there aren't any training systems..  Just detention camps institutions of slavery up and down the land...  Will not pay the workers.  Will not process the applications.  Won't process applications for training, funding, employment.  Won't do it.  Nothing to see people.  Nothing here.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  They chose to declare WWIII.  The Governments.  Where is the evidence to the contrary?  Where is the 'try'?  
    </p>

<p>The University of Auckland wasted my f*cking time telling me (falsely, they did not have the authority to say this) that I needed to complete a new qualification from a NZ Univeristy for purposes of 'eligibility' to apply to MBChB.  I was acting on their incorrect advice when I applied to be enrolled in a 120 point MPhil with Waikato in 2018 with a 05 March start date by the application deadline.  I have evidence of someone employed by Waikato as an academic in the Philosophy Programme saying that she was willing to supervise me in that particular programme.  Of course she was.  She was employed by the University and she didn't have too many other research students.  I was the only applicant for the Philosophy Research Programme?  The Programme was not over-subscribed.  Unless, of course, the entire University does not have the capacity or willingness to do research.  It is not a Univesrity, I mean to say.  Well then, shut it down.  No more money.  Not a Univesrity.  No new enrollments.  I have evidence of working under supervision.  I mean to say, I regularly sent work and got emailed responses like 'I'm going away on holiday next week' and 'I'm off now, for some family time'.  My 6 monthly report was not released to me until well after 6 months so I couldn't possibly fill it out until it was released to me.  It was overall 'satisfactory' -- but my supervisor said that 'extra time' would make it better and she expected me to do 'extra time'.  You mean slave-work for the University?  You mean I should be forced to work over and above and beyond the requirements of the qualification otherwise you will withhold the qualification (and even if I do the extra time you will still withhold the qualification because you don't have a university you have a slave detention camp).  I submitted my work on 14 September 2018.  They deny it.  I have receipts from the University of Otago printery for them printing and soft-binding 3x 50,000 word thesis on 13 September 2018.  I have track and trace number from courier saying they had a signature on a delivery of 2 packages (containing 3 theses) that had been shipped to Professor Kay Weaver in her capacity as Dean of the School of Research, University of Waikato.  They deny they received my thesis.  They refused to send it to externals.  They say I don't get to submit it for examination without their permission.  They say they wanted me to keep slaving for the University.  They say they will fail me outright unless I agree to 'voluntarily' withhdraw the submission.  That means to say, if I don't agree with them that I have not submitted a thesis for external examination then they are telling me they will simply record on my transcript that I failed.  This is not a university.  Where are the official documents that I submitted to the University for the purposes of external examination for the 120 point MPhil Degree only?  Where are they?  
</p>

<p>
The University invoiced me for extra-time.  The University invoiced the government for extra-time.  The Inland Revenue informs me that I was enrolled for extra-time and I have additional fees added to my Student Loan.  I did not apply to the Inland Revenue to be enrolled in that, however.  They are keeping false records about me.
</p>

<p>I did everything required to complete the 120 point MPhil qualification in the 'minimum, normal, or standard time' which is what the University of Auckland told me they required of me.  The University of Waikato did not do anything they were required to do.  They refused to get my thesis out to external examiners and they refused to base the outcome of examination on reports of external examiners.  They decided to fail me themselves before they even obtained reports of external examienrs.  They never received any reports from external examiners for my thesis submission of 14 September 2018 becuase they never sent the thesis out for external examination at all.  Where is the research output of the 'university' of Waikato?  Well, then, we will have to hire people from overseas..  We will have to hire immigrants and migrants because we don't have any graduates in New Zealand.  No New Zealanders wanted to enrol, wanted to graduate, wanted to work those jobs.  We will have to recruit from overseas  because we won't pay New Zealanders.  Will we pay the overseas migrants, then?  No..  We will say we don't acknowledge their training and qualifications and experience and we will require them to then..  What?  Slave and slave and slave to become like locals?  So, when they are locals what will happen?  Well, then they can slave and slave and slave to be slaves.  Welcome to New Zealand.  Better life.   Hey.  There are a happy few, allegedly or apparently.  The smug self satisfaction of being unlawfully hauled out of retirement to be reappointed as Judge for the High Court Proceeding of Roe vs University of Waikato.  To investigate the death of Mason Pendrous.
</p>

<p>The Univesrity of Auckland did not have authority to tell me that I needed to complete a new qualification (e.g, the 120 point MPhil) for eligibility to be enrolled in Medicine.  The Education Act proclaims me (as a domestic adult) to be eligible.  They are corrupt in how they allocate training places for Medicine.  I suppose that is because they are looking for the next Dr Leeks.  The best reason why I can think of for why Wellington needed a new childrens hospital (that they have no intention of properly staffing) is becuase the people in Wellington have seen fit to want for themselves some kind of bomb shelter infrastructure.  I can't think of a  better reason why given everything else going on in New Zealand.  Can you?  The Government has chosen to declare WWIII on the people.  There arent' any public or social services.  They won't pay the workers.  They won't advertise the jobs, they won't employ people to work those jobs.  They insist on employing people without the willingness or ability (e.g, Chris Whelan who has only worked to completely and utterly undermine the quality and integrity of New Zealand Universities by refusing to acknoweldge receipt of complaints and refusing to sort out complaints in house).  The Government has chosen to be corrupt.  So...  The crimes of the New Zealand government against the people.  It is written into the Australian Constitution that New Zealand is a State of Australia.  So then, were are the New Zealander's voting papers?  Why is it that the Australian Government refuses to process or progress or acknowledge or supply applications to New Zealanders for various things.  The Australian Government is not a developed world government.  They aren't even trying to be a Government of a free and democratic Country.  They are trying to manage a slave-colony only.</p>

<p>__CORRUPTION__

</p>

<p>
I have asked under Official Information Act request for information to know who is employed by the Auckland DHB in clinical roles.  Medical Doctors.  So, something that says, what FTE position they have.  That's 'full time equivlent' position.  How many hours they are on payroll to work.  What position they have (e.g., consultant psychiatrist).  How much money is associated with that position for that FTE that they are working.  A list, please.  So we can see who the individuals are who are actually being paid to work in the hospitals in clinical roles.  The response I get from them is something along the lines of 'duuuuuuh we no understand-y your question' and, of course, they refuse to supply the information.</p>

<p>
I am sure that you could do the same for all of the other executive government positions.  Who is on payroll for how many FTE as nurses?  Teachers in the schools?  Tell us their position title.  Why?  Because... The country has been progressively gutted.  That's why.  All of the infrastructure has been progressively taken out or removed or not purchased, and nobody, really, appears to be on payroll.
 </p>

 <p>So, the laboratories at University are 'taught' by second year students.  How much do they pay them per hour?  And so on...  ALL THE WAY UP.  That is, or means to say, how many PhD graduates are there, actually, working in research and teaching jobs (how many FTE)?  They stopped graduating graduate research students...  How many years ago...  ??  Hmm...  And they get people enrolled in their 3EFT PhD for...  How many years, again?  Just taking their research and taking their research and taking their research...  While a few children of the administrators or similar) scuttle their way through to full time equivalent payroll positions where they can spend their time skiing or playing golf.  There's nothing there.  Nobody home.  Party party party.  Corruption.
</p>

<p>When the University of Otago refused to graduate 1/3 of it's medical cohort (claiming that it had discretionary power to refuse to accept that they had been signed off on completion of their workplace internship requirement)...  Those same students were (alledgedly or apparently) still going to be going on to their junior doctor positions in the hospitals.  But they weren't going to be paid junior doctor salary.  Rather, they were going to need to keep paying the university for more re-enrolment in the qualification.  While filling the junior doctor position.  So...  What happened with that?  The various DHB's up and down the country gave them registration numbers?  No?  Withheld them.  So they can't prescribe any medication, then.  They can't write any prescriptions because they won't have a registration or authorisation number to do that.  So the pharmacy can't fill the script.  Right?  So we have medical students passing themselves off as medical doctors.  No registration number.  No ability to prescribe medication.  Just get in there and have a go.  Right?  How are you going to make money to pay your medical student fees?  Maybe you can find a way to pimp your patients out?  Sell organs?  Maybe sell tickets to operations?  How much money do you think some tourist would pay to sexually abuse this, that, or the other of your patients while they are kept under general anasthetic?
</p>

<p>Where is the evidence that these things are not happening regularly, reliably, as a matter of course in NZ hospitals?  Why isn't the University of Auckland required to input my GPA (according to their published algorithm), input my UMAT / UCAT score, input my interview score, and offer me a place (or not) on the basis of my rank order score?  The search for the next Dr Leeks...  Let me guess...  Janet Frame would never have written her works of literature if she hadn't have been abused and mistreated in our hospital detention system so...  Well then, it's practically morally obligatory!!!
    </p>

    <p>Isn't it nice to know that you can appeal to the Rt Honorable Jacinda Ardern PhD to have her reconsider decisions from the executive branch of Government in New Zealand?  Don't like a decision of the executive (e.g., creative New Zealand) then you can cry cry cry to Jacinda (preferably by way of shaming the running of this country in foreign media) and then she can announce that she has chosen to make a special personal exemption out of the kindness and goodness of her heart (ooooooh most kind and benevolent and merciful leader!) to redelegate the issue to something that..   Is it Chris Hipkins Mummy?  Has some decision making power over (on entirely independent grounds, of course).  And the idea of keeping a team of, was it 4 or 5 million people in lockdown...  Well, now they are deciding to choose to use their discretion to engage in a more targeted approach.  Deciding on quite personal grounds who is specially chosen to  be excluded.  Out of the malevolence of their hearts, one can only suppose.  
    </p>

    <p>And, of course, we get rid of people by themm voluntarily choosing to stand down.  It wasn't that any kind of fair process required Ashley to stand down, for example.  Rather, he was bullied into volunteering.  That's another very distinctive Kiwi thing.  All the way up.  That's how parliament leads by example.  The aim is to bully people into volunteering.  That's what voluntary means.  When the St Johns Volunteers find you helpless on the street and they donate you to the hosptial all voluntary like so that the hospital can get ransom paid for every night they keep you detained in conditions the UN would likely regard torture...  You have been volunteered.  See how that works?   If you don't pay people (e.g., ambulance officers, firemen, teachers, lecturers, doctors, nurses, gangsters) then they have to get their money somehow.  What's that?  You pay them by the number of hostages they keep detained in conditions of torture?  Pay by the head, is it?  By the bed.  I suppose you pay flow managers to direct the streaming.  The flow of people where the government has, effectively, put a bounty on their heads...  Not a developed nation, at all.  Not even trying to be.  Evidence of try????  Evidence of try....  Evidence of try...  They can't even get a thesis and get it to external examiners.  No evidence of try.  NOthing to see.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.
    </p>

    <p>The 'University' 'Academics' can't really strike,  because they don't really do anything.  If they don't turn up to give their lectures the University can simply get a second year volunteer (if he wants to possibly pass then he will do what he's told) to play the video recording of the teaching of the lecture last year.  If they don't do grading then they can throw them up the stairs or otherwise randomly assign the grades, like they usually do, or the council can allocate grades on the basis of information like the decile score of the parents address or the deprivation of the high school last attended or the race or disability information or whatever whatever whatever.  Make sure the kids of the wealthy elite take up their places at the head or the top of the class and make sure the kids who the government wants to keep immobilised in poverty doing anything anything anything John Key says outside a nightclub on a Friday night are required to do just that.  No?  That's not how New Zealand doesn't work?  Really?  Evidence to the contrary?
    </p>

    <p>What about the research work?  Well, they could take the research ourputs of the undergraduates and change the author's name on them so that they are attributed to..  I don't know.  SQuiggley himself.  Say.  What is the student going to do about that?  Nothing if they want any possibility of passing at all.  I would say.
    </p>

    <p>So, then.  All of the money that was supposed to pay for Professors and so on to teach and do research at the Univesrities of New Zealand...  That doesnt' need to be spent on any Professors at all.  Don't need professors anymore than you need medical consultants or nurses or anything anything anything at all.  Hey.  Perhaps the kids can just write to Jacinda and Jacinda can decide what grades each one should get.  Assess the begging on the basis of how kind she feels today.  How benevolent or otherwise.  Totally at her discretion.  Of course.
    </p>

    <p>I mean, whoever is actually on payroll now...  THey will be good for the next 50 years.  Right?  And if they die...  Well, I'm sure that their dependents can figure how to distribute their paycheck amongst themselves so no point telling anybody they are dead.  Right?  Don't worry, they are just skiing or playing golf like the people on payroll are usually on payroll to do.  Right?  
    </p>

    <p>New Zealand.  It's not working.
    </p>

    <p>How old is Winston Peters, now?  I remember the very very very very first MMP election that New Zealand had.  Everything stopped for a couple weeks while he decided who he was going to form a government with.  And every election ever since.  Right?  I don't know why the Government doesn't imprison him.  I mean, they imprison Brian Tamaki...  Why not simply imprison Winston and simply refuse, then, to progress or process any of his legal filings?  I mean, simply order that his lawyers revise and resubmit the filings and then instruct them to bloat the filings like they instructed or allowed or encouraged the kim.com lawyers to do.  To take up a bunch of court time...  But hold Winston in detention during all of the goings on.  I am not sure why Winston does not get imprisoned by the government.  Nobody else wants to do it.  Hey.  No...  Intellectual heir.  No younger people being trained.  Trained to do what?  Do we really want anymore people doing what these people are doing?  No.  We do not.  We want for things to be better.  But then anybody with the willingness or ability to do better needs to be exterminated or shut down for making these people look like they are not the only show in town.  The there is no alternative we win by default.  If you don't like squabbling and bickering and bitching and moaning your life away then flee New Zealand, then.  So say all the governments of the world.  Busily busily conspiring for there to be no justice no health no cutlure no value no meaning nothing nohting nohting.  Nothing to see.  Nothing of any value.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  Nada zip zilch zero.  Wasteland of the garbage heap of nothing.  Nasty bruitish and short.
    </p>

    <p>ADHD AND MEDICATION
    </p>

    <p>Everybody functions better on the ADHB meds.  I mean to say, everybody functions better on the ADHB meds comparably or similarly to how everybody functions better on caffine.  I mean to say, the medication improves everybody's ability to focus or concentrate.  Briefly.  For a time.  And then you have a rebound or comedown.  For every pro there is a con.  For every high there is a low.  That kind of a thing.  So then...  Well, then, you want to take some more.  But your body adapts to it and metabolises it better.  So you need more and more and more to have that same affect.  And then the lows become lower...  And so...  It can be hard to know...  Some people can take just a little and they swear by that.  Years and years pass and they have the same dose they always had and they say that it really seems to sort them out.  Who am I to know better than them what is right or good for them?  But others do not find this to be the case.  They seek out more and more and they are more and more and more bothered when they don't get the doses they are seeking.  And then you add in to this whole situation the issue of children.  Parents (or the children) giving or selling or being bullied into handing over their doses so that other kids can have them around examination time, or for a little fun on a Friday night, or what have you.  And the situation is pretty complicated.  Needs to be assessed on a case by case basis.  What is in the best interests of the person who is supposed to be having the dose.  I mean to say.</p>

    <p>That is why there is supposed to be checks and balances so that only one person is not responsible or accountable for decision to allow the supply of or withhold.  So, a GP needs to put in a referral to a specialist.  Some GP's won't do that.  Or will only put in a referral to a specialist who will never give the patient the appointment.  Is another way of nicely refusing to refer, I suppose.  Then the specialsts are a second step.  Psychiatrist for adults.  Pediatrician for youth.  To assess whether it actually is in the patients best interests to have access to the medication.  Will they be the one taking it?  Will they take it as they are supopsed to for the reasons they are saying when they are seeking?  Or are they trafficking the doses to someone else?  Saving them up to have recreational high?  Will it be a stepping stone for them seeking higher and higher doses?  And so on. It is complicated.  
    </p>

    <p>And then you add to that...  Well...  I'm still waiting on the list of FTE positions filled.  How many consultant (that is to say fully qualified not studnets anymore) psychiatrists are there on payroll with the ADHB, say?  What do you reckon?  Do you reckon that there might be...  5?  5FTE?  Filled by maybe 10 different individuals (so each one on payroll for only 0.5FTE?)  What numbers would you think?  The answer to this, apparently, is that they list in their outgoing on their accounts 'external consultant five million' (say) without further specification as where that money goes.  I mean to say, I think that it likely is the case in fact that General Practitioners are truly unable to get specialists to see their patients in a timely fashion, in New Zealand.  But if that is the case...  I mean...  My understanding is that the point of a registration number is that that is what accompanies prescriptions.  So it is an authorisation number.  So, then, the pharmacies see who is prescribing what (and they can see if someone is prescribing a lot of morphene, say, or amphetamine medications).  But New Zealand being New Zealand I would suppose that that's how people are required to make their money.  Trafficking drugs, basically.  Writing false prescriptions, also, I would imagine.  For false patients, I mean to say.  I bet the health records are a real mess as they try and make it look like they are distributing mass amounts of amphetamine or morphene or whatever around. Corruption.  Hey.
    </p>

    <p>Try, in the public hospitals...  Try asking the person who is pretending to be a medical doctor..  Try asking them for their name, position title (e.g., consultant, registrar, undergraduate level medical student), and registration number (which, I believe, indicates whether or not they are allowed to prescribe medication).  You will mostly find them not having their photograph identification anywhere that is easily viewable by patients.  I really respect the old-school nurses who wear their identification cards on the front of their uniforms so that you can identify them as legit nurses.  But the move is more and more and more to discourage or dissuade people from doing this so that generally you really have no idea who the hell anybody is in the hospitals.  That is because..  Well..  Who the hell is in our hospitals?  Sexual offenders trafficking for 'opportunity'?  I mean, seriously?  I am trying to think of why it would be that the doctors and the nurses (and the studnet doctors and the student nurses) and so on..  Wouldn't be required to wear photograph name badges stating clearly their job title.  Are they are nursing student (in the capacity as student) or healthcare assistant (in the capacity as that)?  If they are a student then who is directly responsible for teaching or supervising them right now?  If they are a healthcare assistant then there would be clear tasks or jobs being done by them, that one would expect to be being done by them.  Who are the qualified nurses on payroll in their capacity as qualified nurse?  Same for the doctors and so on?  What we have is people not meeting eye contact and scuttling about surreptitously..  We don't appear to have hospitals.

    <p>I have no idea why Dr Sharma wants to do politics rather than practice Medicine.  But, hey, I guess Medicine is sooooooo competitive they need to restrict the number of people who are trained to practice clinical medicine and then have the few people who are trained to practice clinical medicine do something else.  Work for the Ministry like Ashley Bloomfield (who likely got paid more not to practice medicine than he ever would have bene paid to practice medicine).  Run for politics.  Sure.  I guess getting in to medical school is good training for politics.  I do understand why he would not want to be at the mercy of Jacinda Ardern's (or the Labor party's) discretion.  I don't think that any of the people of New Zealand would seriously question why he would not want to be at the mercy of Jacinda Ardern's discretion.  The people get very very mixed messages, indeed, about the scope and powers of Jacinda Ardern's discretion to do whatever she wants with complete and utter impunity.  On the one hand we hear that it isn't her personal decision and there isn't anything that she can do.  On the other hand we hear that she put in a word here or there and then, all of a sudden, the Ministry of Education is going to fund something.  It could be my imagination...  But I was fairly sure that around the time when Chris Hipkins was home for Christmas and realised he did not pack a suit for an impromptu media thing something something was said about his mother working in some high up capacity in the Ministry of Education.  Is that right?  I don't know what the role was...  If she was writing the test questions or answers or both..  If she was involved in external contract to payroll people who were to do that...  I don't know...  
    </p>

    <p>I don't know why we would think that Olivia Podmore killed herself.  That's what the Medical person said.  Right?  That it was a suicide?  I guess that's what they are required to say in order to be on Government payroll.  Right?  Was there any kind of independent investigation or report from the perspective of her being murdered by the same people who were involved in covering up the crimes of New Zealand cycling?  I mean, what seems most likely?  They wanted to shut her up?  Seems most likely to me.  Intuitively plausible...  Various other people, too.  Mason Pendrous.  Since they got Justice Toogood out of retirement for the occasion seems the Government was really really keen to have a known quantity giving them what they wanted in or with that investigation.  Payrolled him for Roe v University of Waikato, as well, hey.  Various other cases...  There was this thing about cleaners posting photographs of crimes scenes they had been called into clean up, at some point.  I would imagine the main problem there would be that it would be fairly clear, often, at an incredibly superficial level that it was not a suicide.  I wonder how many of New Zealand's suicides are really government murders.  Quite a few, I would imagine.  For all the work and energy and effort that goes into finding the next Dr Leeks and so on and so forth to be the only doctors on payroll by the New Zealand Government to work in the hospitals.  All the work and energy and effort that was directed into keeping me out, for example.  Because I am such a monster, hey.  Obviously and clearly.  Such a f*cking monster.  That's me.  Yeah, right.
    </p>

    <p>I think that part of it is that Dr Leeks is celebrated from within some segment of the Medical Profession.  Some people get pretty f*cked up ideas about what needs to happen in order for science progress to occur.  Like how with prison architect you can make a game (actually build it or design it) so that it is more financially lucrative to keep the prisoners in humane conditions where they get treatment and rehab and are kept happy.  Some people will insist on playing the game to keep them in conditions of deprivation and upset.  Some people will insist on things being punative.  They will say that it is more expensive or it is costly or whatever to keep them happy and humanely.  But that can be demonstrably shown to be garbage.  It was a function or feature of their own psychology or pathology or whatever to choose to keep them poorly at great cost to everyone and everything.  Now, I'm not saying that prison architect (the video game) was actually designed to be like that.  I am saying that it would be possible to design a game that was like that.  And then see how various people choose to play it.  I think that people would likely agree (if you are honest and not just arguing for arguings sake because you don't have better things to do with your time) that quite a few people would still choose to manage or run things in a manner or way that is punative.  They like to be punative.  They enjoy misusing or abusing power in order to keep others in punative conditions if they can get away with it.  Of course some people may do that in a video game (that doesn't actually involve real people) and not in real life.  But I do think that many people would also do this in real life if they thought they could get away with it.
    </p>

    <p>The medical community also has all these ideas or ideals about how poorly and deprived and inhumanely we need to keep people in order for there to be medical or scientific progress.  They say that the very very best science is inhumane and so on.  That's something they think it intrinsic or essential to science.  Like how keeping people cheaply is deprivation inducing and inhumane scientific progress is deprivation inducing and inhumane.
    </p>

    <p>Harry Harlow...  To study the nature of love...  Designed devices like the 'rape rack' and so on.  He wanted to learn about love, allegedly or apparently.  So he kept primates in conditions of extreme deprivation.  New Zealand often seems to be designed as some primate research lab on homo sapiens.  The abuse in state care.  Harry Harlow's primate research laboratory rolled out for homo sapiens.  In the name of love.  In the name of scientific progress.  Deprivation inducing.  Inhumane.  Because why not if you are getting away with it.  Must be cheaper.  Right? 
    </p>

    <p>Clockwork Orange was about trying to use electrical stimulation (shocks and the like) to change people's sexual response.  The focus was supposed to be on curing people of homosexuality.  But really, the focus in the wild (for Dr Leeks, let's say) was on trying to get little boys to sexually respond to adult men (particularly).  Right?  That was what he was mostly up to.  Right?  So he could pimp them out.  Right?  Maybe because the Government wouldn't pay for anybody to do psychiatry?  Was that the thing?  So he had to make his money somehow or some way...  So how is he supposed to do that, then?  Maybe people would pay him money to take the kids out camping, or what have you.  I don't know.  
    </p>

    <p>Anyway...  They would say that he's done a lot of good, really.  I mean, transgender identification and homosexuality is more acceptable in New Zealand than in many other parts of the world.  And that's because of all the work that people like Dr Leeks did in normalising it.  Right?  As more and more and more and more and more people say 'meeeee tooooooo' the more that all the people of the world will come to realise that pedophilia and so on is a normal and acceptable and probably even desirable part of human life.  Right?  That's the idea?  That's scientific progress, right there?  No?  Evidene to the contrary??  I mean, how could it possibly be *that hard* to progress my application?
    </p>

    <p>The Australian National University...  Upon receiving my complaint the office of the VC instructed me to write a complaint for one of the Deans.  I did that.  She instructed me to write another complaint for another of the Deans.  I did that.  He says that it is not a formal complaint.  I instruct him to regard it as a formal complaint now or then (since they refuse to sort things out informally they insist on making it a formal matter).  They then deny that they have received a formal complaint and direct me to lodge another one.  Why should I have to write 4 complaints to get them to do their f*cking job?  They say I need to prove evidence of my supervisor bullying me.  I have provided to them evidence of work that I have done during my PhD candidature including evidence that administration and my supervisor recieved a 100,000 word thesis document from me.  Where is their evidence of providing supervision or of getting my work out to externals and working to fill job vacancies if they don't have anybody on staff willing and or able to do their job of supervising research candidates?  They aren't functioning as a university at all.  They are functioning as a detention facility only.  They are refusing to process or progress research work from students.  Not a univesrity at all.  What a f*cking farce.
    </p>

    <p>We haven't heard boo about or from Brian Tamaki lately.  Last we heard he was starting up a political party and Jacinda publically scoffed saying he would never get the votes.  The Government and Judiciary have demonstrated they will throw him in prison if it looks like he is getting the support of a segment of society, however, so it is interesting to know his whereabouts and wonder if  he's been suicided if he wasn't heard from him recently.  All voluntary-like, of course.  I don't think that Jacinda really thought very much if at all about how it would look to many New Zealanders for her to take an honorary Degree from Harvard.  I mean, it shows her to be completely and utterly out of touch with the graduate student community in New Zealand, and with a large segment of the undergraduate community as well, I would suppose, for whom they do everything they are supposed to do in order to graduate in a timely fashion or progress through their qualifications but they are not progressed and they are not graduated because of corruption in the public Universities of New Zealand.  I know that she thinks it's some kind of fair and just reward for all the work that she's been doing.  The work for which she is financially remunerated.  Sure.  All the honorary titles and awards for the career-woman who takes her infant along to meetings of the UN (what was supposed to happen if her infant needed or wanted attention when someone else was speaking?).  I don't understand it.  Proclaiming to the world just how willing NZ was to sell out the health of the infants.  Maybe.  I don't know.  I don't understand it.  I guess she was supposed to be sending or selling a message about how she could have allllll the things.  Everything.  Allllll the things for her.  Have a highly paid lucrative career AND have a family too.  Sure.  She should just take allllll the things so that various other people can't have the careers they have worked for or the families since they don't have enough money to do anything much other than cry cry cry cry cry cry cry abotu how the New Zealand government chooses to keep them impoverished and deprived.  Often in institutions.
    </p>

    <p>New Zealand literature...  Let's see...  In the Rubbish Bib.  I remember that one.  A short story about what it's like to grow up in New Zealand.  Literally and metaphorically, as well.  Janet Frame...  Riiiight.  When it was time to pay her to teach...  Class sizes were such that...  And she wasn't really sufficiently trained or taught or supported into the job.  Right?  Hey, teaching is soooooooooo competitive, didn't you know?  When it is time for them to pay you it is time for you to be locked up in an institution.  Look at how we keep our most celebrated artists!  What has changed since Janet Frame?  I know...  If we don't keep people in such appalling conditions of deprivation then they won't produce the arts for us.  Right?  It isn't just in order for science progress that some people must bully and abuse others and keep them poorly in conditions of deprivation. It is necessary for the arts, as well.  I mean it would be positively inhumane and inhumane of us not to keep as many people as possible as badly as possible in institutions as possible.  Not having pay checks to do jobs that we value.  What values?  What jobs?  Nothing to see, people, nothing nothing nothing at all.  ONce they finished paying Jacinda and Ashley and Chris Hipkins and his Mommy and so on and so forth there wasn't any money left.  ANd just as well in the name of science and medicine and the arts, as well.  Riiiight.  That sounds like just the thing in upside down and back to front arse about face-land.  Total sense.
    </p>

    <p>And of course it will result in technology, too.  As people work harder to build bots and so on and so forth to hack into and change and SQuigley fix and so on and so forth the government mis-information and so on.  Don't like your grades?  Change them in the online system, then.  Don't like your pay-roll?  There's a cure for that...  
    </p>

    <p>Like Amber.  Right?  She was sooooooo happpy all the drugs that Dr Glue and the Junior Doctors of the Dunedin Hospital etc etc were feeding her and her friends.  So happy.  So happy.  Anything that you want to do to them.  Right?  So happy.  So happy.  So happy to do whatever the happy few want.  Right?  No other purpose or point or function in life.  Right?  
    </p>

    <p>Auckland's Public Health Message was all 'we don't know how lucky we are  because the US does not have federal or state funded public health system AT ALL they only have private'.  Otago's was 'we don't know how lucky we are because some people live in the slums of Mumbai'.

</p>

<p>How many people were they saying they needed to hire?  1?  They got 3 applicants.  But telling only 3 people that they failed to get the job was not good enough for them.  They need to readvertise and readvertise and readvertise and readvertise and create more and more and more and more desire and demand so they can tell more and more and more and more people that they failed to get the job.  Quite the industry they are creating, there, of people spending all day applying for jobs applying for jobs applying for jobs applying for jobs so that various other people can spend all day readertising jobs and readvertising jobs anad readvertising jobs.  That's what Chris Hipkins wants to do for teaching.  Pay marketers money to advertise teaching as a desirable career.  They want to do that for medicine, too.  Pay actors money to act on Shortland Street apparently to create desire for a career where you can do anything anything anything anything create desire create desire create this situation where you pay some people to tell other people that they can't, they lose, they miss out.  Quite the strategy for, uh, what, exactly?  The how low can we go think lower think lower think lower than lower than low.  Oh yeah.  That's right...  It's got to be plausible and beleiveable that people are *volunteering* to die, in New Zealand.  It isn't that the governmetn is murdering them off when it's time for htem to  be paid.  It's that they are apoptosing all voluntary like.  I guess they want it to seem plausible that we have such high suicide rates.
</p>

<p>I guess the idea is also that people from overseas will see it and, I don't know...  Offer to slip the advertising or marketing people some money or whatever to incentivise and motivate them giving the person the job.  Maybe they will put in a visa application or something to move to New Zealand.  How much does it cost to put in a visa application?  Maybe they will pay for some time in quarantine.  How much will that cost?  Then they will say that the medical was declined or they will come up with some reason why they aren't going to pay you, after all.  Hey.  Maybe they can con you into working the job for maybe 6 months while the payroll system is being worked out...  But then the payments never go through.  Aw.  That was a costly little excursion.  Hey.  Welcome to New Zealand.  Honesty and integrity -- not.    
    </p>

    <p>
Evidence of 'try'?
    </p>

    <p>So there is this article in Nature.  I mean newsroom.  Asking if people would be okay if they learned that their lawyer had not attended classes.   You mean, would people be happy if Jacinda Ardern was on payroll to  be their lawyer and they learned that her Degree was honorary and she hadn't attended classes?  Or do you mean if they learned that so and so's grandson was off skiing or playing golf instead of attending classes but it didn't matter because he was always going to be handed a law degree because of who his granddaddy was?  I mean, it makes a difference -- right?  Oh.  You mean that the law students who are required to work full time while studying (so that their parents and siblings don't have to live out of a laundromat) who would need to commute for 2 hours both ways (in and out of south auckland, for example, or across hamilton city during peak), preferred to study at night (say), from home (say), so that they could actually get through the content.  Those ones.  You want to shame those ones into thinking that they must intrinsically be inferior because they weren't parading themselves up and down the isles of the law library distracting all the other students from their assignments because everybody knew they were going to be judge (hauled out of retirement if need be one day or gifted the degree without even reading the law books) because of who their granddaddy was?  I mean...  Would you rather your lawyer read the law books..  Or would you rather they attended class?  Would you rather they attended the first year mooting competition (where the second year students get to play judge) or would you rather they...  I don't know...  Chose to spend their time trying to attend the actual court proceedings.  Particularly of people who were Queens Counsellors since they were supposed to be shining exmemplars of competence within the legal profession?  They don't want the kids paying attention to the QC's.  They want them doing anything anything anything anything the second year's say because of who their Granddaddy is.  The corruption...  The corruption...  The corruption...  So, lawyers apparently get $150 if their client can be coaxed into signing a confession or admission of guilt.  Okay...  What do the lawyers get if their client does not sign a confession or admission of guilt -- but instead wants for things to proceed to trial?  How much does the lawyer get for everything involved in a trial?  Context.
    </p>

    <p>Squabble squabble squabble squabble squabble.  Things are too corrupt.  I mean, it isn't a matter of public interest that the Univesrities (apparently according to the judges of New Zealand) have unlimited power to give or withhold qualifications as they see fit.  That includes enrolling studnets in programmes they never applied to (collecting money from the government for false billings and keeping false transcripts etc).  I mean...  The idocy.  The blatent f*cking refusal to do any of the most basic of things that they are f*cking well supposed to do.
    </p>

    <p>I mean what is the plan?  I guess the end game here is for things to be pronounced soooooo corrupt in New Zealand that everybody in New Zealand will be imprisoned or incarcerated or kept as slave or whatever for the crime of having been born here.  And then the US or whatever will have to supply us with Harvard Graduates?  Is that the idea?  The NZ governmetn will  be forced to bankroll Harvard Graduates as Lawyers and Doctors and so on because our education system completely and utterly imploded.  Stopped graduating people from certain degrees...  How many years ago, now?  The corruption...
    </p>

    <p>Nothing there.  Nobody home.  Nothing to see. What difference does it make if you read the law books or not?  Judges no speak-y the English.  Must award costs against the person who was wronged.  To punish them for speaking up.  The UN told NZ to restrict the scope of inquiry to abuse in *state* (as in Government) care between certain years of inquiry (not current, present, ongoing) for the purpose of getting the money flowing in the right direction.  From the government to the victims in partial reparation for the crimes against the people that were done by the government.  To get that happening.  To get the judges psychologically used to awarding the costs to the victims in partial reparation for the crimes that were perpeptuated against them.  They were children.  The Government payrolled people to abuse them.  The government and judiciary still will only participate in a process of further harms and further costs against the victims.  To punish them for speaking up.  They just will not do it.  The New Zealadn Government set aside LESS reparation than other nations (USA, Australia, Canada, UK, Ireland etc etc).  AND STILL.  That wasn't enoough (to be the lowest of the lowest of the lowest of the low) instead they STILL Had to aim or act even lower than lower than lower than low.  They are insisting on STILL awarding costs against the victims.  Making the victims pay for the legal fees associated with the inquiry.  Taking the money from the pool that was supposed to be paid to the victims in reparation and.. . Well.  Taking it.  For themselves.  The Judiciary.  Like vultures.  Swooped in to steal from the pot that was supposed to pay the victims in partial reparation for the crimes and wrongs that were done against them by the government of New Zealand including the judiciary.  The judiciary still.  They are refusing to respect the scope of the inquiry.  I mean to say, they keep trying to expand the scope of the inquiry, also.  To the churches, particularly.  The UN was clear about restricting the scope to the government.  So the government would be required to spend governmetn money on reparation to victims.  The government would not be able to say 'wasn't me -- was the church.  Go get money from teh church in reparation'.  The scopeo was to be restricted to the crimes of the government.  Of course the government went about imprisoning the church leaders who did not uphold their ideals of how it was appropriate to treat the children in state care.  What was it that that psychiatrist said in that news show?  Psychiatry is only working with the lowest of the lowest of the lowest of the low.  The real degenerates only.  I guess that is why they bankroll her.  WOuld you want your psychiatrist to be supervised and signed off as okay by a supervisor like her?  New Zealand...  Doesn't work.  hey.  It's not working.  Not working at all.  The flow of money...  Where is Una Jagose?  Where are her pots of gold?  She keeping them in Bitcoin, or what?
    </p>

    <p>Do you want your Medical Doctor to be someone who Dr Leeks chose to sign off on?  Do you want your Medical Doctor to be someone who Dr Leeks chose to support to be registered with the Australasian College of Psychiatry?  I do understand that the Australians are trying to distance themselves from the New Zealand registration to practice medicine people.  But that does not change that they moved Harlene Hayes from Otago to Western Australia so she could pipeline teenagers to the likes of Dr Leeks.  Who Australia chose to hire.  I see some..  80 year old?  GP from NZ has  been found guilty of writing prescriptions when he did not have the authority to write prescriptions for certain (ADHD) medications.  What pharmacy dispenses medications to a registration number that is bogus (insofar as that particular medication is concerned)?  Doesn't make any f*cking sense.  Hey.  Is the guy going to get moved to Brisbane,  now?  To be payrolled over there?  That seems to be the precedent.  I don't see much of any different.  Do you?
    </p>

    <p>So Middlemore will be 'staffed', likely, almost exclusively, by Medical Students who the Universities refuse to sign off on as having completed their training requirements because by refusing to sign them off they get them working while they pay the university they pay the university they pay the university for the cost of their training.  While the University and the hospital both don't payroll anybody to do any teaching or any supervision.  They just collect up all the money so that people on payroll as consultants (who likely never set foot in the hospitals) can bankroll their prostitutes in high rise apartments in Sydney.  Right?  That's why it's soooooo competitive to get to do Medicine.  Everybody wants to make consultant so they can stay away from the hosptials and have whatever hookers they want in apartments in Sydney so they can party party party with all the party party drugs and all the bankroll from the New Zealand Government.  Right?  Ooooooh it's soooooooooo competitive.  Who gets to do Medicine.  Not a matter of public interest, at all.  Hey.
    </p>

    <p>Terrorism laws to be expanded...  So the New Zealand Government can have more and more powers to imprison the likes of Brian Tamaki.  So the police can closely follow and harrass and provoke into attacking yet another person.  Right?  The Government can target individuals and bully them and bully them and bully them to death.  Right?  I mean, it isn't like anybody is any different from Uffindell.  Right?  You do your time of being beaten by the kids a year ahead of you and then you get to have your fun beating the kids the year behind you.  That's our education and training system, right there.  They may as well just herd all the kids into the main auditorium and set it on fire.  I guess that is where things are heading.  Anybody who dares turn up for the graduation ceremony.  I mean, various people on bankroll (who have been for more than 40 years) think they should have for themselves another 40 years +++ of bankroll.  Just send the next generation or two or three off to the death camps.  So you can continue on in the lifestyle to which you have become accostomed.  We don't need any doctors or lawyers or whatever to graduate any time soon.  Justices Gendall and Mander and Toogood have at least another 40 years of payroll in them, each, wouldn't you say?  Dr Leeks is still going strong in Brisbane, no doubt.  And when they do die I'm sure their great great great great great grandchildren can distribute their paychecks from amongst themselves and console themselves that they didn't ever need to work for a living.  I suppose.  Their great ancestors were payrolled enough to keep the whole harem!!
    </p>

    <p>Court tomorrow.  District Court.  Shame.  I thought it was an AV conference hearing.  I was all ready to see about recording the proceedings on my computer and then uploading them to this site so that various people from all around the world could see the District Court Proceedings in New Zealand.  See if it seems possible to do business with New Zealand or whether there isn't anybody home in the Judiciary.  I was looking through all of the filings that have been done in the various High Court Proceedings.  Seeing how much taxpayer money the Governmetn has chosen to give to various firms...  Various firms...  Various firms...  While I provide more and more and more and more slavings.  I know that slaving in the US is tied to keeping records of buying and selling and trading people as property or chattels or whatever.  But what do you call the enrolment records of the slaves in New Zealand Universities?  The ones who work and work and work and work and who pay their employer and pay their employer and pay their employer.  What is it called when you pay your employer and you also work?  Pimping.  Isn't that the term?  The guy who 'looked after' the kids.  Oliver Twist or what have you.  Put them to work going and fetching him money or what have you.  Pimping.  I don't know what you call the slave children doing all of the work paying all of the money to people who...  Well, what does Squiggley do all day?  Have meetings about what Degree to enrol the students in so that it generates maximum billings for the University.  Keeping false enrolment records and refusing to accept work from studnets (demanding they pay more and more and more fees for more and more and more enrolment while providing little to no supervision or training).  What do you call that?  Corruption racket at the very least.  So, anyway...  Looking at all of the filings from various firms...  How much money in billings have I brought the Legal Profession in New Zealand?  Wowsers!!  I am quite the asset for them.  Hey!!! Hey hey!!! Best keep that one oppressed!  Keep her documenting the crimes documenting the crimes.  Hey Hey!!! Let's target her for all the crimes keep bankrolling the major firms.  Oh my, they will have to pull more and more judges out of retirement for all of her filings!! Oh my.  Quite the asset I turn out to be,  hey!! Think how much money you could get from..  I don't know..  Start chopping limbs off and sewing tehm back on only to crop off another one only to...  Wow..  So easy to get bankrolled from the New Zealnd Government.  All and only the brainless f*cking hairbrained need apply!! Of course.  We LIKE to be the slave camp detention centre we LIKE to run this country like a slave camp.  We LIKE to tell our people that they would be lucky to shelter in rubbish bins and if we hadn't have abused Janet Frame so then she never would have made the dreary art that we so love.  QUite the monument to the health system of New Zealand.  That's what we like to see!!!! Immortalising their crimes!!
    </p>

    <p>Apparently some people wrote to the Australasian College to request that they not acknowledge internships from Middlemore because it isn't possible to train students in that environment.  That's the end game, of course.  'Staff' the hospital with studnets and never acknoweldge they have completed their internship at Middlemore.  Of course.  See, they pay the university they pay the university they pay the university and it can be fun to pretend to be a doctor (don't worry, they can't prescribe anything because they aren't registered).  But the patients feel somewhat comforted that someone saw them, pretending to be doctor, and pretended to examine them before saying 'oh there's nothign I can do just go home and get better naturally, like' and we can pat ourselves on the back for having the cheapest health system ever with no doctors on payroll.  Right?  Making money from all of the students paying the university paying the university paying the university to play doctor.  And so.. . There's...  I don't know how many...  People who are registered to practice Meidcine in NZ anad Australia.  They don't want anybody else to be.  They want to be the there is no alternative where they can get millions from the government to be 'independnet consultant' and not step foot in the hospital and so on.  They have no plans to sign off on anybody else's completion of training.  The neurosurgery people wouldn't register the guy who did a neurosurgery residency in New Zealand.  Right?  They weren't going to have him on payroll in Dunedin.  He was to pay them, he was to pay them.  He was to pay them for his 'training' and he pays them for them examining him and saying that he fails and he needs to keep paying them for more and more training.  He pays them.  Until he leaves the country.  Hahahahhahahahahhahahhah there's thousands more from wherever he came from.  Serbia.  Right?

    <p>The quality and integrity of New Zealand University qualifications.  What qualifications?  What training?  What graduates?  What skilled workers?  Nothing to see...  Up and down the land...  Go to the hospital.  Bar the doors.  Set the people on fire.   Nonononononono that's  not how it's done, anymore.  We have a more targeted approach, now.  Get 'em one at a time.  Just pop them off gradually and slowly so it doesn't look like a mass anything at all.  We are supposed to beleive all our skilled graduates left for better jobs overseas.  How plausible is that really?  Put them on a boat, did they, and sink it off the coast of somewhere.  March tehm off into the quarantine facility' and set that on fire?  Any evidence of honesty or integrity at all?  Anywhere...  Anywhere???  Nothing to see, hey.  NOthing nothing nothing at all.  Party party party.  Was academics everything you dreamed it would be?  When I grow up I want to be a Sophist and find people like Socrates and put them promptly to death.  Right.  Well, then.  Check out all the f*cking winners.  Given that game of life.

    <p>I imagine the plan for middlemore is to undermine 1/3 of the Auckland cohort.  Right?  How many University of Auckland studnets are supposed to complete one of their student or training requirements at Middlemore?  But the University is proposing that they won't acknowledge that anybody who has done their internship at Middlemore has actually done their internship.  That means to say you can play doctor as much at Middlemore as you like (so long as you don't use any medical supplies, of course) just so long as you pay the university and pay the university and pay the university and pay.  I think they are doing studies on mould there.  They want to get mould from the houses and the like growing in the lungs and seeding like cancer or tuberculosis.  They will just tell people they have lung cancer and they will die and there isn't anything they can do.  Of course.  Awwwwwwwww there isn't anything we can do.  But they work so hard in killing as many people as young as they can, of course.  They wanted to work towards developing a vaccine for rheumatic fever.  Right?  That means they wanted to withhold the antibiotic treatmetn that is known to be effective so that they could see whether there efforts towards vaccine (or whether providing saline) would result in very very very many more deaths.  Hey, ho, how many people can we be funded to kill or maim today!!! Hey ho!!! We can do anything anything anything anything (just so long as it's psychopathic).  Why else be sooooooooo determined not to process an application to enrol on the basis of it's objective merits.  Wowsers.  The lengths they are willing to go...  I guess the idea/l is you have various people on payroll and they have no intention of leaving anytime in the next 40 years or so.  And they don't really give any kind of a crap at all what happens after they are forced out.  Suicide bomb the whole thing.  They don't care.  All those people registered to practice Medicine in Australasia.  Allllllllll of the money for them.  Why would they want to share by registering anybody else?  You pay them you pay them you pay them you pay them they say if you just keeeeeeep on paying them eventually they will register you and you can be one of them on payroll too.  Yeah, right.  Sure.  Where is the evidence of that, then?  You pay them you pay them you pay them you pay them you pay them you pay them you pay.  I see that.  I see that.

    <p>And they say that Dr Leeks isn't fit to stand trial and then they say that he's dead.  Yeah.  Right.</p>
