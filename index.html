                            <p>  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzDft0DZRUw  ANd of course only a pedophile would think this way!!!!!</p>

                            <p>I just, uh, so, the 'bravery of being out of range' is, insofar as I am thinking of it: All of the power and none of the responsibilty.  I mean to say that if postions of power are all of the power and none of the responsibilty then there is nothing to stop the most short ranged cognitively deficient psychopaths from simply getting in there and taking it -- because they know in advance that they will never need to face any of the negative or harmful consequences of their actions.  So nobody else (nobody with conscience, say) can ever have a change.  Because various other people will always get in there and take and take and take -- because they know in advance that there are only advantages and never consequences or responsibilities for them.  And that is why the rational and responsible will only ever choose to flee for more advanced systems of responsibilty that make it possible for them to function at all...</p>

                            <p>Sigh. Okay, let's all just pause for a minute.  At what point was I supposed to step off or step back (from the obvious trajectory of terrorist bomber)?  Um..  Was it the time when you refused to send my thesis out for external examination.. Or when you refused to calulate my GPA by standar algorithm, or something differnt again?  Oh, I'm sorry, you didn't chose to use your discrretion to advance my aducation end story...  I see..  Uh, wells...  Yeah... So...  I'm just wondering how high up that is thought to be okay...</p>

                            <p>It is intersting, isn't it?  How you can have a production intentionally designed to be 'all things to all people' such that the people need to say what, in particular, they found to be motivating and inspiring, and what they found to be repulsive.  From shows like Boston Legal (that clearly had plenty of both)...  And, of course, every other show besides...  All the candidates can wax on about what, in particular they found to be motivating and inspiring.  And what they found repulsive.  It is interesting.  The diversity of things that people will say.  Of all races, socio-economic classes etc etc etc...  The things they choose to say of themselves (sometimes).  Allow to be said (sometimes-- thinl about when that is true --in fact...</p>

                            <p>Now...  Suppose you see a job advertised by... I don't know... Something like...  "save the children".  Now, they are an international organisation.  Respected international charity.  Right?  Right?  And...  Well..  Uh.. Um..  What have they done?  What has happened under their watch?  They had some kind of a supremicy when every f*cking kid in every f*cking school was sucking their herds (TM) barley sugar while doing the 40 hour famine...  That's 'save the children'.  Right?  I'm singing now..  Saaaaave the wooooorld..  Maaaaaake it a beeeter plaaace.  For you and fo rmeeee and the entire hummman raccacccce.  Theeeeere arrreeee peeeeeeople dying.. Iffff you caaaaared enoughhhhg you'd listennn.  Riiight? ANd, uh...  Where did the money go????  I remember ads with black kids with flies in their eyes.  I mean maggot seeing flies.</p>

                            <p>And still apparenlty most of your staff are volunteers.  I mean to say people fresh out of prison without any kind of authorisation to work with children.  Right?  Correct?  Am I wrong?  When you traffick in unpaid volunteers you are picky about who gets the one on one contact time with the most vulnerable.  Who wants to work with save the children?  WHy, the ones who can't appropriately or target them unless they are most most most vulnerable, one can only supppse...  So, uh, what they paying, then, for people to save the most vulnerable children?  Why they don't need to pay anything.  There isnt' any shortage of people wanting to exploit.  IN fact, I think you can probably get theem paying and paying an payind the 'universities'.  What does a pediatrics medical degree cost from Harvard do you think?  Permission to do anything anyting anyting to all the children of the world...</p>

                            <p>Saaaaave the woooooorld.. Maaaaake it a better plaaaace. For you and for meeeeeeeeeeee and I foget the rest.  For meeeeeeeeeee. Fooooor meeeeeeeeeeee.  Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. Meeeeeeeeeeee.</p>

                            <p>I emailed Neil Quigley in 2018 to say that I was concerned that the Dean of the Research School had not sent my MPhil thesis out for external examination so as to try and prevent and prohibit the reports coming back saying my thesis had been accepted in time for me to start MBChB in 2019.  What was Quigley's response to that?  To send me a letter from in house counsel claiming that I was to be held under the zero fee scam and record my re-enrolment for more money for the 'University'.  His response resulted in Justice Toogood being re-appointed from his retirement to say that he didn't have a problem with them enrolling me in courses I never applied to etc.  And Quigley wants a Medical school?  They can't even process applications to enrol.  They can't even understand the scope of the zero fee scheme.  Completely and utterly f*cking incompetent.  Entirely.  Nobody there.  Nothing home.  Where is the research output?</p>

                            <p>https://www.amazon.com/First-USMLE-Step-Thirty-Second/dp/1264285264  Here we go people.  Just saying.  Democratisation of knowledge.  That is what that looks like.  https://www.pathoma.com/  You, too, can study Medical Student Curriculum and become empowered with the actual knowledge.  So you don't need to listen to the flow decisions of, um, uh, ur...  Um...  Uh.. Yeah...  </p>

                            <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/493231/government-questions-cost-value-of-national-s-medical-school-policy  Warwick Bagg WILL NOT CALCULATE A GPA.  Is it intellectual handicapp or something else?  The Jury is still out on that...  How old is Warwick, by the way?  He's oldler then 65 -- right?  He retired, in fact, then was  brought back in when his studnets turned out not to be as psychopathically inclined as himself.  He's got nothing to lose -- right???  Time to go Warwick, you f*cking psychopath.  Can't even calculate a GPA FFS...  Des Gorman!!! Oh my!!! He's the 'thank you for smoking' guy who works for the ACC. His rant goes like this 'there is no evidence that could attest to your condition having been caused or exacerbated by your occupational environment'.  Wow.  Working the coal mines doesn't make you more likely to have cancer.  Smoking cigaretted doesn't amke you more likely to have cancer.  Working the asbestos removal...  He's a f*cking psychopath.  None so f*cking stupid as the stupid f*cks on payroll.  Go on Auckland keep sending your students to training places in the Waikato...  So they can take all of the accreditations away...  All of the accreditations away...  F*cking psychopaths.  Like possums that stip every tree before moving on to the next one.  F*cking psychopaths...  Why should Waikato University have to prove t his and that and the other with the training?  Auckland offers NONE of that.  Tell you what..  Get the supervisors to f*cking die already.  Get out the f*cking way and allow the next generation to do things properly hey.  You f*cking well wouldn't.  Well, time to go, get out the f*cking way.  How old is Des, hey?  Time to go, Des..  Where are all the studnets that you trained?  YOu f*cking psychopath.  TIme to go, Des!!! off you go..  Hurrah!!!! No more Des!!! F*cking psychopath!!!! Couldn't even calculate a GPA 'there can be no causation without correlation and we can't proooooooooooooove causation!!!' time to go Des!  Thank you for smoking . Guess the cigarttes killed him, hey, what do you know.  Bit of bad luck that hey.</p>

                            <p>How is the Serbian born British Trained did a bunch of work in Neurosurgery for Waikato for years and years and years...  But they refused to employ him as a neurosurgeon in Dunedin, preferring to leave the position unfilled..  He was going to go back to England and sue New Zealand for not properly processing his application for employment in Dunedin, or similar...  How is that going?  Him suing them, I mean to say?  Has he decided just to cut his looses?  Write New Zealand off as a nasty little despot and you are lucky that you managed to get out alive?  That kind of a sort of a thing?  We are still trying to recruit people to get in there!  Have a go!  Off you go!  (Pay you later)...  Fake it till you have it.  Pay you never.  F*cking psychopaths.  Why don't YOU practice Medicine, Ayesha?  Or are you the one they picked out to go blackbird for nurses from Malaysia.  We can send them out to home visits by themselves and people can say that they are required to rub ointment on their penis because they don't want to do it, themself.  That's what their last intern did.  If they don't want to do it then they'll report them and they can be deported without their qualification.  HOw many complaints do you recieve from students every year, Chris Whelan?  How many complaints?  How many of them do you acknowledge as 'formally having been received by you'??  How much do they pay you to do that,  hey?</p>

                            <p>Now, we just need to stop for another minute and check in with the Judiciary that they understand the scope of what they are doing with the inquiry into abuse in state care.  Firstly, the scope of the inquiry was to be limited to STATE CARE.  Why?  Because this is the start of the inquiry.  This is the first step.  And we are STARTING with the STATE.  We are STARTING with the responsibility borne by the GOVERNMENT.  There will be later stages or steps of inquiry into the private sector (schools and churches) -- but that is for ANOTHER DAY.  FOCUS.  STATE CARE.  Surely they aren't this stupid?  Secondly, there was a date range.  Correct?  I don't remember what it was off the top of my head, but the scope of this present current inquiry (that has been delayed yet again) was to be restricted to HISTORIC abuses by the STATE.  HISTORIC.   Between certain years.  Later investigations will look into PRESENT abuses.  Maybe ones older.  Maybe ones newer.  Maybe current.  Why?  Because the point of the f*cking inquiry, is to hurry the f*cking up, already.  Every other nation has done one, already.  There is nothing new in this.  It is just NZ dragging it's f*cking heels, however many f*cking years behind.  HURRY UP, NEW ZEALAND.  HURRY UP.  HURRY UP.  It just will not do it.  The judiciary seems incapable of focusing on the scope of inquiry that was set by the UN.  They keep changing it to make it too big and unweildy so they can cry cry cry about it being too hard.  It's too hard all the abuses in the private sector.  It's too hard all the present abuses in the public sector.  It's all too hard.  What was the scope of the inquiry supposed to be?  And when was the outcome of that supposed to be delivered then?  And now it is being delayed, because it is an election year, I suppose.  Only our elected leader has been taken into US Custody and to the best of our knowledge the non-elected second in command has  been taken into Chinese Custody and is being forwarded to Europe.  There isn't anything here, hey.</p>

                            <p>Off to Europe now, Chris!!! Oh my, quite the Jet setter.  Where is Jacinda Ardern (our supposedly elected prime minister).  She announced to the graduates of Harvard that nobody would be prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus in NZ (weren't when it was a crime in the crimes act, and it isn't a crime in the crimes act anymore, apparently) and then she's off in the name of her mental health to be paid a million dollars, or something, to write a book on 'leadership' paid by Harvard.  What happened to her elected duties to NZ?  Now Chris is up and he's off to China and now he's off to Europe...  Take Chris Whelan with you.  He who refuses to acknowledge any complaints about NZ Universities in the name of upholding their quality and integrity.  F*cking psychopaths.  F*cking psychopaths.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                            <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/493126/cataract-surgery-eye-surgeons-worry-about-meeting-demand-as-more-qualify  Oh noes!!! Do you think the..  What is he?  70?  You think the 70 year old 'surgeon' who likely killed his DHB wife will come back from Sydney and help???  WHere are all the students he trained????  </p>

                            
                            <p>Ask the people on your payroll.</p>

                            <p>Note that the USA and China are not doing business in this judisdiction, anymore.  New Zealand is closed, for business.  Our politicians and business leaders are required to travel overseas to sign contracts in foreign jurisdictions.  Better start training up  your legal defense to be heard in foreign jurisdictions, then.  Since you will be accountable to them and their military, one can only suppose.  How are you going to find people acknowledged as lawyers by foreign courts who will choose to represent you?  But how can  you win, otherwise?  No more pulling judges out of retirement to claim to receive evidence that was never supplied and to refuse to accept evidence that was supplied.  But you'll never be extradited to stand trial, you think?  Turn this whole state of Australia into New Manus Island detention camp prison facility.  Do you think that China would do you the courtesy of translating your trial into English?  Why would they offer you translation services?  Why would they extend to you any courtesy that you refuse to extend to others?  Makes no f*cking sense, at all. </p>

                            <p> Don't worry, Ayesha is trying to motivate and inspire a  new lot of people to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the 'Universities' for the honor of getting to kill patients in the vague hope that if they start killing patients nobody will talk to them.  What do you have to do to get them to shut up their face-holes?  It is like the people responsible for all the delays in the abuse in state care inquiry are paid by the amount of time that they take, or something.  Alllllll the extensions for them, therefore.  The compulsory extensions for them.  More and more and more time to make things worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.  Why don't  you practice Medicine, Ayesha?  They gave you a training place and they say that you graduated.  Why don't you do your job, then?  When did Ashley Bloomfield last see a patient?  What happened last time he killed a patient, then?  It's soooooooooo competitive.  It's soooooooo competitive!!!  It's soooooo competitive not everybody gets to do it, nobody gets to do it, there's nothing there.  It's sooooooooooooo competitive!!!!!</p>

                            <p>I don't know how Amy and Sah do it!  They are supermen amongst people!  Able to work as an emergency room physician and able to work practically another full time job as a Les Mills Group Fitness Instructor Model leading high intensity training classes like Spin Cycling.  Able to be enrolled as a Medical Student while attending workplace internships while being able to work practically another full time job as a Les Mills Group Fitness Instructor Model leading group fitness classes.  I don't know how they do it!  Where they find these supermen!  Maybe want to give Amy a few more ER shifts if she's got that much energy to burn at the end of her ER day because that is not what other ER employees are saying about the reality of life as an ER physician.  She stealing the good stuff or...  What is the most likely explanation,  here?  </p>

                            <p>So...  All those people who enrol in Sport and Exercise Science qualifications...  They don't get to work as Group Fitness Instructor Models because that would consitute skilled labor, one can only suppose, and if there is one thing that we know about New Zealand it is that nobody will actually be paid to do skilled labor.  We will get the Chemistry PhD's and put them to work as marketers and...</p>

                            <p>What 'Education and Training System'?  It's soooooooo competitive there simply isn't anything there!</p>

                            <p>We really don't need to reinvent the wheel on 'best practice' and cry cry cry cry cry about  how it is alll toooooo haaaaaard.  Best practices have been developed already.  E.g., The surgical safety checklist that was origionally developed for aviation security regarding who is in the flight deck, their credentials, and the specific role they are playing in the operations today.  The check-list of what safety checks have been done.  Etc.  Our problem is that we REFUSE to follow best practice.  Consistently choosing people too stupid or pigheaded or both to do what it is that they are supposed to do.  Those who grubby grubbed their way into positions (just get in there and take it fake it until you have it and then it's yours and nobody will be able to get rid of you) say that there is no alternative to them.  No alterative to Dawkins f*cking seflish genes and the hostile competitive uncooperative prison camp detention facility that is the State of New Zealand.  So says the only one's you'd payroll.  What's that University of Auckland?  Better write another ethics paper on how targeting the children to be victims of the state is morally compulsory!  Only way to be made Professor in the garbage dump of a wasteland.  Best be writing papers for the NZ Medical Students Journal, then, Sah's a little busy reading the script for whatever relase of Balance...  Oh...  No, she's not.  She's making up her own flows now?  She's a natural!</p>

                            <p>Then what is supposed to happen?  You get given to a 65+++ GP as their 'apprentice' -- only they will never sign off on completion of training.  They will never write you a reference.  It's soooooo compeititive and there will be a job for you only over their dead body.  Did Kim Sterelny die, yet?  Oh please God, I hope so.  Then maybe someone else can get some research funding, for a change.  How many decades did the Australian National University keep Carl Brusse enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled in the doctoral programme?  Refusing to get his work out to externals so  he could be credited as having completed a thesis on personal identity, I think it was, in the first instance.  Refusing to pay him post-doctoral fellowship wages for working, then, under Sterelny.  So that Sterelny could get paid hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year...  Was he even the author of half of what was claimed to be his?  He was a journal editor, right?  So he took work from some and reattributed authorship of it to others.  So that he could be the only game in town.  The psychopaths have taken over, he would say. What training and apprenticeship system?  Is he f*cking well dead, yet?  F*cking hurry up and die you selfish f*cking prick.  Your payroll wasn't even enough for you, you greedy bastard.  Your wife's payroll, too.  What is your daughter doing, these days?  I'm sure she grew up to be a real winner, what with you setting an example of how you just get out there and take and take and take and take and take.  You big phoney fake.  You couldn't talk about your earlier work because you weren't even the author of it.  You big phoney fraud.  What's that?  You f*cked the dog you f*cking c*nt and other eloquent expressions..  So eloquent you were (yeah, right).  What education system?  *There's nothing there*.</p>

                            <p>And then he gets sick, and Amy gets to have 5 minutes of silence.  Good job!!!</p>

                            <p>Maybe send the un-elected Ayesha along with Chris Whelan to Malaysia on the next blackbirding expedition for students to enrol in nursing qualifications.  Visas tied to Calendar Girls etc.  Take Chris along with you so he can explain all the work that he does to uphold the quality and integrity of NZ University qualifications by throwing away all the complaints he receives about NZ Universities refusing to say they have  been formally lodged.</p>
                       
                       <p>Hi Souxie, NZ's 'personality' Dr (without  the Medical Degree) Born in South Africa trained in England New Zealander of the year...  Do your studnets (who work in your microbiology laboratory) have face masks, yet?  Just wondering on the infectious disease protocols that are followed by your studnets working in your labs...</p>

                       <p>Hey Souxie, congrats on your publication.  HOw much did you have to pay to get that?  I'm wondering because you previously said that you had to pay $20,000 or more to have your work considered by peer reviewers.  So I'm wondering how much money you paid or the University of Auckland paid to have your publication subjected to peer review.  Know what I find interesting?  Reading about how medical studnets aren't getting consent forms to do 'cervical examinations' where the cervical examinations sometimes involve pushing the scope or whatever device all the way up so that they can actually see the ovary!!  Oh  my!!! Hey, Souxie, what do you think the chances are, of collecting cells from the uterus and pushing them up the fallopian tubes?  WHat do you think the changes are of pushing the edometrial cells from the uterus, maybe through a hole in the wall of the fallopian tube (oops!) and so on?  What do you think the chances may be of that kind of sort of a thing.. As an actual *CAUSE* of endometriosis?  Oh my..  We would need to do a randomised double blind control trial of people who had had non or un consenting cervical exams (maybe under anasthetic for an unrelated condition) and those who didn't have..  Who wants to be in the non-control group?  OH, hey you don't get to choose!!!  F*cking psychopaths.  Hey...  Pay me later.  No worries..  You can just pay me later.</p>

                       <p>The current Vice Chancellor of the University of Auckland chose to spend tens of thousands of dollars to hire a major law firm to defend the University's right to give Medical places to people who were not ranked high enough for Medical places (according to the criterion they published for the purposes of their accountabilty).  The issue was brought to her attention (as it was brought to Stuart McCutcheons) and her response was to hire legal representation for the 'University'.  They are not properly processing applications to Medicine (also likely to other programmes).  This isn't because they hire some incompetent to do selection for $60,000 a year, or similar, it is becuase the decisions are altered at the *highest* level.  THey refuse to enter my correctly calculated GPA into their selection algorithm and state my rank order score for 2019 entry and again for 2020 entry.  They will not do it.  The Education and Training Act is clear that I (as a domestic adult) am entitled to be enrolled in the programme I applied to.  They refuse to say what my rank order score was.  THey firstly said it was 'too low' and when I asked them how that could be they informed me how they miscalculated my GPA.  I supplied a calculation of it that was within their rules and they refused to accept it.  Simply refused.  Why?  So they can keep having their fun doing unauthorised cervical examiantions on non-consenting patients and the like, one can only suppose.  F*cking psychopaths.  Not even trying to have a health system, hey.  There isn't anything there.  Not even trying.  Tens of thousands of dollars to lawyers.  New Zealand *not safe to travel.  not the developed world.  cannot do business in this jurisdication.  not even trying to be fair.  What evidence of being fair do you see?  There is nothing there.  What evidence of Canberra being fair do you see?  There is nothing there.  It wasn't all very very very very personal about me -- look at how they treated Carl Brusse.  More than a decade of re re re enrollment because Kim Sterelny is a f*cking psychopath.  Not even trying to be fair.  Now they refuse to informally sort out and also refuse to formally acknowledge a complaint that *they didn't send anybodies thesis out for external examination -- did they?*  I never attended anybody's oral defense.  How did they decide who and when to give PhD's to?  And what reason do they even have to believe that the ones they gave them to were the author of them?  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  Not even a hint of *try*.</p>

                       <p>Aw,  hey, that's okay.  You just pay me later.  I'll just wait for Sterelny to f*cking die.  Is he f*cking dead yet, then?  What is he, 75?  How much longer,  hey.  The euthanasia drugs are arriving for the death camps in Australia soon -- right?  Not to be given to the children (they 'suicide' all voluntary-like, obviously) but to the over 65's who won't get off the f*cking payroll.  Right?  I'm talking about ones who have had more than enough payroll to have paid off the mortgage on a modest family home.  Unbridled greed.  Get in there Amy!  Get in there Sah!  Go get 'em!  This is what you've been training for!!!! Off you go!!!!  What education and training system?  It's sooooooo competitive!!!! Get in their Amy!!!!! Tttttskkk ttttssk grrrrrr get in there!!! Ugh ugh ugh!!!! Rawwwwwwwr!!!! Get in there!  Of you go!  Sic 'em!!!! Goooooo!!!!!  It's soooooo competitive!!!!  What education and training system???</p>

                       <p>And now it's an election year and likely people won't vote.  They've had it up to their f*cking eyebrows and then some, with the f*cking government.  Telling them what to do.  Unlawful lockdowns.  Ruining people's livlihoods.  Gleeful expressions on their faces as the judiciary rules that while they were technically in the wrong they can do anything anything anything they like with complete and utter immunity and it is the people who must suffer the consequences and harms of the governments crimes.  Not much in the way of jobs being advertised.  Unless you want to work for the marketing con-munications of trying to make the government look good.  Put a positive spin on all the crap that falls out of their face-holes.  The garbage garbage garbage output.  WHere does the money go??  Where's the money!!!  WHere's the money!!!  Couple hundred thousand for second to Una Jagose.  I thought Una was going to retire?  ALl the work she did reappointing retired judges to not see anything wrong.  It isn't about the election.  Just business as usual from the NZ government.  Great big con.  There's nothing there.</p>

                       <p>Apparently all the doors were open to Chris and his entourage of NZ business leaders...  Even the doors to the 14 year old's rooms, Chris, even those?  I wonder if they try and tempt the 'people' who travel claiming to be 'number one citizens'.  To collect up evidence of their crimes. What kind of people they are.  How they conduct themselves when they are doing business.  All those back-room deals, right?  The casino trips?  Little walk up k road for some entertainment?  Wink wink nudge nudge. Is it like that, is it?  That's how we do business?  How we are closed for business.  No business.  I wonder how many of the business leaders will be coming  back.  YOu have have them.  Take them.  How is it possible to do business in this jurisdiction?  What business?  There's nothing here, hey.</p>

                       <p>Everyone is just imploding on each other.  It's soooooooo competitive.  Right Sterelny?  I guess you would know.  That's why they pay you hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year salary and then hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year research funding to be the only game in town.  No room for anybody else.  All of the everything for Sterelny!!  You win, Sterelny.  THere isn't any philosophy curriculum left.  Right?  That was the goal.  Right?  Turn it into second-rate science.  Yeah?  Take the university curriculum out of the university and the secondary curriculum out of secondary school.  Have the teachers working in prison camps and you can ponce about as glorious Lord!  Have your 'students' house-sitting for you and feeding your cats.  Say they are required to go away with you on camping trips oh so important for their careers!!!  F*cking psychopath.  I did want a career as an academic.  And then I met the arse-holes from ANU and I didn't want one, anymore.  Oh ho ho ho ho we didnt' think that she wanted any money!  SHe was asking for it, therefore!!  Just handed over more and more and more and more and more of her work for no-credit.  F*cking psychopaths.  It doesn't matter what people want whether you pay them fairly or not.  F*cking psychopaths.  What education and training system?  What 'universities'.  There isn't anything there.  Get in there Amy!  Get in there Sah!  Sic em!!!!</p>

                       <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/493178/teachers-shocked-at-leaked-draft-of-science-curriculum-where-s-the-physics-and-chemistry  It is 'heavy on the Philosophy'?  Excuse me?  ...  I'm sorry --  I feel your pain.  But it is important for you to know that this is not honest Philosophy Curriculum, either.  It is literally non-sense no sense.  The complete undermining of any pretence at all of an 'educational system'.  Don't get me wrong -- I understand that the 'bleeding edge' science curriculum is doing work on refocusing or orienting or whatever the science curriculum contents into teaching the standard curriculum through thematic presentation.. However..  It is uncontroversially fair to say that NZL hasn't gotten with the programme sufficiently to contribute to the bleeding edge of..  Uh.  Well, anything.  Anything.  ANything at all.  F*cking retards...  Sooooooo f*cking slooooooooooow.  Hurrrrrrry uuuuuup NZL...  Huurrrrrrry uuuuuuuuuuuuuup... </p>

                       <p>The 'University of Auckland' has a CUP programme -- Certificate of University Preparation.  Where they promise to teach all the years of secondary school curriculum to people enrolled in the CUP programme at the University.  They are too busy exercising their discretion to enrol people who aren't 20 who don't have the academic credentials to be enrolled in University Programmes in the Univesrity (moooooooore mooooneey!!!) that they don't have any time or energy left to process the applications to enrol from the 20 year + studnets who are *eilgible by statute*.  F*cking retards.  Can't do / won't do the only thing they are supposed to do.  OMG..  It's like they have been all motivated and inspired by the royal commission of inquiry on how to refuse to do any of the most basic things that the UN has directed...  Can't do.  Won't do.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                       <p>Step one:  Get with the program.  Step Two:  Do the program.  Step Three:  Transcend the programme..  Develop new program...  Oooooooh...  GET WITH THE PROGRAM NZL. HURRY UP!!! HURRY UP!!!! HURRY UP!!! WE'LL ALL HAVE BEEN EXTERMINATED BEFORE OUR ESTEEMED LEADERS ON PAYROLL DIE.  HURRY UP!!! HURRY UP!!!! HURRRY UP!!!!</p>

                       <p>The 'extension programmes' or 'extension curriculum's' on things like energy cycling and climate change...  Should be reward (funded) projects for high performers in standard curriculum contents. NZ has no right to even try and be cutting or bleeding edge when it just resolutely and determinedly fails to get with the f*cking programme, every step of the f*cking way...</p>

                       <p>You know, if only I could be a third class American.  Or a second class Australian.  My life would be so much better than it is now, in NZL.  Because it's such a f*cking dump of a waste-land so Australian and THe USA can troll for second and third class people to treat poorly..  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                       <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/300921109/the-careers-that-will-survive-the-ai-revolution--and-pay-the-highest-salary  Really...  Well, between surgery simulator (just get in there and have a go, anybody, anybody, anybody at all) and 'I'm sorry there isn't anything that I can do' and Chat GTP output (indistinguishable to most 'doctors')...  I mean, who can tell the difference between a Yoga Flow made up by Sah and a Les Mills Release number #whatever?  Can we tell the difference between trained and educated professionals and 'just get in there and take it'?  I don't think we can, can we?  What education and training sytem?  What skilled and knowledgeable professionals?  What's that, Sah?  Don't stand upside down, you say?  It's the head stands and the hand stands that cause the endometriosis.  Really?  While the medical 'professionals' are sticking them with the endoscope.  You think?  The leg postition matters?  We should experimetn with leg position while we f*ck them with the scope...  Hmmm..  Good thinking!!!  </p>
