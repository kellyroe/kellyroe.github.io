                            <p>
                            The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications.  They define a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a> 
                            </p>

                           <p>Australasian Universities believe they are entitled to simply refuse to process or progress students work, however.  Take it to court, they say.  Then the courts refuse to progress filings.   
                            </p>

                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.

                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  
                                </p> 

                            <p>
                            It seems to me that the Australian Constition explicitly states that New Zealand is regarded, by them, to be a State of the Federation of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  Australia refuses to honor it's own Constitution. 
                            </p>

                            New Zealand:  The Gamma Baby Breeding Programme.  For the Wastrels.  The Degenerate Breeding Programme.  The Detention Camp of the World.  Look at how the New Zealand Government treats the people of NZ (refuses to pay teachers so as to stabotage and undermine the public education system).  Refuses to appoint competent judges (of whatever age).  Look at how NZ treats it's people.  Look at how various other countries treat the people of NZ.  The NZ government won't even stand up for it's own people.  It sells out it's own people.  It won't pay the workers.  It won't train the workers. It won't educate the people.  Gamma baby breeding programme for degenerate wastrels.  It certainly doesn't value the health or the life of the people.  Detention camps.  The schools, hospitals..  Detention camps.  Wasting the people's time.  Wastrels.  Wastrels.  Where are my Univesrity qualifications for the Univesrity work that I did?  Where are my Degrees?  WHere is the pay for the work that I did for the Universities after they were required to have give me Degrees?  Where is justice from the courts?  Wastrel land of slaves.  Volunteers.  Bonded servants.  Wastrels.  That's how the Governmetn chooses to treat the people. Who profits from a terrorist breeding programme?  More power for the central government!  ALl of the guns for the central governmetn and no guns for the people.  The people don't need to protect htemselves against the central Government.  The central governmetn who labels them as wastrels and refuses to process their pay.  Refuses to process their filings.  Refuses to process their work.  Refuses to pay their workers.  Busy breeding people to be like cockroaches to survive nuclear strike.  Wastrel land of New Zealand.
                        </p>

                        <p>The government doesn't want doctors.  They want slaves and bonded servants.  They want people to manage and administrate the detention camps.  The hospoitals and prisons and schools.  The detention camps.  Take the organ and the samples and ship em to where they are supposed to be shippped.  Selling out the health of the people.
                        </p>

                        <p>NZ has two modes on the 'right sized'ness of things (education and work).  Either it's a detention camp.  HOme detention.  Work detention.  School detention.  Stare at the walls people.  If you move the pedophile will get you.  Else it's everything for you.  Allll the work for you.  More work than you can possibly do.  So much work that you can't possibly be held accountable for your failure to do any of it properly.  Course not.
                        </p>

                        <p>Hey, I know.  If Kelly doesn't follow the  money follow the money follow the money wanting to be rich..  Then we should withhold money and force her to do the work we would have paid her for.  Hahahhahaha f*cking serves her right (in retard-land?)  Slavery manifesto.  I remember Kim Sterelny saying to me 'yuo might want to have a think about what kind of work slaves will not do'.  Riiiight.   Because he wrote his slavery manifesto when I was his student.  I'm his little experiment in how  you can get art out of slaves.  Do you like my works of art?  Do you like the ouput of a happy philosoper being kept as slave?  Do you like the slave doctors you made in other fields?  Dr Leeks?  Dr Money?  Dr Glue?  Are they good for you?  For the heatlh of New Zealanders?  Are they teaching the next generation everything it is that we value?

                        <p>
                        Australia chose not to develop their programme to include graduate level coursework.  Australia chose not to have any breadth to the programme such that there could be a realistic requirement for graduates to demonstrate knowledge of the breadth of traditional areas of philosophy, and more besides.  They decided they would rather force people to stay and work under conditions of slavery indentured servitude or whatever.  They won't invest in training a skilled workforce.  They don't value their people enough to train them.  They would rather they die young.  I guess it's the pedophile thing.  They don't value knowledge, they value youth.  Wide-eyed in awe of how little their teachers know.

                        <p>Hey, Australia got the refugee to write a book on his cellphone!! They thought it was enough for him to be deported to the detention camp of New Zealand!!! Moving up in the world!!!  What do I get?  What does this slave get??  Have I done enough work, yet?  Have I done 2x as much as your other PhD students?  3?  More??  Would you like to voluntariliy move to Australia?  Or has Australasia, generally, decided that it wants to be a slaver nation.  Look at all the tormented unhappy distressed art.  Well done.  Can you tell the difference??  Do you like the theses I never wanted to write?  Are they good for you?
