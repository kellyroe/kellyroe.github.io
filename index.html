                            <p>In Roe v University of Waikato, Justice Toogood (who isn't supposed to be Judge at all since he's past the age of retirement) found that he could not see any problem with the University of Waikato recording that Ms Roe was enrolled in a programme of study that she had never applied to be enrolled in.  Ms Roe did not apply to be enrolled in an MPhil qualification in 2019.  And yet her IRD student loan says that she owes money for the 'University' having recorded her as being enrolled in that qualification.  Where is her application form to enrol in an MPhil programme of study for 2019?  She applied to be enrolled in a 120 point 1 EFT 34 week (including the external examination period) MPhil in 2018 and supplied them with a thesis in September of 2018.  They delayed getting the thesis out to externals (they refused).  Ms Roe got them another thesis in October of 2018.  They sent it out for external examination for the wrong qualification.  PhD rather than MPhil.  The externals required substantive changes -- but kept the thesis.  The Calendar Regulations say that when substantive changes are required but the thesis it not returned to the candidate then the changes are to be completed within 10 weeks.  Ms Roe made the changes within 10 weeks and they refused to get the thesis out to externals.  Refused to get the January 2019 thesis out to externals.  Refused to get the February 2019 thesis out to externals.  Recorded that she was re-enrolled (pay us more fees) in 2019 when she never applied to be enrolled in 2019.  She'd written them a 120 point 1 EFT 34 week thesis already.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                             https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/in-depth/491859/cash-strapped-waikato-university-has-paid-former-cabinet-minister-steven-joyce-nearly-1-million</p>

                             <p>And how much has Quigley taken for himself over how many years of mis-management?  Clearly we needed to get someone in from overseas to destroy the University.  How about Kay Weaver?  How  much did she take in her capacity as head of the school of graduate research while refusing to get theses out for external examination and refusing to allow external examiners to sign off on completion of research degree?  How much money did she take to refuse to allow the University to have research output? </p>

                             <p>The Scholarships money isn't going to the graduate research students either.  They are not providing lists of named recipients for Masters Scholarships that were supposed to be awarded on the basis of academic merit.  I think it highly likely that the money is not going to the research students at all.  Are we more corrupt than Fiji?  Yes.  Seems to.  They paid their women's rubgy players, it seems.  Finally.  After being publically shamed about it on social media.  I would have thought Waikato University wouldn't have wanted to pay tens of thousands of dollars to external counsel to have them defend their right to record student enrolment in qualifications the student never applied to.  But they don't seem to have the most basic of self-preservation instinct, at all.  They won't enrol people in the programmes they apply to.  They enrol them in programmes they never applied to.  F*cking corruption.  </p>

                             <p>How much money did they choose to spend on external counsel to assert to the courts their right to keep graduate students enrolled in programmes they never applied to.  To keep them enrolled under 'zero fee scheme'.  What 'University'?  Where is the research output?  Now, instead of Quigley getting out he's going around firing everybody else.  Like Harlene Hayes.  Restructure the restructure of the restructure.  Get people applying and reapplying and re re applying for their old jobs but with more work to do for less pay.  F*cking psychopaths.  Get out Quigley.  F*cking psychopath.  I emailed you in time to do something about it.  As I emailed Stuart McCutcheon in time to do something about it.  As I emailed the new VC of Auckland.  Emailed her in time to do something about it.  They aren't processing applications to Medicine.  Harlene wasn't processing graduations.  Refusing to allow externals to sign off on completion of internships.  So they can record them being re re re enrolled with the University paying more and more fees while they put them to work in the hospitals passing them off as Junior Doctors when they don't have registration numbers and they don't have signed consent forms and they don't have medical supplies...  There's nothing there, hey.  F*cking psychopaths.    </p>

                             <p>I'm sure the 'Junior Doctors' (who had their qualifications withheld because of corruption) are just dying to know what GP they have been chosen to be pimped out to.  Who their baby's daddy is required to be.  What 65 +++ year old 'it's probably a virus there's nothing we can do' promises to retire in 45 years.  THey won't voluntarily walk away from their pay cheques.  They won't voluntarily get out.  They aren't training a new generation.  They haven't been.  Many of them were not educated or trained very well themselves.  And they've done little to nothing to learn independently after their pay cheques started rolling in for themselves.  They won't sign off on completion of other people's training.  There will be jobs for them only over their dead bodies.  Get out Quigley.  F*cking psychopath.</p>

                             <p>If you think about the way the US Universities run...  They have 4 year Undergraduate Degrees.  Well, the Community Colleges have 3 Year Degree Programmes (I think they do call them 3 Year Degree Programmes) but they are distinct from 4 Year College Degrees.  The systems don't quite translate.  I mean to say, a 3 Year Degree from Australasia + 1 Year of Honors is still something quite different from a 4 Year College Degree in the US.  Why?  Because the 4 Year College Degrees have breadth and depth requirements.  We don't have breadth requirements on our Degrees.  I mean to say people are encouraged to specialise early.  I mean to say, you choose 3 pairs of subjects in your first year and one or two options.  Maybe chemistry or biology or psychology or English.  They encourage you to do 3 pairs of subjects so you keep options open in terms of a major or maybe even two.  So you continue on with the ones you like the most.  The options are limited.  Whereas in the US they are required to demonstrate breadth.  So everyone enrolled in any Degree is required to do a Math paper.  And everyone enrolled in any Degree is required to do an English paper.  At least 1.  Why?  Because it gives some spread to the education.  Breadth.  Helps people be able to talk to people who are doing different things.  Also it helps provide certainty with respect to student numbers.  Instead of pitting Arts against Science offer qualifications that teach people both ffs.  The whole point of a University Education is that it is supposed to be high level or general enough to not become obsolete in 5 years.  Nuclear physics really hasn't changed much, over the last 100 years or so, would you believe.  So why are we always kept so f*cking far behind?  </p>

                             <p>Then the courses come in 2 levels (only) for the undergrad Degree.  Lower level.  Requiring no pre-requisite.  Upper level.  Requiring lower level pre-requisite.  Then the distinction comes between courses that have High School pre-requisite (e.g., AP course completion) which means they are University or tertiary level courses...  Or whether they are basically AP level high school courses being offered at University.  Because why not get a bunch of money out of people for teaching them High School or Secondary Level subjects at University?  WHy not progressively turn the tertiary education into secondary education.  Hey, if all goes well we can teach primary level courses at University.  See if we can get the graduates with a reading age of 10?  We wouldn't want them reading the Australian Constitution that says NZ is the second named state of the federation of Australia.  Next they'd wnat to be paid Australian Wages and vote in the Federal Elections. </p>

                             <p>My honors year was..  I think half of it ended up being basically independent research.  Apparently it was bundled with the University of Auckland students work (since I was the only Honors student in Philosophy at Waikato that year) and sent to Otago for external examination.  That was what I was told happened, anyway.  That was how I was told I earned my GPA for my Honors Year.  But maybe that's not true.  Maybe someone took a liking to my photo and they thought giving me grades enough to go to the ANU meant I could be Sterelny's b*tch for a while.  He could take me camping and I'd housesit for him.  And he wouldn't supervise my research at all.  ANd he wouldn't get out of the way.  Wouldn't send it to externals.  Did anyone from the Australian National have their thesis go out for external examination?  Nobody had oral defence.  Nobody had external examiners come to the University and question them about their thesis to make sure that it was actually their own work, even. To check they understood it.  My work never went out to externals.  It's not personal, though.  That was the case for other students, too.  For how many years was Carl Brusse supposed to go camping with Kim and housesit for him?  Have morning tea and afternoon tea?  Go to university to eat your lunch?  What supervision?  Apparently I'm supposed to prove there wasn't any...  That's what the Australian National University has to say about it, now.  I can't prooooooove that he didn't supervise me.  Well, check his email outbox, then, for evidence of supervision.  Check his email outbox for requests for meetings.  For comments on written work that I sent him.  For any comments at all after he received my 100,000 ++++ doctoral thesis document.  When did that go out for external examination?  What education and training system?  He still on payroll?  How old is he now?  When was he supposed to have retired?  Are you still claiming Frank Jackson is on Payroll, too?  For all the supervision he's done over the last 20 years or so.  What is he, now?  I'm serious..  Is he 90?  Is he even still alive??  Where does his payroll go?</p>
