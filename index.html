    <p>When people don't have the power to say 'no' they also don't have the power to say 'yes'.  That is to say, when the power to say 'no' goes away there is no meaningful 'yes'.  And...  The stupid thing about the whole situation...  Is that so very very very very very many people would choose 'yes'.  But they don't get to.  Because you force them to comply.  Because you will not uphold the 'no'.  WHich only reinforces that nobody actually has the power to say 'yes'.   P.S., don't forget to 'spread your legs' for New Zealand's covid response.  Wink wink nudge nudge Christopher Hipkins.  Whose you Mummy?  I mean, let's be clear...  We delay delay delay compensation until the people are dead.  Haha!  That was our objective, the purpose, the point, all along.  We win, you lose.  How else can we possibly get that through your thick skulls?  You can cry cry cry cry cry about how any compensation coming to you is only going to be used up in palliative care (never ever ever in investment in any kind of future) and still you likely won't get anything.  But, at least you understnd that you never ever ever get to invest in any kind of future.  By the time Chris Hipkins and his selfish genes have taken up everything that they think they are worth there's nothing left for anybody else.  The social hierarcy is clear.  Sacrosanct.  Spread your legs for Chris Hipkins else you have no future at all.  Consider yourself lucky if you are one of the chosen ones and he chooses to display himself in your direction.  That's what it is or means to be part of the nasty little despot this part of the world.  Evidence to the contrary?
