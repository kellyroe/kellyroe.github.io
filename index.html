 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">  

                            <p>
                            Who has applied to study a 120 point 1 EFT research masters qualification and had that signed off as completed within 34 weeks of enrolment?  Anybody?  Can you name me one person? 
                            </p>

                            <p>If you think that has happened, check your transcript.  Don't forget to check what the online version has to say now, as well.  The one they will say is the correct one when a prospective employer makes an inquiry.  Does it match the paper one that you have?  I guess if you complain about their 'software update' they throw you in prison for altering your enrolment records.  Is that the idea?  You should never never never stop paying for their crimes.  THey can't even keep accurate enrolment records.  Nobody home.   Nothing there.</p>

                            <p>
                            Who has applied to study a 360 point 3 EFT doctoral qualification and had that signed off as completed within 3 academic years of enrolment?  Anybody?  Can you name me one person?  Check your transcripts.
                            </p>

                            <p>Can you name for me a single person who has had their graduate level research *sent out for external examination by the University* in time for the externals to *possibly* sign off on completion of the qualifiation within the enrolment period?  I mean to say, if it takes 3 months to externally examine a 1 year research project with a 34 week enrolment period then the thesis will need to go out to externals at around the 22 week mark.  Can you name for me a single research student who has had their research sent out for external examination no later than the 22 week mark?  A single student?</p>

                            <p>What University?</p>

                            <p>The problem is not that there are certain topics that are off-limits.  The problem is that all topics are off-limits.  No research will be acknowledged as having been done.  The University gets more and more and more and more money from the government for keeping the hostages re re re re re re enrolled while the people on payroll do everything they can to prevent and prohibit the production of high quality timely research.  It is not possible.  They are not on payroll to do research.  They are on payroll to bully their studnets into being re re re re re re re enrolled for more and more and more money for the University.  The VC wants a payrise.  Therefore they must double and triple bill student enrolments for more and more and more money for the University.  The same brains behind Canterbury District Health Board refusing to even try and operate within the Government Approved Budget (their intentionally trying to blow the budget for special handouts every f*cking year) is now inspiring the University of Otago to similarly cook their books.  Claim to be too poor to pay the workers etc etc for increasing payroll for the VC etc.  What research output?  Take a look at the research output of the people on payroll to do research.  Do they do 5,000 words of research per year?  Less?  What University?   </p>

                            <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/490714/victoria-university-lack-of-government-funding-blamed-for-proposed-job-cuts The Vice Chancellor has exercised pay restraint for themselves, then?  Or has the Vice Chancellor made it clear that he's taking from the University absolutely everything he can get?  Take everything you can for as long as you can simply because you can.  How much money do the VC's of NZ Universities take for themselves each and every year?  To employ researchers without research output to refuse to send students research out for external examination.  Not even pretending to base the outcome of examination on the reports of external examiners.  What Universities?  There's nothing there.  Prison.  Detention.  Slave camps.  Nasty nasty business.  Not actually any kind of business at all.  F*cking psychopaths. </p>

                            <p>The 'word salad' is really getting underway, now.  Advertising for people to be paid as cleaners to assist with surgeries.  That is a step ahead for NZ, right?  To have people paid as cleaners assisting with surgeries.  What we usually do is have building apprentices assisting with surgeries.  That's how we decide who to scrub in -- right?  We only let the studnets who aren't on the roll attend cadavar dissection laboratory.  The ones without identification cards, without student identification numbers.  We have the surgeries attended  by people who aren't on payroll (not even as cleaners) usually.  People who pay and pay and pay and pay the University because the VC needs a payrise.  They need to restructure the University so that people can re re re re re apply for their old job for less pay.  Because otherwise the VC wouldn't feel like he was winning at life.  Cry cry cry cry cry about how the government underpays the University while the VC takes at least half a million out for themself each and every year...  Re re re re re enrolling studnets for double and triple billing for the University.  F*cking psychopaths.  There's nothign of any value there.  What value?  What values?  F*cking slavers.</p>
