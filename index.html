                            <p>That's great.  Really.  Now...  With the same level of engagement..  Lie flat.  Stand tall.  </p>

                            <p>Comprehend.  Aye?</p>

                            <p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X97ZWux7L4  And then you stretch up tall and lie flat.  Apparently 1 year to collection (good anterior hold or hollow body hold).  Then, I don't know how much time to pull a solid hollow body hold out long.  To lie flat...</p>

                            <p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL10ZCD90E</p>

                            <p>Focus on what is important.  Can you?</p>

                            <p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkX6yVKY-GU Hahahahaha welcome to your full time jobs lolz just sayin  </p>

                            <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC3XaRYkPeQ  Hmm.  Well. Now.  That is surely a thing to do.  Not entirely sure that I understand it...  But that is surely a thing to do...</p>

                            <p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEhQMFsOUmE  The girl on the right.  Integrity.  Can you see? </p>

                            <p>And I would say:  Why would you do that to your athelets?  Is the aim to encourage them to exceed your expectations all (why would you have things any other way) or to elimate them (insofar as you can get away with it) only?  Do you want to recruit belivers of or in your training system or is your contribution to elimnate the rivals only?  You decide.  Do you have a training system or a detention extermination or elimination camp only?</p>

                            <p>Oh, but of course the world knows that NZ leads the world in equestrian sports.  Mark Todd and all that.  He is to equestrian sports as Winston Peters is to politics.  Or similar.  Everybody stop.  They are the world leaders.  Get in behind y'all.</p>

                            <p>You can see -- right?  They are trying so hard.  The horses and the handlers both.  Everybody gets it. It would be real  pretty if they could rear up on their hind legs and kick forwards... If they could rear up on their hind legs and kick up enough to be able to kick out and then land the kick...  That would look real pretty.  Everyone gets it.  The handlers.  The horses.  It is quite an accompishment.  To do what they do.  How many years of training...  Etc.  Not only the horses. The riders aren't riding like sacks of lard apon horses that are obviously too good for them...  That's a thing..  But to think that NZ is world leading in horses or training of horses.  Pffft. Guffaw.  Or simlar.  Where is the evidence of that?  Mark Todd?  Like Winston Peters is evidence of non-racist democracy? Yeah, right.</p>

                            <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtVFVGe5xg8  Of course... But you aren't even asking him to do...  </p>

                            <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw3GglvEAGc  Wow. Hey.  That's good to know.</p>
