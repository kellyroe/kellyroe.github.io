                            <p>The only reason I go on about my GPA is because they say that entry to Medicine is `highly selective' or `competitive' -- on the basis of GPA, primarily.  But they do not seem to be selecting candidates on the basis of their GPA when they proritise entry for teenagers (who haven't even completed 1 year of University study) or they prioritise adults (who have attained the age of 20 years) who, again, haven't even completed 1 year of University study.</p>

                            <p>I have letters from the `University' of Auckland asserting that my GPA (the best 120 points of the last 2 years of graded university study towards completed qualifications -- including summer school papers that are above stage 1) is 8.0 and that my GPA was below the mean of the GPA from the other applicants and that I simply was not rank order scored high enough for offer of place.  I pointed out to them that they miscalculated my GPA (according to their own algorithm as to how they will calculate it for the purposes of entry to MBChB). I pointed it out to the Dean.  Every level of their complaints resolution process or procedure.  Stuart McCutcheon in his capacity as VC.  Dawn Freshwater in her capacity as VC.  The High Court Judge.  She would not order them to go away and consider my application again -- this time processing it within the laws.  I am a domestic adult who has attained the age of 20 years.  I am eligible by statute.  No new qualifications need to be completed for me to be eligible.  None of the 18 or 19 year olds applying from first year had completed a qualification from a NZ University within the last 5 years or, in fact, ever.  They are still entitled to a free secondary education.  So they expedite them into Medicine to record debt against their name.  What education and training system? </p>

                            <p>My filings for the tenancy tribunal were AFTER the trade centre in Auckland burned down twice.  I don't see that it is possible to do business in a jurisdiction that won't uphold the law.</p>
