                             Not sure what date to put on that.  My ANU file notes show that I supplied the administration with evidence that I had a document of the requisite length to go out to external examiners at a time when I was enrolled as a doctoral candidate for the ANU.  How many years are you supposed to hand over research outputs before they get that work out for external examination?  3 years extendible to 4.  They still haven't sent it out for external examination.  How can they claim to be a University?  I don't remember any of the students having publically scheduled oral defences.  There's nothing there. 
                            </p>

                            <p>I returned to NZ to do MBChB (Medicine).  They aren't properly processing the applications to enrol in that programme of study.  They won't do it.  They refuse to calculate my GPA properly.  They refuse to enrol candidates on the basis of the published selection criterion.  They instruct me to `keep working' on a new qualification for `the purposes of eligibility' when the Education and Trianing Act states that I am eligible because I have attained the age of 20 years and I applied to be enrolled in that qualification.  I wrote a 120 point MPhil thesis for Waikato here (the TEC says that's 34 weeks of enrolment including the external examination period):</p>

                            <p>3 spiral bound copies of the above was shipped to the Dean of the Research School on 14 September 2018 for the purposes of external examination only.  I still have not received reports from externals.</p>

                            <p>This thesis (that has a chapter on race-based admissions practices for Medicine, particularly) was completed prior to US students taking race based admission practices to the Courts.  The Courts of NZ said that my court cases (initiated in 2019 and 2020) were `not matters of public interest'.  </p>

                            <p>They don't seem to be willing or able to tell the difference between (1) whether you did the work to the requisite standard or not (academic merits to be determined by an independent and external assessment on the basis of academic merits) and whether they like what you said, or not.  Whether they prefer to keep you slave slave slaving for low to no wages.  </p>

                             <p>3 spiral bound copies of the above was shipped to the Dean of the Research School on 05 October 2018 for the purposes of external examination for a 120 point 1 EFT MPhil thesis only.  The University sent it to externals with templates for them to write `doctoral reports'.  I don't know if they were paid to examine a masters thesis else if they were paid for writing doctoral reports.  Check the accounts.  My invoice from the `University' specifies 'payable by doctoral examination fee waiver'</p>

                             <p><a href="./publish/2019-rep-1.pdf">Roe, K.  (2019). Disability and equity for medicine and public health.  24 February.</a></p>

                             <p>This was substantively updated in response to the `doctoral reports' within 10 weeks.  It was supplied to the University of Waikato to get back to the anonymous examiners so they could sign off on the qualification completion and it was also supplied to Stuart McCutcheon as evidence that I completed the 120 point MPhil in 2018.  That means I was ready to start MBChB with the University of Auckland (if and only if my rank order score was high enough for offer of place).  I did not apply for an equity place.  That means to say if my rank order score was 100 and there were 300 places in the programme only then there would need to have been 201 equity candidates promoted ahead of me to justify them not offering enrolment to me.  Do you understand?  The University of Auckland told me my application was declined because my rank order score was not high enough.  They did not calculate my GPA according to their published algorithm.  Their published algorith makes it 8.6.  They then said I was `ineligible to have applied' because they don't accept the Education and Training Act declares me eligible.  They will not process the applications properly.   The University never got this to externals:</p>

                              <p><a href="./publish/2019-rep-2.pdf">Roe, K.  (2019)Disability and equity for medicine and public health.  30 June.</a></p>

                              <p>This was sent to externals for `masters examination' 30 June 2019.  The only examiner based outside Australasia requested an oral defence so the `University' updated my transcript to record that I was enrolled in 20 points of MPhil for 2019 (I never applied to that programme) then enrolled under the zero fee scheme for 0 points for several months.  I have a letter saying they will be indefinately detaining me under zero fee enrollment scheme until my thesis is accepted by externals (but of course they won't allow the externals to accept it).  </p>

                              <p>What education and training programme?  What Universities?  They are keeping false enrolment records.  Saying they have students enrolled under the zero fee scheme when they aren't eligible to be enrolled under the zero fee scheme.  That was for students to go to university for their first year.  Ones who would get more money earning minimum government wage or get more money on unemployment.  They were going to hold them under the zero fee univesrity scheme for 1 year to delay them a year of wages.  The `Universities' are refusing to get work to externals.  I don't know anybody who received reports from externals for graduate research programmes in Australasia - except myself (and the initial reports were for  a qualification that I wasn't even enrolled in!).  When were the publically scheduled oral examinations?  To check that the people they are giving doctorates to actually did the work themselves.  That they understand it.  Can explain it.  Can answer questions from the public about it?  What Universities?</p>

                              <p>They can't even / won't even acknowledge or accept GPA's that they themselves gave out.  They won't get work out to externals much of the time.  They won't allow externals to sign off on qualification completions.  When externals request oral examination they refuse to schedule them.  They aren't even trying to be fair, at all.  Prison or detention camps.  There's nothing there in fact.  They aren't even trying to be fair.</p>

                              <p>Take a look at all the `research outputs' of the `universities'.  All the wrongful deaths and sexual violations etc etc for the `controlled populations' in the name of science or medical research.  What a f*cking joke.  Nobody else applied.  Yeah, right.  All the applications thrown away so they could expedite the likes of Dr Leeks because of everything it is that they value.  What values?  What a f*cking joke.  Hoax.  Scummy scam.  Not even trying to be fair at all.</p>

                              <p>It is not true that various people who were enrolled in MBChB deserved to be there.  The Vice Chancellor of the University of Queensland believed that his daughter was enrolled in their Medical Degree Programme even when there were various others who were declined places who were ranked more highly on their objective selection algorithm (grades and examination score based).  She did not deserve to be there. She stole a place from someone else.  She did not earn the place.  Her father earned over half a million dollars per year, as Vice Chancellor and he couldn't / wouldn't pay for tutoring and all the extra help that she needed to have earned herself enrolment in the progarmme if that was what she really wanted to do.  He had to cheat her a place that should have gone to someone else.</p>

                              <p>We are supposed to believe that the NZ `Universities' aren't similarly cheating places for various people's children.  What else explains why they are so determined to enrol them in Medicine when they are 18 before they have even completed 1 year of University study.  Before many of them have even left their parents homes.  Why the hurry?  Why the great rush?  Why must they be enrolled quickly quickly quickly before htey have enrolled in any other courses at University level.  So they can take them away on camping trips.  Maybe move the guy involved in the nudity etc at the Law Camp of Otago (normalising this kind or sort of behaviour for the future kings counsel and judges one can only suppose) and re-employ him at Auckland.  Everything it is that they value, right there.  Cry cry cry for more migrant workers they don't see any people here.  Pay and pay and pay for visa processing fees and migration only to get here and see that they won't pay the workers.  How expensive was 10 day Orthopedics hire who left his wife at Hillmorton?  How much money did that little project raise for NZ administration?  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                              <p>Shane Reti is supposed to be a success of the Maaori equity pathway to Medicine programme?</p>

                              <p>So the idea is supposed to be that no Maaori will be enrolled in Medicine.  Medicine is a degree for the administrations children and Maaori are the underclass and not the administration.  They don't get to administrate their own death camps, surely!  That would be like putting a Jew in charge of the death camps of Nazi Germany, or something.  Employing them as doctors to work within to document any source of meaning that people found so that it could be eliminated.  </p>

                              <p>So the Maaori equity pathway was supposed to be good for Maaori because it will enrol a maximum number of them in acccordance with the quota cap.  So, they say that 10 places will go to Maaori.  But only if they get Maaori who are `eligibile to have applied' and so they just throw the applications away saying they didn't receive them or say that the person wasn't eligible (maybe murder them off or throw them in a prison or a psychiatric facility) so the Maaori places are returned to the `general pool' as they put it.  To go to the children of the administration.  Dr Leeks.  The ones he wanted to take away on camping trips.  </p>

                              <p>  So, maybe 5 Maaori are taken into the programme so they can hold the brown faces up and say that their programme is working.  The people of Northland have a Maaori Determatologist, they Shane Reti?  The highest rates of skin cancer in the world, wasn't it?  When the kiddies weren't having photos of them taken with them having rickets or scarlet fever.  Having penacilin withheld (wouldn't want to breed antibiotic resistent bacteria in people when we are workign so hard to breed it in the chickens given improper doses of antibiotic often prophylactically or antibiotics given to prevent mastitis in the cows to be fed to the people in the milks and so on...  The eggs...  The shells..</p>

                              <p>Anyway..  Shane Reti is evidnece the Maaori pathway to Medicine programme is working!</p>

                              <p>The Education and Training Act grants the Universities discretion to PROMOTE candidates on basis of their being from an under-represented group.</p>

                              <p>I applied to MBChB with Auckland in 2018 (for 2019 start) and in 2019 (for 2020 start).  Both years the University of Auckland (when Warwick Bagg gets on the phone to me and has a yakkity yak yak yak)..  Both years...  They refuse to enter my GPA into their algorithm and tell me my rank order score.  Justice Fitzgerald declares me to be ELIGIBLE for enrolment in Medicine.   BY STATUTE.  The University of Auckland refuses to enter my GPA into their rank order score (along my with UMAT / UCAT and interview score) and say what my rank order place is.  They won't do it.</p>

                              <p>I did not apply for an equity place.  I wrote a thesis on disability - but that doesn't mean I'm intellectually handicapped.  Can you hear the difference?</p>

                              <p>If my rank ordr score was 20 and there were 300 places in the programme then they would have needed to have 300-20 for a total of 281 equity candidates promoted ahead of me for me to have been demoted to rank order 301.  Do  you understand?  That's the discretion that they have.    </p>

                              <p>They have discretion to take a non-equity candidate (me) and promote equity members (all the 18 year old kiddies from the rural elite boarding schools in NZ whose Mummies and Daddies don't want to pay for them to go to Harvard because they get `rural priority entrance for equity' in NZ)...  They have the discretion to take the richest kiddies in Wanaka etc etc in the name of equity.  Oh, and Maaori, of course..  And promote these on equity grounds.  But they refused to promote enough on equity grounds to justify why they did not offer enrolment to me. </p>

                              <p>What was my rank order score?  It was obviously high enough for enrolment.  That was why they wen to the lengths they did.  Refusing to calculate my GPA and refusing to enter it into their selection algorithm.  Telling me to take it to the courts.  Choosing to hire major law firms to represent them.  Government departments.  Governmnt agengies.  The `Universities' of New Zealadn choose to hire major law firms to defend their entitlement to throw away applications on grounds of `ineligibility' when teh statutes say they don't have that power.  The judges will not order or instruct them to follow the laws.  What judiciary?</p>

                              <p>The f*cking death camps.  They will have things no other way.  They won't process the applications.</p>

                              <p>Now, I'm pretty sure they hire people on $30,000 a year or similar to say they are doing the application to enrol processing.  But of course it's from higher up that the data entry is changed.  So that the daughter of the VC gets a place and someone else's place is removed.  Stolen from them.  I don't suppose it is the lowest ranked workers who are only kept there to take the fall.  </p>

                              <p>I have emails from both Stuart McCutcheon and Dawn Freshwater (was that really the name that her mother gave her?) that show that they are not willing to follow the laws of NZ.  What Medical School?  There isn't anything there.</p>

                              <p>I call it 'leading from behind'.  YOu are f*cking welcome.</p>

                              <p>`The exception that proves the rule'.   No.  I was the typical ordinary applicant.  A domestic adult who had attainted the age of 20 years who applied to the progarmme.  Who did not request equity criterion to be applied to my application.  So everybody accepted ahead of me was required to be an equity candidate.  Comprehend.  Aye?</p>

                              <p>I guess Shane will be doing what everybody seem to.  Look at closing off that loop hole.  They made it!  They have money!  They have all the money and all the power!  Now they seek and exterminate anybody who has a claim to anything at all...  Seek and destroy...  The Otago study was about finding out how various things were escaping NZ so they could close off those `opportunities'.  Make things that much worse for the next generation.  March them off to the death camps so that various others can be the only game in town.  I suppose Shane Reti wants what most people want...  To eliminate as many Maaori as possible.  So Shane Reti can be the only game in town.  When did he get accepted to study as a Dermatologist, in NZ?  He passed the exams, did he?  Or did his father pay them an amount of money?  How does it go?  To manage the controlled population with one of the highest rates of cancer in teh world.  Was he doing a good job?  Is that what that looks like?  Growing his patient base?  To manage one of the youngest patient bases in the world?  How much money they get selling the kiddies brains to Harvard (after killing the bodies).  That's the brain bank.  Right?  Do the people from Harvard pick out which kid to  be culled?  How does that go, exactly?</p>
