    <p>'One of the issues which has been identified by the network is that the NCEA results in rural areas are limiting the pool of prospective students'.  https://www.odt.co.nz/opinion/editorial/rural-gp-training-proposal-welcome 
    </p>

    <p> They are throwing away applications, and then crying about how they don't have enough.  The Education and Training Act states that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible to be enrolled in the programme they have applied for.  But they throw their applications away because they want wide eyed teenagers who will do anything anything anything before tossing them away.
    </p>

    <p>
    They are refusing to train a new generation of GPs because new GPs will get a job only over the dead bodies of the old GPs and the old GPs have no intention of dying for the next 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 or 100 years and so they have no intention of training new GPs.  I mean, why would anybody voluntariliy choose to give up their payroll?  It doesn't make any sense.  And why would they sign off on completion of training from someone who might be paid instead of them.  WHy would they set themselves up for potentially having less money.  It doesn't make any sense.
    </p>

    <p>Rinse and repeat for everything else.  We don't have any teachers, nurses, lawyers, judges, police, plumbers, electricians.  It's soooooo competitive.  Nobody applies to do those things.  Nobody graduates from those qualifications.  Nobody applies for those jobs.   Nobody is on payroll to work those jobs.  Just a  bunch of 60 or 70 or 80 year olds on 3x or 4x the payroll while they take the 'work' outputs of the younger ones (who pay the university who pay the university who pay the university who pay who pay who pay for their 'training')...  All the ones kept on government welfare (less than minimum wage)...  Take all the 'work' outputs until the day that they die.  Apparently it's sooooooooo competitive.  There will be a job for me only over however many dead bodies.  Waiting waiting waiting for the bodies to die.  Allllll the payroll for them.  ALlllll the payroll for them.  ALlllll the payroll for them.  Allll of the payroll for them.</p> 

    <p>The courts have ruled that the universities don't have to examine studnets work.  They don't have to get their work to externals.  They don't have to give students qualifiations when they have done the work for them.  The secondary schools don't have to either.  I mean, it doesn't matter how well you score in your NCEA examinations if your teachers want to collect up more and more and more money for keeping you enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled then they don't have to pass you.  Why would they pass you?  Why wouldn't they pass all and only the ones who cannot function independently.  That's a great idea.  That way they can be sure that they are the only ones on payroll.  All of the payroll for them.  All of the payroll for them.  But what payroll?  Australian Payroll no work for New Zealand teachers.  Australian Payroll  no work.  Keeping of slaves...  The Univesrities are blatently functioning as slave prison or detention camps.  They aren't employing people willing and able to do research.  They are intentionally employing people who are unwilling and or unable to do research.  They knowingly put people on payroll with the intent that they will refuse to graduate students so as to keep slaves hostages prisoners.  There's nothing in Australasia.  Unless you want to be a slaver.  Prison guard.  Keeper of hostages.  Micro-manage other people's work me-wards only for allll of the payroll nd alll of the credit for you.  That's how come they can re-deploy people so easily..  There is no difference.  It's all the same.  The keeping of hostages and slaves.  Train in one thing and get less payroll for doing something different entirely.  Qualifications not acknowledged anymore . Only given in the first place because they never would be.  ALl of the honorary degrees only that don't mean anything at all.  There's nothing to see...  It doesn't matter what the laws are because the courts refuse to uphold the laws.  THey won't write fair examination scripts or even if they do they won't fairly examine the work tkhat has been done.  They won't blind grade work on it's academic merits.  ALl the energy and effort and time and expense that goes into the keeping of slaves.  The lowest value economy in the world.  By design.  The leaders seem determined to keep it so.  The courts seem to think their job or role is to compound injustices only.  There's nothing here.</p>

    <p>How many old people do we want in rural communities?  Well, then.  Just put a bunch of murdering pedophile psychopaths out there as community leaders and let them gnaw each other to death.  Problem solved.  Then we can declare theis land terra nullus and everywhere else lin teh world can send their undesirables here.  Teh arse end of nowhere.  Nothing here.  All of the medical experiments can be done on the peple down here.  It's sooooooo competitive.  Soooooooo competitive.  Sooooooo competitive.  How many FTE's was Ailsa Claire, again?  MOre than half  million to do what?  To keep hostages and cry cry cry cry cry to the government for more money.  How many FTE's was the VC of the University of Auclkand?  More than half a million to do what?  To keep hostages and cry cry cry cry cry to the government for more money.   How many FTE's was Una Jagose again?  NOtice a common theme here?  HOw many people 'don't count' for the purposes of rates of unemployment?  How many people are actully paid to work full time jobs in New Zealand?  There is really nothing here...  I guess they will be paying people in bitcoin soon.  Because states aren't allowed to print their own money / mint their own coin.  But, of course, the NZ dollar is ordered to be printed by Australia, I belive.  To disguise and conceal that they don't pay New Zealanders Australian wages.  Keeping people gnawing each other to death over scraps.  Wasteland.  Indeed.  But the worst of it is the energy and effort nd time nd expense that goes into ensuring that  this is so and this is how it must remain.  No hint of 'try'.  No good deed goes unpunished in these lands.</p>

    <p>The courts are still refusing to pay compensation to the victims of Dr Leeks.  Meanwhile they are deliberating on whether another child should be given to other Medical 'Professionals' to do whatever they want with for a weekend (open heart surgery with blood units and plasma from Australia) before he is given back to his parents.  That's convenient.  The courts and the government can simply mandate that people are required to follow orders or instructions in these parts.  There is already no opt off from record sharing systems.  That way they can get teh important research data out, you see.  From all the medical experiments that are being done on people in these parts.  That's presumably how come we only 'treat' the involuntary.  Non-voluntary.  Non-consenting.  There's nothing here.  They won't train a workforce.  But they also won't get out of the way when people do learn how to do things in spite of and despite of them.  NOt because of them because why would someone voluntarily choose to walk away from however much money.  There's nothing in these parts.  Party party party lets have a party lets muster up the biggest mob to take to take to take.  There's nothing here.</p>

    <p>People know Kim Sterelny. They know what kind of person he is.  The world is very hostile and it's sooooooo competitive.  All the thinking is driven by people trying to gnaw each other's arms off.  It's soooooo surprising that there is anything anything anything at all.  These are the stories they looooove to here.  Allll of the research funding for him and the hostile world that he is building that makes them feel like they are such successes at and in life.  It's all soooooooo competitive.  People know what he's like inter-personally.  'You f*cked the dog' and 'f*cking c*nt' and so on and so forth.  But he's jokey jokey and so it's okay.  Most highly esteemed on payroll.  All of the payroll for him.  Alll of the payroll for him.  ALlll of the payroll for him.  Or, let's see...  Professor Martin Davies.  He got a couple  hundred thousand dollars ARC grant to work on delusions.  I got paid to do a summer scholarship and give a department talk.  I did the work I was paid to do over the summer.  Martin Davies then refuses to write me a reference. Who the f*ck doesn't write someone a reference saying that they did the job they were contracted when they did the f*cking job they were contracted?  What the hell kind of person does that?  I guess you probably need to take a look at people in the Northern Hemisphere (around Oxford) and the work that I did on the topic of delusions and see who got credited for my work.  Since my work isn't credited for me or to me at all.  Allll of the payroll for him.  Allll of the payroll for him.  Is he f*cking dead yet?  Sterelny would say.  Is he f*cking dead yet?  Or how about Dave Chalmers.  Let's see..  The Zombie Army of New York.  I suppose it did in deed come to be.  All these young adults..  Right bout when it was time to pay them.  Time to sign off on their qualification completion.  Time to sign off on completion of their training.  They all up and died of Covid.  Depopulated the city  a bit so there was room for old retired people people to move into the city.  And they wouldn't have to worry about paying the old retired people. Except of course they likely aren't retired at all.  All of the payroll for them.  ALl of the payroll for them.  Let's send generations of people off to die because it's soooooo cmopetitive.  Once people have 3x or 4x or 9x the payroll that's how many people need to die for them?  It's soooooo competitive.  It's sooooo cmopetitive.  Are they f*cking dead yet?  How about today?  Did they die today?  Can I has payroll now?  You could just hand me your work and your payroll too.  Right?  Just hand it oer and go curl up and die now, there's a good boy.  Alllllll of the payroll for you.  Your grand plan, there of nasty brutish and short tragedy of commons race to the bottom psychopath land overtaken by taken over by psychopaths.  All of the everything for you.  ALll of the everything for you.   You you you and your f*cking selfishh.  Just f*cking take everything.  There's nothing here.  No universities at all.  No helthcare.  No judiciary.  No speak English.  Cant' parse the constitution.  Does not matter what any of the laws are  becuase they refuse to uphold them.  No point passing new ones or anything.  No point hearing the cases because they can't / won't uphold the laws.  They pretend to be too stupid to read them.  There' snothing here. .  Nothing nothing nothing at all.  Wah wah wah mooooooore money.  There aren't any people.  March them off to die..   Breed more breed more breed more.  Then put them on ventillators and remove them when it's time to graduate them or time to put them on payroll.  Nothing here.  Nobody home. </p>

    <p>They won't fund social services.  And nobody wants 'social services'.   Not voluntarily.  Who voluntarily chooses to go off to a 'social service' school to be abused by pedophiles?  But they insist on screening and selecting and choosing pedophiles to put them on payroll as teachers.  To trade them around.  Most highly valued employees, apparently. They would only employ pedophiles if only they could find enough pedophiles to entirely populate the whole teaching profession with them.  But they are so very very very in demand, they want them for Medicien, too.  Dr Leeks most highly valued esteemed member of the profession who needed to be re-deployed to continue on his crimes in Melbourne after he'd rolled out is social service programme for New Zealand.  So, then, who voluntarily chooses to do education in NZ.  To have healthcare in NZ.  I mean, there's nothing there.  What do you have to do to reduce demand for social services.  The government takes all of the tax money (for trafficking mostly children for sex offenses, one can only suppose) and takes all of the payroll all of the payroll all of the payroll and shares it around with the money makers..  ANd everyone else can curl up and die.  Once they've takekn everything from them...  They can, what did the courts say 'burn themselves out'.  That's what people do.  They voluntrily choose to hnd over all fo their work nd all of their payroll to the pedophiles and psychopaths.  Riiiiight.  That's how we ensure we have the lowest valued people in the world for everyone else to do experiments on etc.  Real destination for all the psychopaths in the world.  The leaders can't even parse the constitution.  I guess that was why they were carefully hand-picked to lead.  I mean, it can't be that hard to find someone who lacks the cpacity to process an application and pay them half a million dollars per year to not process applications.  There aren't any people in NZ, apparently.   Nobody applied.  See, they designed the forms such that when you hit 'submit' the form jams so that they could say nobody applied.  They put a 'you failed to pass the test to establish that you are not a robot' declaration on the form for when you lodge a complint with the human rights people.  I mean to say the people on payroll designed a system to tell people that they failed the test to establish that they were a person when they try and lodge a complaint bout human rights violation.  There is nothing in these lnds.  It is a garbage land of nothing.  I understand various people pat themselves on teh back all self-congradulatory that htey made it in life.  HOw many slaves do they keep?  That's the measure or the mark of success in these lands.  Right?  How many people were murdered or how many hostages are there such that they can smugly congradulate themselves on everything it is that they are and everything it is that they have.  All the work they do to undermine and stabotage and prevent and prohibit and obstruct and lie and cheat and swindle and...  That's the only game in town.  Right?  Psychopath land.  Puts out a beacon to the world begging to be put out of it's misery.  Nobody wnted things to be any different.  They didnt' get any applications or any applicants who wanting anything to be different.  Just a  bunch people tucking in behind there then trying to prove their worth with how many heads they got.  There's nothing here.</p>
