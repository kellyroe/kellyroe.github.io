                             </p> 


                         

                             <p>_______</p>

                             <p>This site is the first webpage (or webpages) that I built.  I know it does not look particularly good from modern aesthetic or design point of view.  That is not what this is, though.  I was mostly concerned to self-publish content that various supervisors or universities either did not get out for external examination or did not give me appropriate credit for.</p>

                             <p>In some instances my work has been given to others (or taken by others) and they have taken credit for it.  For example, Fiona MacPhearson took work I did on delusions and put it with some of her work on synasthesia.  She did not acknowledge or reference me as the source.  I don't know if the work that has been credited to John Matthewson on 'function' was him taking my work and reskinning it for credit for himself.  I could imagine Paul Griffiths and Kim Sterelny having a good laugh about that.  They are not very nice people, in case you don't know.  Lacking in honesty and integrity.</p>

                             <p>The work that I gave them.  What credit or recognition did they give me?</p>

                             <p>I will also get the filings to the courts up so that people can see how NZL does not appear to be trying to have a functioning judiciary.  </p>

                             <p>Chris Whelan is both overwhelmed by complaints and also in the position where not a single person has made a complaint of serious wrongdoing about any of the 'Universities' of NZ.  </p>

                             <p>The whole time I was at the Australian National University (through a summer research scholarship and then however many years that they kept me enrolled in doctoral study without providing any supervisory comments on my thesis and without getting it out to external examiners) I never saw any student have a scheduled oral defence to publically defend their thesis.  I did not see any evidence at all of any student being presented with reports from external examiners offering critique of their thesis.  I don't know how the 'University' decided which studnets to give PhD's to, and when.  I don't think that they treated me fairly at all, in fact. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                              Anyway, I self publish the work that I did for them while I was enrolled with them beacuse I can only be responsible for the work that I did.  Various people were on payroll to supervise me.  They only had a handful of research students at any one time and they had no teaching committments to either graduate or undergraduate studnets.  The University administration was given my table of contents which informed them that I had more than 100,000 worrds of research output -- and they never contacted me about when it was going to be forwarded to externals.  I can't say that I'd recommend anybody enrol in doctoral level qualification in Australasia.  Else, if you do, plan to physically remove yourself from the environment (and cut all contact) after you have given them a doctoral thesis after 2 years of work.  Either they get it out to external examiners or you publish it yourself.  You did the work that you were supposed to do for the doctoral programme.  They payroll various people to not do any of the things that they are supposed to do.  The environment is bullying and abusive.</p>

                              <p>Wah wah wah we don't have any doctors.  It's soooo competitive we killed and ate them all.  There aren't any people left.  </p>
