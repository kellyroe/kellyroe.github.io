                                <a href="https://kellyroe.github.io/publish/cv050124.pdf">CV last updated 05/01/24</a>


                            </p>

                            <p>I have provided clickable links to how I calculated my GPA.</p>

                            <p>It is relevant because the `Universities' of NZ say that entry to Medicine is `competitive' or `selective' on the basis of GPA, primarily, but they really are not selecting candidates on this basis.</p>

                            <p>The `University' of Auckland advised me to complete a new qualification from a NZ University for purposes of eligibility.  They said that if I completed a 120 point MPhil from the University of Waikato then my grades would come from previous qualifications that I had already completed.  This is because the MPhil (like the PhD) is not a graded qualification.  So completing a `higher research degree' does not alter your GPA.  </p>

                            <p>It turns out that the Education and Training Act says that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years (as I had) are eligible to be enrolled in the programme that they have applied to.  I applied to study Medicine, therefore I was eligible to study Medicine.  I didn't need to do a new qualification for the purposes of eligibility.</p>

                            <p>But still.  They still won't get the theses out to external examiners.  They send them out for the wrong qualification.  They won't allow externals to sign off on completion.  They won't get the updated thesis back to externals to prevent their sign off.  When the only examiner based outside Australasia says to schedule an oral defence they won't do it.</p>

                            <p>Prison camps.  Detention camps.  How can they claim to have an education and training system when they are expediting people into Medicine (for example) when they have little to no educational background at all and they refuse to acknowledge GPA's that they have awarded?  How is it that my qualifications are supposed to be obsolete and expired while all these people on payroll (most particularly Judges past the compulsory age of retirement for Judges) simply will not get out.</p>

                            <p>
                            There is nothing there.  Hey.
                            </p>

                            <p>I was also going to put all the Judicial Review of Administrative Action content into a single PDF -- but it was getting a bit too lengthy and difficult to compile.  I'll need to do one document per case.  Should be done by the end of the weekend.
                            </p>

                            <p>What health system?  What education system?  What judiciary?  Not even trying to be rule by law.  </p>
