                        <div class="container">

                            <p> 
                                <a href="https://kellyroe.github.io/writing/realmecv.pdf">Chronological CV</a>
                             </p>

                             <p>
                                 What does it mean to have a PhD?  The PhD programme (in Australasia) is a 3 EFT programme, extendible to up to 4 EFTS.  1 EFT is 1 full-time year of enrolment.  That means the programme is supposed to take between 3 and 4 years.  I think I read something somewhere about a minimum enrolment period of 2 years.
                             </p>

                             <p>
                                 Great.  So, you enrol in the programme and you write various pieces.  You write a thesis.  A book.  Basically.  Of up to 100,000 words.  
                             </p>

                             <p>
                                 And the University is supposed to provide you with supervision.  What does that mean?  Someone is supposed to help you, I guess.  I would say.  At the very least to periodically provide you with concrete feedback on your work.  To help it be better.  I would suppose.  Or maybe it's a competition environment.  Various people are payrolled to bully and abuse you into handing over your work -- so they can credit the author of it as being someone else.  Give your work to someone else.  Maybe claim it for themself.  Whatever..  Bully you into walking away without recieving public credit or acknowledgement for the work that you've done.  Without writing you references etc.  Why do a thing like that?  Because it's sooo competitive, apparently.  And the supervisors get various funding for being the only game in town, or something.  They were the only applicant for the funding.  There was no alternative.  That kind or sort of a thing.
                             </p>

                             <p>
                                 The University is supposed to get the work that you did out for external examination.  So that it can be externally examined by someone who wasn't involved in the production of the work.  They are supposed to write reports on it.  There is supposed to be an oral defence.  At the very least the external examiners are supposed to check that the student who the University wants to credit as the author understands the work. Therefore may possibly have been the author of it.  It wasn't taken from one student and attributed to another.  It wasn't written by the supervisor and given to a student who doesn't have the willingness or ability to work independently at all.
                             </p>

                             <p>What do you do when the University won't get your work out for external examination?  I mean to say, you produce research output for at least 2 years and the University won't get you comments on your work, won't get your work out for external examination?</p>

                             <p>One thing you might say is 'well, I guess they prevented and prohibited you from completing the qualification'.  But then I go...  Well..  The entire time I was at the Australian National University I DID NOT SEE ANY STUDENT (NOT ONE) HAVE AN ORAL DEFENCE.  I DID NOT SEE ANY STUDENT WITH REPORTS FROM EXTERNAL EXAMINERS.  I mean to say...  They say that this person and that person and the next person is a PhD graduate of the Australiain National University...  But do they even have external examiners reports of their thesis?  Was it externally examined at all?  When was the oral defence scheduled?  How is it that they are claiming to have PhD's whereas I apparently or allegedly don't have one when they don't have anything that I don't have..  I mean to say..  Their work wasn't externally examined either.  Not so far as I can see...  Apparently their theses were accepted by the University without them having been examined at all.  'Their theses'.  Supposedly.  Allegedly.  Apparently.  And they've gone on to do independent work, have they?  Research output?  And allowed their students to work independently in turn?  Getting the work out for external examination?  Externally examining other studnents work?  For qualifications the students have actually been enrolled in etc? </p>

                             <p>Yeah, right.</p>

                             <p>So... I can provide the work that I did.  The work I have done.  During the time I was kept enrolled by various 'Universities'.  As the proof or evidence that I did the work.  And of course nobody will schedule an oral defence / interview because:  They know full well that I was the author of it.</p>

                             <p>Silly silly me..  I didn't think that enrolling in a Philosophy PhD meant that I had to 'choose sides' between Kim Sterelny and David Chalmers.  I actually thought that I was supposed to be working independently.  So I got on with doing my independent work.  Now, if they don't ask to see my work, else they don't provide written instructions to me on my work, then that isn't my problem. I don't see why it would be.  The very least they can do is get the work I've done in the first 2-3 years of my enrolment out for external examination.  Then the external examiners can write reports on the work and provide instructions of what needs to be done to it in that last year before they sign off.  There can be an oral defence where I have the opportunity to say that I don't want to make changes they suggest because I have thought about my topic more than I have (you would hope, when students are writing a doctoral degree) and I actually have something new to say or contribute.</p>

                             <p>What University ffs?  What a f*cking farce of a f*cking hoax of a f*cking scammy scam.  F*cking scum.  Mate.  It takes the work -- and it gets it to the external examiner.  The absolute f*cking minimum that the University was required to do.  And it won't do it.  ALl of these people on payroll...  No teaching.  Dave Chalmer's and Kim Sterelny had one f*cking job to do:  Supervise Graduate Research Students.  How many graduate research students did each of them have when I was their student?  How many words of research from their studnets were they supposed to be reading every year?  FFs.  How could it possibly be that hard?</p>

                             <p>So..  What am I supposed to say about what Univesrity qualifications I have?  I can say that I have written 2 masters theses (50,000 words) and one doctoral thesis (over 100,000 words - to allow external examiners some choice in which parts to axe).  I did the work.  I did it in a timely fashion.  And the various people on payroll to process the work that I did did not do the job for which they are paid.  It wasn't just me...  I didn't see Rachal Brown's external examiners reports.  Nick Southwood said that his externals accepted his thesis without any changes (I think he means to say the Uni told him that there weren't reports -- suggesting any changes).  They didn't have oral defences.  None of the other students had reports.  To the best of my knowledge.  None of them had oral defenses.  I never saw any student have an oral deence.  An oral examination.  By at least 2 external examiners who were not involved in the production of the work.  The Universities are refusing to get the work to externals.  What universities?</p>

                             <p>We are supposed to believe that Jacinda Ardern is a given an honorary degree (for reading teleprompts) and three fellowships with Harvard (when she did not even apply for one).  Seriously?  That's what a University looks like?  That's what it is or means to have an education?  Ashley Bloomfield is made Professor, now.  He didn't apply for or do the work for PhD or MD or any graduate research degree.  He doesn't have a research output.  Now he's going to...  What?  Not get his studnets work to external examiners.  Is he supposed to be externally examining students for qualifications he never enrolled in and never did the work for?  Is he supposed to be credited as the author of all the work in public health, now?  Just take from teh students and cross out their names and write in his name and he can have 3/4s of a million dollars per year...  To make daily appearances on TV while ordering the nation into unlawful lockdown.  So that they can make MORE MONEY!!! Off of international studnets applying for visa re re re re re re processing and re re re re re re enrollment in public health degrees?  </p>

                             <p>What the f*ck does it mean to have a PhD?  What a f*cking farce of a hoax of a joke of a scummy scam.</p>

                             <p>I think that anybody in NZ who has taken out a studnet loan..  Will know that they ask on your application for that if you are imprisoned (in which case you can't have one) or if you are bankrupt.  But now we are supposed to beleive that people in prison were enrolled in undergraduate and graduate level university qualifiaftions in NZ before they started doing distance education, even.  Yeah, right.  Sure.  Hey...  I know...  ALl you people out there who didn't have an education in NZ..  If only you can get a judge (pulled out of retirement for the occasion) to find you guilty of a crime you did not commit...  Then you can do NCEA and University qualifiations from your prison cell.  Does that seem legit?  </p>

                             <p>How low can we go?  Let's do a brainstorm...  Is it that we are very very bad at being good... Or that we are very very very very good at being bad?  What seems to be the most plausible expalantion,  here? What hint of 'try' do you see?  I mean, really.  What a f*cking joke.</p>
