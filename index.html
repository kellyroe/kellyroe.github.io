                                <p>
                                    Some of my Australian National University (ANU) student records have been made available to me:  <a href="judicial-review/anu-records.pdf" target="_self"> here. </a>  I have another few documents of records, also.  Apparently they have posted a physical copy to me so I am waiting for those to arrive.  I will then follow the next step of their disputes resolution process.  I am hoping that Australia (unlike New Zealand) values early resolution.  I don't know.  Is it acceptable for a University Department or a Supervisor to act as though their role or job is to prevent and prohibit a student from submitting a thesis for external examination by bullying the student away or trying to convince or persuade them to drop out and leave?  Is that something that makes the University better (on some understanding of the term)?  I likely would not have agreed to leave without my work having been sent out for external examination if I had have known that NZ Universities were not properly progressing applications to Medicine, in NZ (e.g., that they were throwing away applications from candidates who were high ranked enough for offer of place because they believe they have the right to arbitrarily determine 'eligibility').
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Anyway...
                                </p>


                                <p>
                                I have a phone conference scheduled mid-July with the Social Security Authority where I am asking them to reconsider the judgment that Work and Income will not assist anybody on a Work and Income Benefit with Security for Costs payments that have been demanded to be paid by the courts else the cases are deemed by the courts to have been abandoned.  It seems to me that justice has been denied to me in the various high court proceedings.  Forcing me to abandon the proceedings with the Court of Appeal on the grounds that I cannot afford to pay security for costs amounts to refusing access to justice to me on the grounds that I am poor.  Of course the Court of Appeal says that they are only asking the 'usual' security amount from me so as to 'not give beneficiaries an unfair advantage in litigation'.  They say that my cases against NZ Universities are not public interest cases -- which is obviously and clearly absurd.  How can it not be a matter of public interest that the public universities of New Zealand are refusing to process or progress applications, course progressions, course completions on their academic merits?  How can it not be a matter of public interest that the NZVCC who has statutory responsibility for disputes or complaints resolution refuses to acknowledge or progress any disputes or complaints?  How can it not be a matter of public interest that the Universities (and now the courts) refuse to accept that 1 year of research should only take 1 year to complete?  How can it not be a matter of public interest that the Universities force students to continued labor by withholding qualifications they have already met requirements for?  How can it not  be a matter of public interest that the Public Universities refuse to get students work to external examiners.  Not because they think that the external examiners will fail the studnet -- but because they think the external examiners will pass the student.  How can it not be a matter of public interest that New Zealand Universities think that their job, function, purpose, or point, is to withhold qualification completions so as to, effectively, keep slaves and under pay or not pay at all their workers.  How is not not a matter of public interest that a 1 year degree with around $5,000 fees ends up being double-billed by the University routinely, reliably, as a matter of course?  How can it not be a matter of public interest that complaining about these things takes more than 4 years to resolve?  How can it not be a matter of international community interest that New Zealand refuses to enrol, progress, and acknowledge completion of the training of their workers?  How can it not be a matter of public interest that New Zealand functions as a slave or detention camp?

                                <p>With respect to Roe v University of Waikato Justice Toogood (pulled out of retirement for the occasion because that's what 'independence of the judiciary' means) asserts that they were entitled to refuse to get my thesis out for external examination on the grounds that I submitted it 'too early'.    The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications, however.  That is their job, function, role, purpose, point.  They define a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  
                            <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a>.  Justice Toogood was wrong to have asserted that I tried to complete the qualification 'early' or 'under-time'.  I tried to submit it so that the customary or standard 3 months of external examination and up to 10 weeks of minor changes (typos and grammar) could be fixed up so that the hardcopy could be lodged in the library at the 34 week mark.  That is not 'early'.  That is on time.  The Universities of New Zealand (also the judiciary) don't appear to know what it is or means to get work done on time.  They refuse to allow it.
                            </p>

                            <p>The University of Waikato offers a 120 point MPhil qualification.  That means it has been approved by the TEC as being 'right sized'.  The academic quality and integrity people, the NZVCC approved the qualification.  It is listed in the University Calendar.  I applied to be enrolled in it.  The University refuses to allow anybody to complete that qualification, however.  They believe they are entitled to require studnets to work for at least 12 months on their thesis before undergoing an external examination period of up to 3 months.  Since you are required to be enrolled at the end of the external examination period that means that if the examination period takes 3 months then you are required to be enrolled in and pay fees for an enrolment period of 12 months plus 3 months for a total of 15 months.  But it doesn't stop there.  They believe that if the external examiners say anything about changes needing to be made to the substance (e.g., a referene to be added, a section to be moved around) then they are entitled to require the studnet to re-enrol for an additional 6 months and also undergo another external examination period of up to 3 months.  That means another 9 months added.  Basically forcing the student to repeat the f*cking year.  They say that the outcome of what they like to call 'first examination' is always that the student is required to pay fees for another 9 months.  This is fairly inevitable.  That is to say, they offer the 120 point qualification with the expectation that students will end up working for at least 12 months plus 3 months plus 6 months plus 3 months for a total of 24 months (2 years).  What happens then depends a  bit on the university.  Waikato has this 'option' for the university administration whereby the studnet takes another 2 1/2 months to make minor changes.  Find another reference.  Move a comma.  Etc.  The University administration believe they have discretion to force this -- else they can say the studnet failed to meet their requirements and the qualification is withheld.  
                            </p>


                            <p>
                                I think it is important for international community to know that this is going on in NZ Universities.  The High Court was informed and they refused to put things right in a timely fashion.  They believe that this behavior is appropriate academic quality and integrity for NZ Universities.  This is partiuclarly important information for international studnets who may find their visas expiring (anad them required to leave the country without their degree).  I'm sorry.  New Zealand Universities seem to have decided that they are entitled to run this scam.  This is the scam they are running.  I have posted the evidence as to how they treated me.  You can see in teh courts judgments that the courts believe they are not treating me any differently from how they treat other studnets.  The courts also state that they do not think that this matter that I bring before the courts is a matter of public interest and they also think that the matter that I bring before the courts is one that I cannot win.  There are no merits to my case.  I also post about how I paid the fees associated with filing in the tenancy tribunal on a different matter.  The outcome was declared 'suppressed' by the courts.  That is to say, I paid the fees the court set without questioning or applying for consideration of exemption and even after receiving the filing fee money the courts refused to find in the interests of justice.  There does not appear to be precedent that paying the fees they demand will actually result in them processing or progressing things properly.  It is just more money for them, is all.
                            </p>

                            <p>Here is how much the Inland Revenue now says I owe the New Zealand Government for my 'Education' and 'Training' that are not acknowledged because New Zealand qualifications apparently expire 5 years post-graduation (well, not the Judges law degrees, apparently, but my qualifications have expired): 
  
                            <a href="judicial-review/ird-shot.pdf" target="_self"> $104,663.</a>

                            They have not provided a break-down of what courses they recorded me as having been enrolled in, in what year.  I have transcripts for some years that I will upload.  They acknowledge that I have completed BA(hons) and an MA (I can't tell whether they invoiced 1 year or 2 years or more of fees total for the MA - it looks to me from my transcript that they may have double-billed).  They refuse to acknowledge that I have completed anything since then.  They keep invoicing my student loan -- for courses that I never applied to be enrolled in (changing enrolment dates for more billings for them which make me look like I'm slow).  They take my research work, particularly, and give it to third parties without crediting me (or paying me).  
                            </p>

                            <p>The Education and Training Act 2020 (and previous iterations of the Act) all state that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible to be enrolled in whatever programme they apply to.  The Act states that when a programme is over-subscribed (more applicants than available places) then the University may use a selection criterion.  The University of Auckland published a selection criterion involving GPA, UMAT / UCAT, interview score.  They informed me that they were happy to use the grades from my previously completed qualifications -- so long as I completed a further qualification for the purposes of 'eligibility'.  They said that I was required to complete the MPhil for 'eligibility'.  But this is false.  As a domestic adult I was eligible all along.  THey were therefore required to apply tehir selection criterion to my application regardless of whether or not I had completed a qualification in the last 5 years.  They don't get to decide who is and who is not eligible.  The source of eligibility is the statute and not their discretion.  The University and the courts simply refuse to hear this.  They refuse to summarise this way of putting things or seeing things or stating things in their judgments.  THey refuse to accept my obviously correct characterisation of the issue. 
                            </p>

                            <p>Otago, too, thinks they get to decide what students they will enroll in what programme for whatever arbitrary (including discrimatory) reasons they want.  They don't believe that international standards apply to them or to their conduct.  Look at the choices they make (e.g., Dr Leeks).  The untrainable qualities that they value.
                            </p>

                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  They aren't progressing the filings. They are refusing to supply applications, refusing to process applications on their academic merits.  Apparently it isn't a matter of public interest how they pick and choose people to pass themsleves off as 'doctors' in our hospitals.
                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  Demanding me to pay more and more and more money to the courts else they force all my cases aborted, or abandoned.  <a href="judicial-review/sc-eyes.pdf" target="_self"> Here is the Judgement of the Supreme Court that I am attempting to appeal on the grounds that it is manifestly grotesquely unjust. </a>  It is like they have their eyes poked out.  Our highest court does not seem to have the conception of justice, at all.  It was the courts decision to delay Roe v University of Waikato proceedings until AFTER Roe v NZVCC and also until AFTER Roe v University of Auckland.  The Judge for Roe v NZVCC made all kinds of pronouncement in his judgment on the matter of Roe v University of Waikato.  That is to say instead of judging the issue he was supposed to be judging (the inaction of Chris Whelan in his capacity as CE of the NZVCC) he thought he would weigh in on whether or not I had done enough for completion of the MPhil Degree.  Clearly that is a matter of the Judge of a different case to decide!  The reasoning seems to be 'we don't choose you, Ms Roe.  If that means we declare you non-person criminal then that is what we do to justify the fact that we don't choose you'.  This country is not even pretending to be rule by law.  It runs on 'exceptions' or 'exemptions' only (that need to be begged, bribed, else stolen) so far as I can see.  The Supreme Court refused to appoint an aimicus to ensure there was no miscarriage of justice.  Refused to appoint a legal aid lawyer to help me with my filings (when I contacted everyone listed for civil on the the civil Legal Aid list and nobody would file the paperwork to help me with any of the cases).  Apparently our Legal Aid system is working.  Who is it working for?  It is working for who?  We do not appear to have a functioning judiciary (tertiary education system, health system).  Where does all the money go?  Apparently they would rather pay 'recruitment officers' and 'marketers' to make it look like we are wanting to hire other things and just continually re-advertise and re-market positions with no actual intention of filling them with paid workers, at all.  This is not a developed nation.  It is too corrupt.
                            </p> 

                            <p>
                            It seems to me that the Australian Constition explicitly states that New Zealand is regarded, by them, to be a State of the Federation of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  Australia refuses to honor it's own Constitution.  New Zealand seems to function as a detention camp of Australia only.  That is how the NZ Government chooses to keep the people of New Zealand.
                            </p>

                            <p>Here are  <a href="judicial-review/sup-court-waikato.pdf" target="_self"> My Filings </a>to the Supreme Court regarding the University of Waikato    
                            </p>

                            <p>Una Jagose doesn't seem to have the job of instructing Crown Law to prosecute corruption within New Zealand Universities, or within the Judiciary (where judges refuse to accept evidence and where the supreme court punishes people for bringing injustices before the courts).  It seems there is no evidence that they will accept that would attest to corruption.  None of the invoicing information that I provided (e.g., 0.5 EFTS = 120 points = 60 points = indefinate enrolment).  They appear to have complete freedom to do anything they want with impunity.  Our Universities are nothing other than slave or detention camps designed to waste time only by delaying people until they die.  This is not the developed world.  <p> <a href="judicial-review/crown-law.pdf" target="_self"> Blow off response. </a>

Here's how it goes.  I file against the ADHB.  They order a case management conference.  They say I need to revise and resubmit my filings.  Never stop paying the courts.
