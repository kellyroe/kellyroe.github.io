 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>So I Just read a news article that claimed Ashley Bloomfield just made Professor at the Univesrity of Auckland.  I am confused, though, because my understanding was that he was a 'Doctor' in virtue of a MBChB (which is listed in the World Medical School Directory as an undergraduate level qualification) and he does not have a PhD, or an MD.  That is to say he is not an academic and / or research doctor at all.  </p>

                                <p>They must have meant to have said that he chose to give up his three quarters of a million dollar salary per year in order to study for his PhD or MD because he *wanted* or *aspired* to be made Professor one day.  That's the only sense I can make of it.  I mean he doesn't have a PhD.  He doesn't have teaching or tutoring or grading experience.  He doesn't have publications.  Does he?  Apparently he has a Masters Level Qualification.  I don't know if it was a coursework Masters or a Research Masters.  If it was a 120 point Research Masters Degree completed over at least 2 academic years (and one summer school period) or something else...  I don't know how many weeks of enrolment they recieved for having him enrolled...  I wonder if he is full fee paying or if they gave him a scholarship.  Will his sons still be living with him and his wife in their 1 bedroom apartment living in University of Auckland Accommodation?</p>

                                <p>Just think how amazing it will be for him, decades from now.  When (if) he makes Professor.  He will be all, like, 'well, people didn't really understand why I would give up a three quarters of a million dollar civil servant salary in order to follow my dream..  But I made personal sacrifies to study for my PhD with the University of Auckland...  ANd then I worked on my doctoral thesis for years and years and years..  ANd I was soooooo scared that they might simply choose not to get my work out to external examiners at all because it would be so much cheaper for the government to require me to reenroll and reenroll and reenroll and reenroll rather than paying me three quarters of a million dollars per year to have an actual government paid position.  And then I got casual work within the university tutoring and grading.  Eventually I got my PhD and tenrure.  Publications.  And then associate professor.  And then, finally, the capstone of my career I was made Professor.  And all the sacrifices I made seemed worthwhile'.  I guess that's something to look forward to, eh Ashley?  A sort of reward or capstone on all the hard work you did working away on your PhD over however many years.  The sacrifices you made living in University Accommodation and living off a graduate stipend or some form or sort of government allowance.  Are you really going to enrol with the Univeristy of Auckland because you want to make Professor, Ashley?  When does your enrolment start?  Who is your supervisor?  Do you think they will get your work out to externals any time within the next 10 years?</p>

                                <p>Apparently there is some lady in England who has worked as a Psychiatrist for the last 15 + years, or something.  I am not sure why they are choosing to go after her now.  I suppose they are supposed to pay her and they don't want to pay her so instead they accuse her of being a hoax or a fraud.  Anyway, Auckland is saying she doesn't have a MBChB.  But, of course, various people who don't work in Medicine and don't get paid to do any Medical work are acknowledged by Auckland as having MBChB's.  Ashley Bloomfield, for example.   I suppose they acknowledge his MBChB because he is not registered to practice Medicine.  Ayesha.  The guy from Hamilton.  Shane Reti?  Agrees to work minimum hours to keep up his registration only.  No more than minimum hours.  Do they pay him to do that or...  How does that work?  His patients can literally only see him if they agree to see him only during 1 or 3 weeks of every year?</p>

                                <p>I don't see how it is possible for someone to forge their way onto the class roll.  The cadavar laboratory (every laboratory) has a class roll that lists all the studnets who are enrolled in the class so the teaching staff can check that only people who are supposed to be in the class are in fact in the class.  It is not plausible to think that it is possible to forge your way onto the class roll.  Likely what happened was that when it was time to pay this guy...  They would rather pretend they never heard of him.  They would rather say they don't acknowledge his qualifications anymore.  They simply refuse to pay the workers.</p>

                                <p>During the Labor Governments most recent first term they stopped paying the teachers in the schools.  Said that it was an Australian Payroll Systems error or problem.  THey did not acknowledge that the teachers in the schools had graduated.  They refused to pay them.  The last thing Harlene Hayes did on her way from Otago to her position in Western Australia was fail at least 1/3rd of the Medical class.  They said that they did not acknowledge that they had completed their internships.  They had signed forms saying that they completed their internships.  But the University said they refused to accept that.  THey were not going to graduate them.  They could go into their positions as Junior Doctors and work for the DHB's in the hospitals.  But they would not pay them.  THey would need to keep paying the University for continued re-enrolment in the MBChB qualification.</p>

                                <p>New Zealand (and Australia) do not have education and training systems. They have prison slave detention camps.  Certain people are picked out all Stanford Prison Experiiment like to be in the position of oppressor and certain other people are picked out to be the oppressed.  And there is a system of prison slave or detention camps up and down the land.  PUnative insittutions of abuse.  The research output  of Manus Island was likely greater than the research output of the English Department at the University of Waikato.  It doesnt' matter whether someone manages the schools prisons hospitals universities aged care facilities early childhood care facilieies..  They are all the same.  Right Chris Hipkins?  The pipeline of abuse. By those employed by government to be abusers. </p>

                                <p>Whatever will Ashley Bloomfield be redeployed to next?  Supreme Court Judge?  Did he ever apply to Law School?  Don't worry, the University of Auckland can just say that they found an online transcript for him recording that he has his JD.  PhD.  They found a thesis with his name on it in their e-library.  I guess he probably pays them?  Right?  IN order to do anything anything anything anything anything with impunity?  How many teenage virgins will they record as having been enrolled in Ashley Bloomfields terminal masters programme, then?  Graduation scheduled for never.</p>

                                <p>I am going to talk about Carl Brusse because if I talk about how they treated me people seem very keen to make it personal and personally attack me.  So that is why I am talking about Carl.  Kim Sterelny boasted about keeping him enrolled for..  For  how long did the Australian National University keep him enrolled before they acknowledged him as having 'done enough' for a PhD?  I think I remember Kim Sterelny boasting about him being enrolled for 10 years.  But why stop there?  What they do is they move your supervisor to a different university when it is around time for your work to be sent to externals.  Then everybody tells you how garbage and rubbish and crap you are and your topic is and so on.  It doesn't really matter how they go about bullying and abusing people keeping them enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and reendolled.  I thought that it was about standing up to the bullies.  For example, instead of waiting for your supervisor to say 'okay, get it to externals now' or 'make these changes then send it out' you just hand it in.  Despite or in spite of them.  Not at all because of them.  But I posted my thesis via track and trace to teh University and still they said that they didn't acknowledge it because I needed to submit it in person (why think that).  They said I addressed it to thte wrong person (I did not).  It is beyond bullying and having people on and misleading them and so on. It's outright corruption.  They will not get theses to external examiners specifically because they want to collect up more and more and more money for having the studnet enrolled and reenrolled and reendolled and reenrolled.</p>

                                <p>New Zealand constantly cries about how we don't have enough skilled workers.  But we are refusing to graduate studnets who have met the requirements of qualifications because we don't want to pay anybody to work skilled jobs.  Ashley Bloomfield does not have any acdaemic publications but they say he is Professor now.  It is a slave hostage prison detention camp.  It cannot claim to be a University at all.  They will not get studnets work out to external examiners.  They will not allow them to sign teh studnets off.  THey will not graduate people who have met requirements for qualifications.  They will not hire only the people who have met requirements for the qualifications.  I suppose they collect up more and more and more money for people applying and reapplying and reapplying for visas and so on.  But very very bad people live here.  THey are not conducting themselves with any honesty or integrity at all.  They are not supplying applications to enrol, they are not handling applications to enrol properly.  THey throw away some applications in order to preferentially enrol the teenager children of the adminisntration, for example.  They are not acknowledging progression through the curriculum.  They won't employ people qualified to teach the curriculum.  They often don't really have curriculum contents.  They aren't fairly grading or examining or tracking academic progress.  They aren't really an academic institution.  They aren't graduating.  They expect studnets to hand over more and more and more money, they collect up more and more and more money from the government for keeping the studnet enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled.  Prison slave detention camp.  There is nothing here.  No doctors.  No lawyers.  No engineers.  No professors.  NO judges.  No skilled laborers or workers.  Slaves.  Hostages.  The governmetn appears to be fundamentally corrupt.  COrrupt through and through.  There' snothing here.  Nobody home.</p>
