                            <p> https://www.nzherald.co.nz/kahu/the-investment-into-maori-apprentices-has-turned-around-maori-unemployment-youre-hired/4NEY2WL5RNAQ5KJ2OSEYM7IZGE/  Do the apprentices get paid minimun wage for every week of their apprenticeship?  Or do the 'apprentices' have levels of debt recorded against their name, with the Inland Revenue Department?  The Government is paying the training provider to keep them as hostages.  Prisoners.  Detainees.  Slaves.  They aren't paid minimum wage for the work that they do -- are they?  Are they paid minimum wage?  How many decades are they supposed to do their 'apprenticeship'  before they are graduated from their qualifications so that they can go into their minimum wage paying jobs?  What education and training system?  You don't pay the workers.  You pay the slavers to keep slaves.  How are they unemployed when they don't make minimum wage for the work that they do?  What workforce? What economy?  </p>

                            <p>Helen Nicolson announced that she understood the concerns of her staff and that she and anybody earning over $100,000 per annum would be exercising pay restraint and that the retirement age would be enforced.  SOme people had had government payroll for 40+ years.  If they still couldn't function in the private sector no more government payroll for them.  Time to retire.  Stand down ffs.  No.  She didn't.  She says she doesn't get enough for each hostage for her to pass on to each hostage so much as a minimum wage.  What education and training programme?    What University?  How many graduate research students are acknowledged as having completed 120 points of study in 1 year?  How many 360 point graduate research students are acknowledged as having completed 360 points of study in 3 years?  What law grads? What medicine grads?  What engineering grads? What skilled workers?  What University?  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camp. It's sooooo competitive. Only over Helen's dead  body. </p>

                            <p>Australia and New Zealand have never met obligations to refugees.  NZ and Australia are goverened, still, as prison, slave, detention camps.  It doesn't make any sense to the people who have been appointed leaders that people come here for refuge.  People are supposed to flee from this region for refuge.  Nobody comes to these lands to seek refuge.  They come fleeing the laws of overseas.   All the PGY3 people should apply to be medical doctors in Australasia.  ALl the ones who weren't matched to train and work in the UK or US or Canada.  ALl the ones they didn't want.  We would  love to take all the ones they didn't want and bully and abuse them.  Put them to 'work' for no pay.  Tell them how garbage garbage garbage and crap they are.  We will have things no other way.  Locals need not apply.  Justice Toogood says that they can just enrol and not enrol and graduate and not graduate and just do anything they want.  Right Ashley?  If you put the kids on ventilators and breathe for them they will breate exactly how you think they should.  That would be a good job for you -- right?  I'm sure you know better than they how their mental health should be managed.   </p>

                            <p>Punative only.</p>

                            <p>It takes a lot of work to get the buy-in where Professor Glue's Glue Factory is the only game in town.  They should get the law guy who they only graduated from law because he likes to stick pins and pencils in infants...  THey should give him the job defending the Law Society's decision to preferentially register him and other people similarly willing to work the job for low to no pay.  They could pay him more than 100,000 per year to say that they didn't receive any applications to Law, to graduate from Law, to be registered with the law society..  No applications were acknowledged as received..  Except applications from him and people like him.. Who are given second chances only because they think they will go on to persecute on behalf of the government.  Government prosecution.  Guffaw.  Government persecution.  Join the Government persecutors.  Get paid more and more and more (your earning potential is unlimited limitless) depending on your capaciaty to persecute.  Chris will give you $400 a fortnight, was it Chris?  For keeping another as 'apprentice-slave'. ALl you need is to just keep sending information to the IRD that this, that, and the other has been re re re re re re re enrolled in your apprentice training programme.  Justice Toogood can't see anything wrong with that. </p>
