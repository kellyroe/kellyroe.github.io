                            </p>

                            <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/homed/latest/132983670/who-owns-new-zealands-first-state-house-still-going-strong-at-86  And my mid-career starting salary is.... Uh...  F*cking hell.  I mean, seriously? </p>

                            <p>I suppose I should upload a list of all the NZ goverment paid positions that I've applied for via Seek else NZ government (govt.nz) websites.  All the cover letters that I hand over re re re re re re re re re re applying for positions with slightly different cover letter so I can re re re re re re re re re re apply for, basically, the same position.  What's that Jo?  You never need worry about being out of work, as a contractor, they always make up something for you.  So you can keep however many dependents across however many rental properties.  Of course.  Mates rates rents (they never could afford to live there otherwise) so that the landlord laws don't apply to you.  Good to know how you get payrolled.  Lucky, lucky, you!</p>
                                  

                                   <p>This is the Real Me.  As opposed to the igovt, one can only suppose.  As opposed to the myequals.  How much does it cost me to see what false records you are keeping and trying to pass off as my transcripts, these days?  Can I see the reports from the people payrolled to supervise me?  The ones whose income is kept dependent on my being kept dependent.  More and more and more money for keeping me.  Keeping me poorly.  So that they can live in the manner (manor) in which they have  become accostomed.  (my - equals - get it?? Haha!)     </p>

                                   <p>Did I do enough in 1 year to get my MA with the University of Waikato?  Why did they record my being enrolled with them in that programme (a 120 point programme only) for 2 years?  Compare the work I did in 1 year with other students who had done the work for 1 year.  Did I do enough in 3 years to get my PhD with the ANU?  Compare the work I did in 3 years with the work of other students who had worked for 3 years.  Compare the work I did in 3 years with the work others did in 3 years when they were given their PhD.  Did I do enough for entry to MBChB with Otago in 2010?  Take a look at the people they chose to enrol.  The children of the administration, was it?  What are they doing now?  Did they graduate?  Any of them?  I suppose there is that... </p>

                                   <p>
                                How hard is it supposed to be to get into Medical School, in NZ?  3x as many applicants as there are number of places in the programme, apparently.  Okay, so you might need to apply 2 or 3 or 4 times.  How hard is it supposed to be?  How hard could it possibly be?  It's soooo competitive that Dr Leeks was the only game in town.  That's how hard it is, to get into Medical School, in NZ.  How hard is it to be a doctor, generally?  I mean, Medicine aside.  How hard can it possibly be to complete a PhD?  It's how many years worth of work?  By people who did well enough in their undergraduate years etc for them to be trafficked about the world so that they can collect up more and more and more and more and more research output for them.  More and more and more money for the NZ government.  More and more money.  Re re re re re enrolment.  More money.  More work output.  More re enrolment money.  Best pay for visa re re re re processing, everybody.  So that you can give over more and more and more work.  Re re re re re enrolment fees.  The 'Universities' need more money.  So they can give payrises to the Administration.  So they can re re re re re process more and more applications.  Take more and more work and re attribute authorship to their own children etc.  What a f*cking scam.  Best haul the 'judges' out of retirement to order re re re re filings for the courts.  Best keep paying filing and re filing and re re re filing fees.  For re re re re hearings.
                            </p>

                            <p>Wh wh wh wh wh wh wh wh what's that D D D D D David Lumsden?  Are you dead yet?
                            </p>

                            <p>At least we have all the psychiatrists whom Dr Leeks thought should be signed off as psychiatrists.  So that all his good works could continue on.  It's not like what he was doing was any different from what anybody else on payroll was doing.  Right?  Most valued and valuable employee who had to be moved to Melbourne once the people of the South Island of NZ realised what he was.  They had to set him up with payroll sufficient to enable his ongoing crimes against the people of Melbourne.  Only psychiatrist they would payroll.  Only person they would accept was a psychiatrist.  Wouldn't sign off on the qualification for anybody else.  Nobody else need apply.  Only game in town.</p>

                            <p>How's Professor Glue's Glue Factory coming along?  Is it everything those who appointed him into the position wanted for it to be?  The vision for psychiatry, in NZ.  One we can export to Australia.  Australia seems to value that.  Chose to import Harlene Hayes for all the good work she did re re re re structing the 'University' of Otago.  Set her up in Western Australia so she can take re re re re enrolments for Medicine, over there.  From the 18 year old children of the Administration.  Set them up so they can go collect cervical samples etc from the Aboriginals.  Nobody else need apply.  They are going to need to get in there and have a go when they are 18.  The prostate and cervical examinations.  Breast examinations.  Scoping the colon.  Important medical examinations underway.  Giving people as many x-rays as they can to induce as many cancers as they can.  Pushing endometrial cells from the uterus up the fallopian tubes with scopes.  Perforating the tubes.  Seeding the cells in the abdominal cavity.  Get in there!  Have a go!  Fake it till ya make it!  Then they'll never be able to get rid of you!  Only over  your dead bodies, hey!</p>

                            <p>
                            The people have been volunteered!  They have been consented.  The consents have  been obtained.  The people have been volunteered!  Manufacturers liabilty has been waived!  The NZ government will tell the people what they have  been consented to.  What they have been consented for.  Perhaps.  Or maybe they will just keep 2 faced records.  The farcebook or face-arse book the front facing book and the f*ck you up the arse book.  The Dr Leeks is (back end) only psychiatrist in town book.  The there is no alternative.  Nobody else need apply.  Send all your expired medical products all the ones that failed the quality inspections to NZ.  Liability waived.  They don't have a functioning judiciary.  All the 'judges' pulled out of retirement for the occasion to not see anything wrong.  When do they retire?  What's that?  The only remedy is removal from office but since they're supposed to be retired already there is no remedy.  Only over their dead bodies, hey.  They will have things no other way.
                            </p>

                            <p>At least they'll get the Medical care they deserve.  All the migrant 'healthcare assistants' that they won't pay.  They'll have to sell their organs, or something.  Take videos of them and sell them on the You Tubes.  Pimp them out for profits.  There's really nothing there.  Hey.  They'd have things no other way.</p>
