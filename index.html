                            <p> https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/surgeon-chief-doc-with-drug-abuse-history-prescribed-tramadol-for-family-used-it-himself/DFM7MD5VP5BRLASQ4Z4XT4L3AI/  Let me guess -- they only went after him now because  he's over the age of 65.  They granted him name supression to protect him so that it is easier for him to continue practicing in Melbourne or Sydney or Brisbane.  How many of his studnets were thrown out of Medical Training because they tried to report him?  It's sooooooooo competitive!  It's sooooooooooo competitive!!!!!  It's soooooo competitive - it's like there simply isn't a health system, at all!!! </p>

                            <p>Hey Des Gorman.  How old are you?  Time to go, mate.  Stand down.  Give someone else a turn.  People are pretty sick and f*cking tired of hearing you talk about 'human nature' of yourself and your f*cking cronies.  Alllll of the research funding for Des.  Mooooore money for Des.  More prestige, too.  Pooooor Des.  He's feeling under-valued...  Most of the costs of medical care are early on.  So, if ACC can delay the claim then ACC can keep the costs down.  Instead of people getting ACC funding to go into private hospitals etc the funding approval is held up so people go through the public system.  So the claims are delayed and ACC laughs all the way to the bank.  Very clever.  Not any good.  But very very clever.  Des was paid by ACC.  Wasn't he?  He testifies, doesn't he, about how various conditions aren't occupational.  They aren't anything to do with people's occupations.  He testifies in court.  So that ACC denies the claims.  He does everything he can to deny treatment for people who need treatment.  Does Des.  He doesn't do any clinical work, though, does he?  Does he actually see patients?  Is he actually registered?  Microchipped?  All that?  No...  He just testifies, doesn't he, to try and do everything he can to prevent and prohibit people from having medical treatment that they need so that ACC can laugh all the way to the bank.  Doesn't he.  Doesn't he do that?  And the University has a special place for him in their heart that he can preach to the next generation about how to prevent and prohibit people from having the treatments they need so that ACC can laugh all the way to the bank.  That's why Des is payrolled.  Isn't he?  How old is Des?  What is he still doing on payroll?  I don't think we can afford to keep you around, Des.  Are you 65?  Time to retire, mate.  Give someone else a f*cking go, alright?  You've had how many years...  How many years?  Look at the state of the health system, will you?  Stand down, mate.  Enough, already.  There's nothing really left, eh.  F*ck off.  Get out.  Comprehend.  Aye?? </p>

                            <p>Des is the guy who stands  before the courts and says there is no evidence that smoking causes cancer or that alcohol causes harm to first timester foetus'.  He's the guy who says these things with a straight face.  He's the guy who doesn't see that any complaint is, or could be, the result of work exposure.  It's really important that Medical Doctors serve the corporations and government trying to withhold treatment.  That's the only reason why they chose  him for training and employment.  Think of all the wonderful studies that need to be done.  How many cigarettes and how much alchohol needs to  be force fed to rats and the like -- in the name of helping medical research.  All the occupational exposures.  Exposure to x-rays and nuclear bombs and so on doesn't cause cancer.  Course not.  Quickly quickly quickly all the money for Des, now, so he can do a longitudinal study on handicapping, sickening, killing some group.  Quickly quickly quickly now.  All of the money for Des!!!  Such a credit to medical science research!  Such a beacon of sickness and disease.  How old are you Des?  65+ -- time to get the f*ck out.  SOrry your math no work-y no more.  TIme to go.  What's so hard to  understand?  </p>

                            <p> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stranger_(Camus_novel)  and indeterminacy of translation regarding intent. </p>

                            <p>  At least some of the hold up with the judiciary is nothing at all to do with lawyers.  My filings have been  held up and we aren't waiting on my lawyer, that's for sure.  What is the hold up?  Sometimes it is the judge.  Not producing the judgment in a timely fashion.  Sometimes it has to do with the content of the judgment.  Instead of judging the case that was brought before the courts - judging the case that one wishes had been brought before the courts.  Sometimes the judges order re re re re filings until they have altered the case from one they can't / won't judge to one that they feel okay about.  Amicus curiae could be appointed to help the court.  Friend to the court.  A lawyer being appointed to write an amicus brief to help the court ensure that justice is done or upheld particularly when one of the parties is (though no fault of their own) unrepresented.  But do the judges have the power to appoint an amicus?  Do the judges have the power to remove from office?  Impeachment.  It is in the rule book...  But then I think there is also an age of retirement for judges..  The laws don't seem to apply to those judges...  I wonder why that is...  </p>

                            <p>I love it when Google tries to teach me what a bicycle is.  I'm like 'yeeeees Google, whatever you say, Google, can you progress the form submission now?  Pretty pretty please?'</p>

                            <p>I don't really get what the end game or plan is.  The idea is to hire pedophiles and rapists and murderers and sexual offenders and assaulters and abusers and so on into the teaching and medical and so on...  Instead of a military.  Is that the ideal?  You don't need to worry about a military (to be used against the people) you can just sic the psychiatrists and doctors and teachers and lawyers etc onto them. All the governmetn employees.  The ones you choose to payroll.  In spite of..  No despite..  No, actually precisely BECAUSE of them being known offenders.  Most desirable people to be on government payroll ever.  Must have.  Dr Leeks.  All the qualities that were valued for psychiatry.  In NZ.  And then in Melbourne.  Must have.  Nobody else wanted to do it.  Nobody else was willing to do it.  For the NZ and then Australian Government.  Must have.  Something something about 'bring the people with you'.  But that doesn't seem to be what the government is doing, at all.  The government seems to think it's job is to bully and abuse and violate the people.  That really seems to be the thing of it.  Evidence to the contrary?  </p>

                          

                            <p>I haven't really been following the trial regarding the 10 day Orthopedic hire's wife.  I never really was interested in watching 'special victims unit', or shows like that.  Voyerism.  Something.  I'm not a person who drives slower to look at the train wreck.  </p>

                            <p>Quite a lot of people snap.  When it comes to kids.  They don't know what to do or how to make them stop.  Get them to stop.  Screaming or crying or whatever.  So people shake them or bash their heads into something or throw them or smother them.  To get them to stop.  Because they can't hear themselves think and they need a break.  They don't know what to do to get them to stop.  And they need them to stop.  They need a break.</p>

                            <p>Sounds like lots of people are willing to testify that she was saying that she wasn't coping and she needed help.  I mean, if someone says 'hey, I'm thinking of killing my kids' and the world goes...  Whatever.  I mean...  Did her husband not earn enough money for him to hire her some home help?  Someone to help with the cooking or washing or cleaning or household chores?  Someone to help her babysit or entertain the kids? Whether she is there with them or whether she gets to leave the house for a bit and have some me time.  Go out to dinner with her husband and his work colleages.  He didn't think that she needed him home with her, right now.</p>

                            <p>I'm not excusing.  I'm explaining. </p>

                            <p>This whole 'not guilty by reason of insanity' thing to decide whether she gets to go to prison for a long time or a psychiatric institution for a long time.  That's psychiatry.  Not a medical thing.  But then most of medicine isn't a medical thing, either.  Giving people their euthanasia shots and surgically removing things the patient never consented to and...  Only treat the involuntary non-voluntary non-consenting.  WHen people ask for help that's just a sign of weakness for you to play on their weakness and do everything you can to try and help them get to their breaking point.  So then you can sit back and watch the SVU show.  What health system?  </p>

                            <p>What law system?  To the best of my understanding the only people they payroll to criminal defence tell the clients that they can sign the confession and they'll go to a nicer prison and be treated nicer and be out in 6 months.  Else they can refuse to sign the confession in which case they will go somewhere worse, be treated worse, and not get to before a judge for at least a year.  What justice system?  What judiciary?</p>

                            <p>Apparently the fact that she killed the kids is not something that anybody (even her lawyer) is questioning.  Is it?  I mean to say...  Did the police investigate, at all, whether maybe he killed the kids?  Whether maybe some other employee of Canterbury District Health Board did?  Did people from South Africa identify the kids bodies properly?  Are they really dead?  Etc.  Did the police look into anybody else regarding the situation or incident?  I mean..  How  much money would you have to pay corrupt officials in NZ to get to dump your wife at HIllmorton and be made bachelor again?  These sorts of questions...  Alternative situations.  Scenarios.  Why?  Because that's reasonable doubt.  And it is the lawyers job to do everything they can (within the law) to create reasonable doubt.  But they aren't doing that, are they?  The question or issue for the trial is whether she was psychotic or not so whether she goes to jail (where she will be treated horribly, I'm sure) or whether she gets to stay in Hillmorton where they could treat her better.  In which case she is required to plead psyhosis under the instruction of her psychiatrist.  I think her psychiatrist was the one who initially said that she should not appear before the court at all because that wasn't in her interests?  </p>

                            <p>What psychiatry?  I mean to say...  NOt a branch of  medicine...  Hey.  But then Medicine isn't really medicine either.  I mean you force the involuntary non-consenting to not prosecute for sexual violation and removal of organs and more and more and more and more crimes.  Basically.  Needle stick injuries.  And so on.  Drugging people against their will.  What health system?  I mean it's not like psychiatry is doing anything any worse than the rest of medicine.  Right?  </p>

                            <p>The anti-psychiatrists were themselves psychiatrists.  Szasz and others.  They were (if you actually read them) most often saying that there could or would be no psychiatry insofar as it was about involutary incarceration and so on.  WHen the patients were kicking and screaming for the tortures and abuses of them to stop.  The ones being carried out by the 'doctors' I mean to say.  They were saying that the present state of Psychiatry in NY and so on was concerning.  But the way things have gone the rest of medicine did everything they could to be more and more and more like psychiatry.  Involuntary lock downs and needle sticks and forced ventillation (let's hook 'em up 6 at a time) to ventillators.  Let's see how much damage we can do the lungs and really force the virus in down there deep...  Only treat those who have been drugged into not being able to run away...  What health system?</p>

                            <p> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-psychiatry  Abolition of FORCED psychiatry.  But then the rest of medicine got all 'meeeee tooooo' about it.  That's not fair that psychiatry gets to force 'treatments' on the involuntary non-voluntary non-consenting.  Meeeee tooooo. In the name of Covid!!  Helping me helping me helping me help myself to you.  Who is asking for help?  No help for you!  But thanks for identifying yourself as a vulnerable target for abuse.  Who doesn't want help?  Go get 'em boys!!!  Sic em!  Get in there!  Off to the glue factory for you!!! </p>

                            <p>What is of course most important is that the psychiatrists get to spend all their time in court providing expert opinion on how this that and the other person is that that or the other variety of crazy therefore must  be sentenced to stay with them in their institution and be subject to their expert treatment.  Voluntariliy, of course.  You can go off to prison and be double bunked with someone and see how long you last there before you voluntariliy decide to off yourself in state care..  Or you can go off to the NZ governmetn psychiatric hospital.  'hospital'.  Full of non-voluntary non-consenting patients.  Where the psychiatrist has unlimited abiltiy to write prescriptiosn against the patiens will or arrange for them to have revoluntary new treatments like ketamine or have their nasal polyps all fixed up (which, I imagine, is some kind of a euphemism for putting a suction device or similar up there and performing some kind of frontal lobe labotomy).  What health system?  Oh, didn'dt you know?  People don't have the right to refuse to participate in medical experimetns or medical trials or observational studies of how many people die untimely deaths of this that and the other thing.  ONly studies that would get governmetn funding, in fact!  Only application they acknoweldged as having received!!!  Only game in town!!</p>

                            <p>There is just not enough money in the world for everyone to have the health or mental health treatment that they want.  The things they are asking for, that they identify that they need.  Rather, all the money must be spent on things nobody ever asked for (all the abuses against the involuntary non-volntary non-consenting).  By teh time we have spent all the money on teh abuses against the iinvoluntary non-voluntary non-consenting tehy have been volunteered there simply isn't enough money left for anything else!  There isn't anything else to psychiatary, in NZ.  There isn't anythign there!  In fact.  What psychiatary?  Oooooh.  That's only for the worst of the worst of the worst of the 2 percetn of the worst of the worst, they say.  ANd of course other people decide when and if psychiatry is right fo ryou.  YOu've been signed up for a Dr Leeks observational study on how to get the little boys sexually responding to adult men etc etc.  The inhumane.  Inhumanity of it all.  What Medicine?  There isnt' anything there...  Nobody else applied!  It's sooooooo competitive!!!!!  It's sooooo competitive!!!!  </p>

                            <p>How much of the courts time is this taking up?  Weeks and weeks and weeks to hear if she's going off to the psych detention facility else staying the prison detention facility.  This is not the appearance of justice, at all.  It is the appearance of injustice.  It is not informing the public about psychiatry at all.  It is informing the public about how and why there isn't any psychiatry, in NZ.  Too busy swarming like vultures over and abotu the involuntary.  Too little too late.  Never enough to go around.  Bullying and abusive.  Bullyhing and abusive.  Bullying and abusive.  Will not have things any other way.  Revelling and delighting in the bullying and abuse.  It isn't entertaining.  It is really quite grotesque.  ANd completely and utterly inhumane.  WHere is the compensation for the victims of abuse in state care?  How much money was spent on this sh*t show?  How many NZers were denied places in quarantine (including pregnant ones) to expediate 5 south africans through in the name of urgency emergency nobody else from NZ could possibly work his job for 10 days.  Then it goes back to being unfilled- right.  We would have things no other way.</p>

                            <p>--</p>

                            <p>If anybody knows one thing about Philosophy it is 'the unexamined life is not worth living'.  So what does that say, then, when people refuse to allow you to sit external examinations?  When people refuse to allow your academic work to be externally examined on the basis of the academic merits of the academic work?  What does that say, then?  It says that various people have decided that your life is not worth living.  What does that mean, then, for the value of their life?  What value does their life have, what value should their life have, when they proclaim that yours is not worth living?  I think someone has announced that their lives should not be worth living.  When people choose to use their power to prevent other people from having lives they consider worth living.  F*cking die.  Stupid f*cking idiots.  F*cking die, mate.  Your life isn't worth living.  Die, aready.  F*cking hurry up and die.  Time to go.</p>

                            <p>What a f*cking train wreck.  Nobody is going to vote.  THen they will just fake it.  Have the Mongrel Mob, or whomever, fill out the voting papers.  Just f*cking lie about it.  Whatever.  The people aren't going to vote.  Because they know it's a farce.  A scummy hoax.  A F*cking scam.  Like the Judicary if a f*cking hoax.  A F*cking farce.  A F*cking scam.  LIke our education system is a f*cking farce.  A F*cking hoax.  A F*cking scam.  There really isn't anything there, at all.  What justice? What healthcare?  What judiciary?  What election?  What educationa nd training system?  What a f*cking farce.  Hoax.  Scam.  Can't even kepe accurate records of enrolment.  Graduation.  Can't even bill the IRD correctly.  Can't even won't even process applications for employment.  What parliament?  There isn't anything there ffs.  What a f*cking fare of a f*cking hoax of a f*cking scam.  You are supposed to hire the people most qualified.  Not so much as an interview.  What could *most qualified* possibly mean?  F*cking retards.  F*cking imbecels.  There isnt' anyting there.  NO suprises on why there aren't any nuclear submarines (or anything else).  F*cking idiots.  Nobdody can function, hey.  F*cking idiots.  Nobody is allowed to function.  Hey.  F*cking idiots.  No people.  Hey.  I don't see any people.  What people do you see?  What people?  I don't see any people.  Just psychopaths and slaves.</p>

                            <p> https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/nz-led-study-social-isolation-can-age-your-brain-faster/YRE6TMQNMNGWFCYYO7LU32PDHM/  Aw.  It's very very disappointing.  So much more work needs to be done (so much more needs to be funded) so we can really murder people before their time.  Really kill them.  I mean we can keep them behind glass.  In teh aged care institutions.  in the childcare institutions.  In the hospitals.  In the orthopedics wards.  Everything we can to reduce immune system function and prevent and prohibit wound healing.  Everything we can.  Everything we can.  It's soooo competitive.  Doing everything everything everything we can to age the brains faster...  Not quite there yet.  But you understand the research priorities.  Die!  Die!  Die!!  We are doing everything we can do.  Both within NZ and internationally.  Really doing everything we can do to prvent and prohibit and delay and hold up and obstruct... </p>

                            <p>Wow.  It's so amazing that POE is a NZ thing.  A NZ company.  All the job adverts that there are for people to work there.  Rocketlab.  Les Mills.  Fisher and Paykal (conmunications).  Marketing.  Why not start a start up?  Then declare yourself bankrupt.  There's a good pawn now.  Why not marry an American?  Have babies for your living.  That's the American Dream, right there.  Not.  There's nothign there...  NOt even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                            <p>THey never granted me person-hood.  Did not think that I was worth of peron-hood.  My status as person was to be dependent only and forever on someone else who was to be kept on payroll.  I could just use sex, or something, to barter or trade for things I needed or wanted in life.  Nagging.  Maybe learn a little fighting.  Buy a gun.  American dream, right there.  Equality.  To consider myself lucky else grateful to be married off to an American.  Pteuy.  I spit on you.  Your stupid dream of living vicariously through your children.  You don't have kids for love.  You have kids because the American dream was not for you.  You were supposed to have kids so they could take them from you and...  Sexually molest them.  Probably.  If they felt like it.  What 'Universities'?  Of course I understand the worst of the worst travel to Australia...  Trying to find a bride...  But is that really true?  Why think that?  Ooooh.  I had my chance.  1 year in NOrth Carolina.  Maybe I supposed to get with the head leaseholder on the property I lived in.  Maybe that was the idea/l then.  For me.  What was the idea?  Was I supposed to apply to UNC while I was there...  Martin Davies told me not to apply to Australia and the US at the same time.  That it would not be good for me to agree to go to Aussie then pull out last minute if I got an offer from the US.  He said the Australian Department would miss out on funding and a student if I did that.  So out of courtesy I held off applying to Australia for 1 year.  ANd he wouldn't even write me a reference.  F*cking psychopaths.  I show them every courtesy and they are f*cking psychopaths.  Psychopaths.  Psychopaths.  </p>

The isolation (stay home mandate).  That was an act of violence, was it not?  What were the consequences to the studnet of breaking lock-down?  The idea was to use social media to shame and set teh wrath of the people against them.  How many kids left school because of the forced Covid tests?  They were shoving the nasal swabs up the nasal passage pretty hard, weren't they?  That get written up as an act of violence?  They like to pick and choose what counts and what doesn't -- don't they.  Informed consent for a nasal swab?  Hahahhahahaha.  They intentionally tareted the children of South Auckland.  THe vulnerable targets.  The ones they wanted on the front lines while the white people hid away in their houses.  F*cking psychopaths.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  Who taught the kids to be violent, eh?  Only ones you'd payroll. </p>

                            <p>Who taught them to shove the nasal swabs so hard up the nasal cavity?  Did someone just think that it would be fun to tickle the brain?  Psychopaths.  Psychopaths..  Psychopaths...  Not even trying to be humane at all.  Humane?  What is that?  Human.  Snort.  Not even trying to be fair at all.</p>

                            <p>Who profits the most if terrorists blow up a 'University' during graduation?  That's all these people who paid and paid and paid and paid and paid the University and nobody will have to payroll them at all.  That's what you call a win-win.  Thanks for playing.  Just make them have a baby before you schedule the graduation then you claim the baby as an orphan.  Redistribute it to the pedophiles.  Only one's you'd payroll.  What a great idea!  What a wonderful ideology!  Only game in town!!!  Only ones you'd payroll!!!!!</p>

                            <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/494734/insurance-payout-for-flood-hit-owner-raised-after-months-of-delay  You did not get what was fair, at alll.  They underpaid you by $10,000 and caused you more distress and harm and more expenses.  You had to do all this extra work that you shouldn't have been required to do (getting extra quotes) etc.  The courts did not punish them for punishing you, at all.  They enabled them.  Allowed it.  If they do to 100 other people what they did to you...  Then how much money to they save / make for themselves?  And how many awful employment positions are available, now, only because of their psychopathy.  Who wants to be a claims investigator when you only get the position because you are willing to rip people off.  I think what is supposed to happen at this point (the psychopaths will say) is that the people need to do a little people's court.  Take the Right Honorable Injustice out back and start pulling toenails until he feels inspired to rule what is fair.  Go after the claims people who 'no speak english' when processing claims in a similar manner or way until they feel sufficienty motivated and inspired to quote or find what is fair.  What is that?  You would rather the company be out of pocket.. . Let's see..  How much out of pocket do they need to be for them to be sufficienty motivated and incentivised to do the f*ckign job f*cking well properly?  (1)  Court costs.  They lost.  They pay all the court costs, therefore.  (2)  The lawyer costs.  They should pay their own lawyer and pay comparable legal fees for the opposing counsel.  (3) Damages.  Damages.  Damages.  Sufficient to motivate them not offending again.  Presently...  The courts are telling the people of NZ to rip people off because they courts will never make a judgment or ruling to prevent it.  No judiciary.  NOthing here.  Nobody home.   </p>

                            <p>The lengths they have to go to to try and motivate and incentivise women to go breed new Americans.  Yikes.</p>

                            <p>Do you think the soldiors playing their war games up north australia can hit Canberra, from there?  I double dare them.  I bet they can't...  Go on, I dare ya.  Australia reallyr eally really wants nuclear submarines, you can tell because they are advertising a physics post-doc for around 60,000 per year.  To work on their supervisors project.  SO motivating and inspiring!  And of course nobody can retrain in physics...  Nobody is allowed.  That's a special title reserved for the children of the administration.  Bart Simpsons inheritance or birthright or whatever it is to be on payroll to do the nuclaer thing.  FOr obvious reasons.  Bet you can't hit from there...  Bet you can't...</p>

                            <p>I know what would be a good job for Kelly...  Maybe she can sexually gratify ANdy Egan so that she can marry him and live in his basement and birth him children that can go to MIT as their birthright.  Because it's soooo merit based.  MIT.  Or maybe John Doris?  So he can move to Cornell and take the Psychology Professor's job that was his once his father died.  Give him a son.  So he can go on to be Psychology Professor at Cornelll.  His birthright.  AMerican Dream, right there.  Justice and equality for all.  Yeah, right.  WHy didn't my work ever go out for external examination?  I was good enough to be given a summer scholarship where Andy was the post-doc.  Good enough for John to fly me over there...  Thing about smoking is it is pretty good at indicating to people 'I don't want to live, like this'.  I wonder why I didn'dt want to live, like that.  I wonder why...  Gee...  I wonder...  I wonder...  I wonder why...</p>

                            <p>Ooooh Patrick.  You are sooo amazing.  LIke a yong Daniel Dennet.  What's wrong, Kelly?  Don't you want to go to Tufts?  Have a baby you can get in by their birth-right?  American dream, right there?</p>

                            <p>There never was any better reason to have a baby!  Give up your life and give us a baby!!!</p>

                            <p>I soooo miss Kirsty.  Perfect woman, right there, wink wink, nudge nudge.  I'm soooo sad I don't get to stay in Philosophy.  Then I could socialise with Kirsty and help host the Americans.  American dream, right there.  It's sooooo cmopetitive.  SOoooo cmopetitive.  Can't even get my work out to externals.  How was Andy's student doing?  Not his studnet, she was Princeton while he was employed by Rutgers.  But he brings her out to Canberra for some summer fun wink wink nudge nudge.  She was writing somethign something about how what women most want is every guys porn fantasy which was what made her such a feminist.  Obviously it was her thesis.  Not written by various old men.  Young men.  F*ckign psychopaths.  Psychopaths.  It's sooooo competitive.  Whatever happened to her?  Summer fling?  Did they ever get her work out to externals? Did she pop him a baby or 3?  They didn't give her a PhD but she can make babies for Andy.  American dream, right there.  </p>

                            <p>I guess I'm not supposed to say anything since my nephew is doing his PhD at Rutgers now.   After spending 2 years on a 1 year Masters from Auckland and then 4 years or something doing a 2 year masters in Texas.  Not allowed back into NZ because of Covid allegedly.  Married an American.  She's doing amin at Penn while he's doing his PhD at Rutgets now.  They finally got around to offering him PhD enrolment after 4++++ years of masters work.  They got my genes sort of.  Right?  Which is clearly what is important.  Bart Simpson and all that.  Nuclear power onwards ho!!!  </p>

                            <p>What American dream?  Stuck back in WWII.  Teh atrocities never stopped.</p>
                            
                            <p>I knooooow.  I'm too old to get a job.  Kim Sterelny at the ripe old age of 75+ won't get out, until..  Won't get out, until.  Payrolls won't stop until.  Death camp won't come until...</p>

                            <p>Apparently I'm 5 years post-graduation.  That means my qualification is no longer accepted (early onset dementia is ineviable. is the value of NZL qualifications) wereas their refusal to get out post 65 years is because of.... Nobody else could do it.  Everybody else's qualifcations expired because their qualifications go on into perpeptuity because garbage garbage nonsense no spik engleeesh they are too f*cking intellectually handicapped to see (while accusing everybody else thereof).  The dumb and dumber show..  Worse.  Worse... Where is Stuart McCutcheon?  Dawn Freshwater.  That sounds like a sensible name.  Like one your Mother would have given ya.  Not.  Not born in NZL.  Come here.  Nobody from NZL could possible work your job you f*cking retarded freak.  F*CK OFF.  Ooooh . I'm sorry.  That's not so polite.  Please F*ck off, mate, from the land from whence you come.  Go refuse to process aplciations on the basis of their acadaemic merits, back in England.  Only way you got into power -- right????</p>

                            <p>Don't get me wrong.  I respect my elders. Up until the point where I have accumulted evidence to show that THEY DO NOT RESPECT ME.

                            <p>Hiiiiii My name is Dawn Freshwater (chortle chortle snort of course it was) and I get paid more than half a million NZL dollars per year because I'm soooooooooo f*cking intellectually handicapped retarded that I can't read the room.  At all.  That's how f*cking stupid I am.  Half a million dollars for me.  Not born in NZL.  Not educated in NZL.  I'm such a f*cking stupid b*tch that I think I'm entitled to the NZL government spending more than half a million dolllars per year for me...  And.. The bounty on her head is worth.. In dollars...  And also in Art...  Why isn't she dead already?  I do not understand..  I'm sure people love her, somewhere.. Why isnt' she with them?</p>

                            <p>I'm sorry..  National person got a leak (that they weren't supposed to have got and maybe it's not even true) but they broadcast it.  Which is what you do with a leak?  Um... I think the issue has not been introduced in a credible or responsible manner..  Something is amiss.  If they want to 'feel things out' then announcing a leak is not the appropriate manner or way in which to do so... WHY AM I EXPLAINING? :GET SOMEONE ON YOUR PAYROLL TO EXPLAIN THE BASIC SHIT TO YOU</p>

                            <p> It isn't anything you havent' tried to enforce upon me.  ALl I am calling or asking for is what you give to me -- right  back to you.  Therefore. Die.  Die die.  Are you f*cking well dead, already.  Hurry up so that other people can live.  Die.  Are you dead yet?  Hurry up.  hurry up and die.  What is wrong with you?  Don't you understand your role or postion in life? Hurry up, Sterelny. Die!  Die!  Die!!!</p>

                            <p>Q for Sven...  I had a lot of fun in Temple of Elemental Evil.  One of the things I liked was that the dialogue options would tell you when you had them in virtue of a certain thing.  I mean, if you had dialogue options linked to having a certain number of skill points in a certain skill then they would tell you that.  Next to the dialogue option.  What that meant was that if you wanted to do a playthrough prioritising a particular thing, then you could see what dialogue options were there only because of it.  I don't really know what that would mean or how it would play out in or with cut-scenes.  But I mean to say that if one wants to have a 'dark urge' playthrough, for instance, will the 'dark urge' options be labelled as such?  Maybe it is obvious whether a dialogue option is only available because of dark urge..  But this might not be so obvious for some other dialogue options. For example.  Nature check?  Ranger?  Both?  I mean this so as to encourage?  Enable?  Allow?  Multiple playthroughs to experience the variety of different things that the game has to offer.  If you let people simply choose whatever they want they may fall back on their own personal stereotypes, or something.  Instead of them being able to commit to honoring their heritage..  Or something like that.  For out of character role playing...  That can be enjoyable.  And that encouage and support the development of a diversity of things.  Regardless of what the majority finds most natural.  Or easy.  Or similar.</p>

                            <p>http://ausconstitution.peo.gov.au/#covering-clauses  Hey, look, it's the Australian Constitution.  Check out: "6 Definitions".  See the part where it says 'The States shall mean such of the colonies of ...  New Zealand, as for the time being are part of the Commonwealth... </p>

                            <p>Whatever do you think it means?  </p>

                            <p>I think it means that we must remove literacy from the 'schools' post-haste.  Since it has already been provided that NZ is a State of the Federation of Australia on grounds of 'expediency'.  It was expedient to provide for the admission of NZ as a State of Australia on grounds of expediency.  </p>

                            <p>Where is my Australian Birth Certificate, then?  Where is my Australian Passport?  Where are my Australian Wages?  Not so expedient, now??</p>

                            <p>Ooooh.  It doesn't mean Australia HAS provided that, it means Australia might provide that.  Only if the people want it.  Where are the voting papers, then?  Where are the voting papers to  be supplied to the people born in NZ to see if they want to have Australian Birth Certificates and Passports and Wages and Medicines available via Medicare and HECS or HELP for Australian Universities?  Where are the voting papers to see whether the people want Aboriginal Voice to be entrenched?  Whether the people want Independence for New Zealand?  What democracy?  What rule by law?  What nuclear submarines?  Not in the next 15 years!!!  Nucleaer exclusion zone.  Not for you.  Can you imagine what would happen if the governments of NZ or Australia or both got their hands on nuclear weapons?  They really don't seem to care at all what the people think.  They don't even seem capable of reading their constitution.</p>

                            <p>----</p>

                            <p>Maybe Otago should explain to the NZ people why their Medical Degree, that is supposed to be 'competitive entry' on the basis of 'academic merits' is one where..  They say they didn't even calculate my GPA because 'other' or 'alternative' category accepts people who have never even studied at University level.  They are enrolling Australian Citizens into that programme.  Giving them NZ studnet loans.  Refusing ot allow NZ Citizens to get HELP or HECs loans to study in Australia.  Of course Australia is garbage, anyway.  Everybody knows you need to earn enough from you govt job to pay millions to Harvard so they can arrange for you to put on a ventillator when it's time to graduate you.  So that Dr Leeks and Dr Green..  The 10 day Orthopedic Hire for Canterbury..  Can be deployed into position.  For all the qualities it is that they value, one can only suppose.  Everything it is that they value.  Their values.  </p>

                            <p>Yaaaay see the only people in NZL allowed to train the next generation of medical students.  What medical studnets?  What next generation?  Waiting for the nukes to drop because nobdy here invested in anyting here. Nothing here.  We don't see anything here.  Can't see won't see anything here.  I'm less than nothing -- didn't yuo know>  best therefore worst murder me in my sleep.  F*cking psychopaths.  There's nothing here.  Nothing here. Nothing here.  Bomb it already.  Makes no f*cking difference to me.  Ther's nothing here.  There's nothing here.  There's nothing here.  Hurry up.  Die!  Die!!!  DIE!!! It isnt' anyting that they didn't wish for me.  Oooooh I'm so going to help you.  I'm not allowed to help you . I'm nothing . YOu go.  Go.  Go.  Die !!!! F*Cking die@!!! Die!!! De!!! how much you take for yourself every f*cking year?  How much for me?  YOu die!!! Di!!! Die!!! It's not rocket science.  Are you f*cking dead yet?  No comphrension of share.  Die!! Die!!! DIE!!!</p>

                            <p> <a href="writing/LAW 121B.pdf" target="_self">Law exam.</a>  </p>

                            <p>I wish I kept copies of the Population / Public Health essays that I wrote that were awarded 30 per cent only (I was failed for the entire course).  I personally don't think that they were appreciably worse than anything else I had done...  And I don't think that is coming from a position of bias.</p>

                            <p>Why did they fail me?  Because...  I didn't realise before-hand but the Population / Public Health pathway was a Maaori Pathway.  They had the people picked out who they wanted to do Medicine from that Pathway and they did not pick me.  Since I was passing Organic Chemistry etc they thought that the only way they could stop me taking what they believed they were entitled to was by failing me for the course -- so they could say that since I failed the course I was 'ineligible' to have applied.</p>

                            <p>At the end of the semester I dropped papers from the second semsester so I would end up with less than 120 points in that academic year.  That way I preserve my full time GPA.  That is how they define what full time and part time mean.  Your best 120 points per academic year.  If you haven't done 120 points then you don't have a full time GPA.  They think I am cheating that that is how they defined full time GPA and that was why I dropped back to part time.  But that was what they tried to do to me.  Ruin my GPA.  By failing me for Population / Public Health.  They forced me to flee the 'University'.  That is what University grades mean, according to them. They are discretionary things with no meaning.  Used to bully people around.  Arbitrary.  Not academic.  What University?  </p>

                            <p>How many other studnets are bullied into fleeing so that certain others are the only game in town?  The 'Universities' want to say people are leaving because of Covid.  But that doesn't seem plausible.  People (with capacity) are leaving because they are being bullied away.  Then the 'Universities' feel justified in simply not graduating the remainder.  They do the ethics tests and they enrol only those without ethics so they don't have to feel bad refusing to graduate them.  Why?  So the skilled labor jobs can be filled by Americans, I suppose.</p>

                            <p>In other words..  I suppose the only reason why I got first in class for the law exam was because I was enrolled in it as a general education paper (rather than as part of first year law) and they wanted to claim me.  They thought that I should pay and pay and pay and pay the 'University' so that they could...  Eventually...  Refuse to give me a law degree.  Else refuse to register me as a lawyer.  Else refuse to pay me as a lawyer.  You know how it goes.  You pay and you pay and you pay and you pay the 'University' until it is time for you to go away.  Because of all the 65 +++ year olds on payroll, still, and all the Americans who they see fit to give the NZ jobs to because there aren't any people here willing or able to be on payroll to do skilled jobs.</p>

                            <p>For example.  Brett Calcott married an American.  She was given employment by the University of Auckland so that she is paid to teach and research in Philosophy of Biology.  Why didn't they hire Brett (the NZ citizen) to work that job?  Or why didn't they hire Ben (the NZ citizen) to work that job?  Or why didn't they hire John Matthewson (the NZ citizen) to work that job?  Why did they choose to hire an American?  I thought we were only supposed to hire foreigners when there isn't anyone from NZ willing or able to work the job.  What was wrong with the NZers?  I'm pretty sure that any of them would have really really really wanted that job.  It would have given Brett financial independence...  Though, I don't know about Brett...  Is the idea that everybody sends their work to Kim Sterelny in his capacity as editor of the Philosophy of Biology journal..  Then he can delay publication until the people not already on payroll give up and go away or die or whatever.  Then he can reattribute authorship to people already on payroll. Or maybe reattribute authorship to the people he likes to party with, or something.  I mean to say, maybe Brett doesn't really have Phlosophy output.  Maybe he just does webpage stuff so that they can take take take the research outputs of some and reattribute them then to people who don't have the willingness or ability or whatever to have research output to record research output against their name.  I don't know.  It's soooo competitive, apparently.  Soooo competitive I should be run out of town!!</p>

                            <p>I suppose that now what happens is that Penn takes over the Philosophy of Biology Journal.  A former graduate of Penn gets employed by the University of Auckland.  The University of Auckland studnets work gets piped directly to Penn by way of Brett's wife ensuring that it all gets uploaded to Turnitin.  That's a great idea.  The USA can just take all the creative outputs and all the intellectual properly of the NZers.  Hand it to the particularly dim-witted Americans to pass off as their own.  Ingenious.</p>

                            <p>So, the 'University' of Auckland tells me that if I'm not going to apply on the basis of Health Science First Year (which I couldn't do since they said I failed the population health paper) I'd need to do an entire new qualification, instead.  I'm clearly not going to re-enrol in anything to do with Public Health.  Flee from Tamaki campus.  That's for sure.  Not a University, hey.  Not even trying to be.</p>

                            <p>So I apply to a 120 point 1 EFT MPhil with the University of Waikato.  I apply by the application deadline.  I get an auto response from the University acknowledging that they have received my application.  It is the day before the stated deadline by which applications must be received.  They then proceed to alter the time stamp and accuse me of being late.  They refuse to enrol me in the programme I applied to, by the application deadline.  Instead they offer me enrolment in a programme that I never applied to (with different enrolment dates).  What is the problem,  here?  How many other people applied to do a 120 point 1 EFT MPhil with the University of Waikatko in 2018?  I bet (I don't know, but I bet) the answer to that is:  0.  I bet...  That I was the ONLY person to have applied to that programme of study.  So, why won't they enrol me in the programme of study to which I had applied?  Are they afraid that I will fail?  They decided they were going to fail me before they even enrolled me.  What University?  There isn't anything there, at all. </p>

                            <p>Why do I think that nobody else applied to do a 120 point MPhil?  Becuase...  Now I'll tell you what the University Administration (the Vice Chancellor's etc) think about the 'University' education that is provided by their institution.  They think it is a bums on seats thing.  They think the students goal or aim or target is to be doctor by age of 25.  They think that their job (the job of the 'University') is to do everything they can to stop them.  Delay them.  Both of those.  Why?  Because until they are 25 they pay the University else they subsistence live.  But once they are doctors they will be rich.  Right?</p>

                            <p>So the studnets are all racing racing racing to grubby grub the little piece of paper qualification before they turn 25...  So to get there you have 18, 19, 20.  That is your 3 year under-grad degree.  21.  That's your honors year.  That's the equivalent of a 4 year college degree.  Now you are allowed to drink alcohol.  Congradulations.  22, 23, 24.  That's the 3 year PhD.  Will you actually get to graduate before you turn 25?</p>

                            <p>Masters degrees are for losers.  Haha.  Loooosers.  People who didn't have the honors grades to proceed directly to PhD.  Hahahahaha you aren't going to make doctor before you turn 25.  You loooose.  Looooooser.  I mean to say that nobody voluntarily chooses to enrol in a masters when they could enrol in a doctoral degree.  Masters degrees are what you enrol in when you don't get entry to doctoral programme.  </p>

                            <p>A little note here...  Your realising the above is supposed to have you go 'awwwwww.  I loose.  Awwww.  Better luck next generation.  Now I know what the game is, at least.  I can just marry my supervisor or someone else's and better luck next generation!  WHy don't I give up my life for someone else with the promise of part of me (the part that vicariously lives through my child) can have all of the things I want for myself.  I can force my child to do everything it is that I always wanted and the world will be a better place becuase of this ideology!)  Hahahahaha they fooled me into thinking that wasting my time with a masters was something to do and then hahahahaha I was too old for their tastes.  Best try and get the next generation in as very very special children.  The litle  boys off to Oxford at 7 for the men in the maths department, or music department, or similar.  Off to choir boys practice...</p>

                            <p>That is the thinking of the University administration.  So...  They refused to accept that I'd applied to do a masters degree.  Why?  Because I'd f*cking well done one already.  Also  because if they ranked me for doctoral or PhD I probably would have been their highest ranked applicant or candidate.  How do they rank their applicants or candidates?  On the basis of GPA?  My full time GPA for undergrad and honors year of my BA(hons) was 8.6.  I had a book chapter with OUP.  Published.  Already.  Before I applied to do a MPhil with Waikato.  How many of their doctoral applicants had publication, do you suppose?  They refused to accept that I applied to study a 1 EFT qualification only.</p>

                            <p>When I applied to Medicine with Auckland in 2019 they firstly tried to not offer me an interview.  I have to phone them up and yakkity yak yak yak yak about what the GPA cut off was and about how I exceeded that...  So interviews had already started before I get them to finally offer me an interview...  So I can book super expensive flights from Dunedin (where I was) to Auckland...  They didn't f*ck up my GPA by failing me for Population Health.  Turns out.  Took them a while to get there.  Not the brightest.  Hey. </p>

                            <p>Where is the research output of the people on payroll to do research?  Where is it?</p>

                            <p>The Australian National University kept Carl Brusse enrolled for more than 10 years.  Refusing to send the work that he had done out for external examination.  Getting more and more money from the government for keeping him enrolled.  Takign more and more work from him.</p>

                            <p>Nick Southwood said that the external examiners of his thesis did not request him to make a single change.  That seems suspicious to me.  Did he really get reports from external examiners?  I would have thought they would have thought that in order for them to be seen to be doing their job properly they would have suggested at least one change so they could feel that they added value by being external examiners.  I don't remember hearing anybody at the ANU defend their thesis to external examiners.  I don't think a single thesis defence was scheduled.  THey aren't allowing anybody to have their work externally examined by someone independent.  What education and training system?  There isn't anyting there.  It is sooooo competitive that there's simply nothing there, at all.</p>

                            <p>All these people over the age of 65 on payroll.  People who have had government payroll for more than 40  years.  They won't get out.  They want to say that nobody else could do what they do so we are forced to put up with their psychopathic selves.  However many generations need to die for their psychopathic selves. </p>

                            <p>They deserve the aged care systems etc that they invested in.  THey thought they were for other people.  But they should be the first to be signed up for the death camps that they made.  F*cking psychopaths.  There's nothing here.  Quite by design.  F*cking psychopaths, hey.  Not even trying to be fair.  Die so that other can have a life, for a change.  F*cking hurry up and die.  It isn't anything you didn't want for me.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                            <p>Can't even process an application to enrol.  *It's not supposed to be that hard*.</p>

                            <p>The Statutory Laws of NZ say that people are entitled to a free secondary education up until the age of 20 years.  But the Universities have chosen to market to teenagers to have ever increasing levels of debt recorded against their name.  They enrol them in programmes they never applied to and don't even grade their work properly, much of the time.  They feel justified in failing students who clearly have capacity because they are bullies.  It's soooo competitive and the teachers / graders want to eliminate the competition so they can be the only game in town.  It's sooooo compeititive!</p>

                            <p>Statutes are supposed to be for the protection of a group.  The Education and Training Act states that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible for enrolment in the programme they have applied to.  But the Universities like them young.  Preferentially enrolling teenagers.  Saying they are entitlted to enrol teenagers and throw away applications from domestic adults.  They say they managed to get soooo many applications from teenagers (after spending however many hundreds of thousands if not millions on advertising and propaganda) that they are entitled to preferentially enrol teenagers.  Or Australian Citizens.  They can just do anything anything anything they like. </p>

                            <p>And the courts say that Ms Roe did not complete an MPhil in 2018.  Becuase the Uni was entitled to refuse to get it to externals because 1 year is a 'truncated enrolment' that Ms Roe was not entitled to.  She was forced to spend how many years working on a doctoral qualification?  With no scholarship.  Indefinately detained in the name of 'disabiltiy'.  F*cking psychopaths.  There's really nothing in Australasia.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  Can't even parse their constitution.  But then I guess I wrote my thesis on disability and equity in Medicine and Public Health BEFORE the former studnets of Harvard and UNC, Chapel Hill took the Universities to court for race based admissions.  Correct?  And NZL and Australia must  be forced to follow however many decades or hundreds of years behind the US.  So they could send us all the ....  How is the obgyn for Invercargil working out?  I thought she was doing to be doing media con-munications.  How is she going with prescribing birth control for the victims of the government employed pedophiles to ensure no lasting evidence of their crimes (aside from the pathology STD or HPV transmission, of course).</p>

                            <p>It's just great that we get 'Dawkins selfish genes' yes.  Selfish, selfish, selfish.  You are sooooo selfish, that's right.  How old are you?  Still on payrolls?  Please, Dawkins, come to New Zealand and preach about your 'God Delusion' and how Maaori cultural beliefs are akin to God Delusions.  Maybe get Robert Nola to write a little something something (how old is he)?  Rosalind Hursthouse?  How old is she?  Who else is there in the Auckland department over 65?  How old is Kim Sterelny?  HOw about is wife?  Still on payroll.  I wonder where all the money goes...  Are we still payrolling their parents, too?  Wouldn't surprise me.  Their children, I'm sure.  Or maybe they like to keep their children and their children's children etc etc as slaves in their houses, still. Who knows the extent of their selfish.  Maybe get the Penn hire to write about the relationship between Maaori cultural beliefs and science.  Tell us how it is for the new generation.  Clearly nobody from New Zealand could work that job.  Certainly not..  Tahua.  Say.  How many years was he required to work on his doctoral thesis?  I know you claimed he was too depressed for you to acknowledge his work for a number of years.  ANd then he had cancer which meant you didn't acknowledge his work through that, either.  Which brings on more depression, I suppose.  Did you ever manage to find a payroll for him?  Or his wife, only.  Like how Brett is dependent on his US wife for the NZ payroll?  Is that the idea/l?  Is Ben Jeffares payrolled?  Or he has to live with Jo, really, whether he wants to or not.  FInd any more 'orphans' to claim at the airport?    </p>

                            <p>F*cking psychopaths.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                            <p>I understand why THEY don't want ME to be a doctor.  THEY think -- we would never help you.  We wouldn't even show you the most basic courtesy of professionalism.  So why would you help us?  Why wouldn't you treat us as badly as we have treated you?  In fact, why wouldn't you treat us worse - if you had opportunity.  Nothing that we wouldn't do to you if the positions are reversed.  Because they are psychopaths, you see.  </p>

                            <p>The thing they don't understand is that they aren't the only people in the f*cking world.  Other people are not as psychopathic as them.  And some other people could use a little help.  ANd I could help them.</p>

                            <p>But if I want to help people, the psychopaths think, then I am just begging them to help themselves to me.  </p>

                            <p>F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                            <p>I was always happy and pleased for them when things went well for them.  THe same could not be said for them with regards or respect to me.  They took delight in my being bullied out and away. It's soooooo competitive.  F*cking psychopaths.  Not room enough in the world for the both of us, they say.  So I'm forced to go away.  Did Rachel and Nick get reports from external examiners regarding their thesis?  How about Daniel Stoljar?  I am curious...  If there were reports they would have them.  So I suppose they know, themselves.  If they have reports from examiners then how come my work wasn't sent out for external examination.  Why didn't I get the same courtesy that they did?  You don't get to say that it didn't go out because it was garbage because by refusing to send it out you are effectively trying to fail me yourself.  But that wasn't for you to decide.  It was for external examiners who could assess it for it's academic merits irrespective of whether or not I'd slaved as long as Carl or brushed Sterelny's cats or math tutored his kid or...</p>

                            <p>Tim Dare and others used to say 'the present lot will have to die before there will be a job for you'.  Well.  If that is the game you choose to play -- hurry and up and die, then.  No.  I don't want to work in aged care.  That is on you.</p>

                            <p>Divide and conquer.  Everybody knows.  I didn't now or think that I was the best student.  I thought I was one of the studnets.  But let's all get together and throw rocks at Kelly - right, Sterelny.  It's soooooo competitive.  It's soooooo competitive!  It's such a f*cking hostile world and I'm a selfish prick.  Oh yes.  You are.  Hurry up and die you selfish prick.  How many years of payroll for you?  Time to get the f*ck out.</p>

                            <p>The US diplomat guy wants to say that US is all about upholding rule by law.  Really.  He can read the Australian Constitution, then?  He read the part about NZ being a State of Australia?  So why does the US greet Jacinda Ardern as Prime Minister of New Zealand rather than Premier of New Zealand?  Where is our supposedly democratically elected leader, anyway?  Presently on US terrain after having resigned all voluntarily-like after being offered a million dollars, or something, from Harvard.  Where is our democratically elected Mayor of Wellington?  Her dog has been issued a US swipe card for building access some government building in New York?  She's presently on US terrain, as well.  Where are the voting papers for people born in NZ, if you support rule by law and you've read the Australian Constitution.  WHy don't New Zealanders get to vote in the upcoming election to change the Australian COnstitution to provide a voice to aboriginal people?  Where are the voting papers for the people Australia regards to have New Zealand Citizenship?  Not even trying to be rule by law.  Not going to get nuclear submarines anytime in the next 15 years.  You know that the governments would only use things like that as a weapon against the people.  The governments don't want the people to have reading, writing, arithmetic.  Because they know full well they do not have the support of the people.  Because they are trying to f*cking well exterminate us all.  Makes the very very very very very best sense of pretty much everything it is that they choose to do.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                            <p>What do they think..  Maybe as much as 1/4 of the population of RI are people kept in detention camps in RI.  THat means there is likely to be more.  Undocumented people, or people who have had their documentation taken away.  Prisons.  Asylum camps.  Not federal psychiatric hospitals because there aren't supposed to be any federal psychiatric hospitals.  Quickly quickly reclassify them as neurology patients.  Fill up the aged care institutions.  Put the children in detention camps and keep them out of school.  Detention camps.  Prison camps.  *There's nothing there*.  Not the developed world at all.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>Paul Flood.  How many years of doctoral work did he give the 'University' of Otago?  Did they ever get his work out for external examination?  It't okay, he married a South African.  They gave her a job teaching philosophy at the University of Waikato because no New Zealander could have done it.  Tery Hardwicke.  They only gave him his PhD because he never applied for any jobs.  Right?  That was the only reason why they were okay about giving him his PhD.  How many hundreds of thousands of dollars per year for the Dean of the School of research to refuse to get studnets work out to externals?  Do they get the money from simply notn awarding any scholarships to students?  Apparently I wasn't of sufficient academic merit to get a scholarship.  Full time GPA of 8.6.  THey said that my research proposal was garbage.  It was so  garbage that they had to have a yakkity yak yak about why I wasn't ranked for a doctoral scholarship.  They were surprised I wasn't being put forward as their most highly ranked doctoral scholarship candidate.  Therefore they won't give me a masters scholarship at all.  WOn't get my masters work out for external examination.  Stupid f*cking idiots.  WHere is the Dean now?  Had to bring her in from England.  COuldn't find anybody stupid else psychopathic enough from NZL to work that job.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  Did she get to marry a NZer?  So that her marriage partner can be dependent on her, then?  Is that the basic idea?  Better move her on to Melbourne or WA to work with Harlene about how to re re re re stucture the 'University'.  There's really nothing there, hey.   Nobody  home.  Taken over by psychopaths.  Right, Sterelny?  F*cking psychopath.  Mate. </p>
