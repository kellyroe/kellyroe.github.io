 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">  

                            <p>
                            Who has applied to study a 120 point 1 EFT research masters qualification and had that signed off as completed within 34 weeks of enrolment?  Anybody?  Can you name me one person? 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Who has applied to study a 360 point 3 EFT doctoral qualification and had that signed off as completed within 3 academic years of enrolment?  Anybody?  Can you name me one person?
                            </p>

                            <p>Can you name for me a single person who has had their graduate level research *sent out for external examination by the University* in time for the externals to *possibly* sign off on completion of the qualifiation within the enrolment period?  I mean to say, if it takes 3 months to externally examine a 1 year research project with a 34 week enrolment period then the thesis will need to go out to externals at around the 22 week mark.  Can you name for me a single research student who has had their research sent out for external examination no later than the 22 week mark?  A single student?</p>

                            <p>What University?</p>

                            <p>The problem is not that there are certain topics that are off-limits.  The problem is that all topics are off-limits.  No research will be acknowledged as having been done.  The University gets more and more and more and more money from the government for keeping the hostages re re re re re re enrolled while the people on payroll do everything they can to prevent and prohibit the production of high quality timely research.  It is not possible.  They are not on payroll to do research.  They are on payroll to bully their studnets into being re re re re re re re enrolled for more and more and more money for the University.  The VC wants a payrise.  Therefore they must double and triple bill student enrolments for more and more and more money for the University.  The same brains behind Canterbury District Health Board refusing to even try and operate within the Government Approved Budget (their intentionally trying to blow the budget for special handouts every f*cking year) is now inspiring the University of Otago to similarly cook their books.  Claim to be too poor to pay the workers etc etc for increasing payroll for the VC etc.  What research output?  Take a look at the research output of the people on payroll to do research.  Do they do 5,000 words of research per year?  Less?  What University?   </p>

                            <p>It is the health management guy from Otago.  He has this idea of a social hierarchy (of course he views himself as well up that) and he somehow thinks it is an aspirational ideal for an organisation (e.g., a District Health Board) to present it's financial position as always running at a loss.  He thinks that that is an ideal way for them to report their financial position.  The DHB intentionally planned to blow the budget every year. They were determined to report that they were running at a loss every year.  Now the University of Otago is changing it's tune from being a public-ivy style or type of University with money behind it to one who will report running at a loss.  To justify the continued re-structures where they get people re re re re re re re applying for their old jobs for less and less and less and less pay.  Or similar.  Whatever they are doing there.  Take as much money out as quickly as you can and, I don't know, get detained for your crimes when you try and run away.  Where is Ashley Bloomfield, these days?  Is he 'between jobs' overseas somewhere?  Or did he actually get hired as Professor with the University of Auckland?  He didn't apply to enrolled in PhD.  He didn't write a doctoral thesis.  He doesn't have any research output.  I see why they hired him.  Do you?  What University?</p>
