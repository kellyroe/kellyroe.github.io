                            <p> https://www.nzherald.co.nz/kahu/the-investment-into-maori-apprentices-has-turned-around-maori-unemployment-youre-hired/4NEY2WL5RNAQ5KJ2OSEYM7IZGE/  Do the apprentices get paid minimun wage for every week of their apprenticeship?  Or do the 'apprentices' have levels of debt recorded against their name, with the Inland Revenue Department, while the Government pays the 'training provider' to keep them on less than minimum wage?  How are they being kept as apprentices?  For how many weeks of FTE enrolment are they to be kept before they get their qualifications which means you pay them more than you did when you were paying them to work as apprentices?  What education and training system?  What employment?  Not even trying to be fair.

                            <p>The Lawyer who liked to stick pins in children -- so they set him on vulnerable people to give him second and third and fourth chances to re re re re offend.  Did they register him despite his criminal history or because of his criminal history?  Dr Leeks was most valued employee redeployed to Melbourne to enable his continueed offending over there.  The lengths they went to to give him continued chances to reoffend.  The pay packets they gave him to reoffend.  They don't seem to be even trying to do anything properly.  What judiciary?  Not even trying to be fair.</p>
