                                There is a link to my CV that I have presently under consideration for various things.
                             </p>

                             <p>I will try not to do  anything to break the links.</p>

                             <p>I am file re-formatting my work.  Into tables and columns.  And also organising it into yearly increments.  E.g., </p>

                              <a href="./writing/ks.png">Here is an example of an email from Kim Sterelny (who will not write me a reference) so you can see how he chooses to speak to me.</a> 

                              I collated the 'few small chunks' as he refers to them, here:

                              <p>I'd suggest sending the military in *with* the international inspectors.  The international inspectors of how many people are being unlawfully detained in rooms off the side of the ED or various other places around the hospital. You know, for maximum billings for the hospital.  Keeping as many hostages as they can.  how many people held in seclusion rooms without paperwork having been filled out.  How many people have been given psychoactive substances by people on health system payroll -- without them having kept proper records of what they have given them.  How many unauthorised and non-consented procedures and so on have been performed.  Maybe open the supply cupboards and see what's going on there.  Why there aren't medical suppplies.  I guess they know where the supplies go becuase it wouldn't be that hard to microchip them.  That's how they figured out where the HIV medications were been diverted and where they were diverted to etc.  Right?  And so on.  Immunisations.  Where they ended up.  When.  And why.</p>
