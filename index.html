                            <p>
                                <a href="https://kellyroe.github.io/writing/realmecv.pdf">Chronological CV</a>
                                There is a link to my CV that I have presently under consideration for various things.
                             </p>

                             <p>I will try not to do  anything to break the links while I update contents.  I am in the process of file re-formatting and reorganising my work. </p>

                             <p><a href="./publish/2010-rep.pdf">Roe, (2010).  Lecture notes for Philosophy and Cognitive Science.</a></p>

                            <p>I am moving the contents of the course I developed (available from the teaching tab) into a single link (book) format.</p>

                            <p>I think about all the courses that I chose to enrol in (took out debt to enrol in) because I was genuinely interested to study the readings.  Go along to the lectures.  Engage with the material.  Dialogue with other learners.  The various people on payroll -- who can take University courses for free (even when they are the ones with salary).  And do they?  No. They aren't academically or intellectually curious enough to turn up to their peers or colleagues courses.  Often they don't / won't turn up to seminars etc either.  Not ones that aren't very specifically in their own department or given by their own friends.  I think about the variety of seminars that I have gone to over how many years, now, where I was the only one not paid to be there.  Where various people on payroll wouldn't go there.  I think about all the talks I went to where I listened politely and respectfully and tried to meaningfully engage.  And I ask:  When did these people (many of whom would have me believe were not only professional colleages but actually my friends)..  When did they show me the same courtesy?  Wonder why I'm not interested to build bridges to them?  I'm too busy putting up drawbridges.  Wonder why I am not working with them?  They were the ones who decided they had no interest in working with me.  Best choose them, then.  The only game in town.  There is no alternative.  They are the only ones who applied.  Well, them and Jacinda, clearly.  Who gets 3 fellowships from Harvard and an Honorary Degree for reading teleprompts.  Yeah, right.</p>
