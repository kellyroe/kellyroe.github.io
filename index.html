 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/politics/lawyers-looking-after-lawyers-panel-says-strip-law-society-of-powers-to-discipline/  The Law Society is not upholding professional standards.  Not any more than the Justices are upholding Justice.  I mean, what do you expect?  Una Jagose thinking the function of Crown Law is to close ranks about and protect the crimes of the Crown, and all.</p>

                                <p>There was a particular Professor who was going along to the law camps at Otago trying to teach the second year law students about appropriate conduct, or whatever.  When they started saying that it was inappropriate -- they redeployed him to Auckland.  He's a law Professor at the University of Auckland now, isn't he?  That was his promotion.  As Dr Leeks was promoted to Melbourne etc.  Who hired him for Auckland, again?  If you put in an OIA for information they should be able to tell you how much increase of public salary he is paid now because of his role in successfully managing the law camp to train the Otago students for however many years he was doing that for.   Most highly valued employee, and all.</p>

                                <p>New Zealand and Australia undermine themselves.  They won't get students work to external examiners so that it can be externally examined on it's academic merits.  They aren't processing applications to enrol, progressions through training, qualification completions properly.  They aren't advertising jobs, selecting from applicants on the basis of skills and experience, paying them properly.  They aren't doing anything properly.  They just redeploy people into position so they can ensure that the job for which they are paid is not actually performed by anybody at all.  There is nothing here.  </p>

                                <p>The leaders apparently choose (exerting their own soverignty) to run Australasia like a slave, prison, or detention camp.  They aren't at all even trying to be fair.  No conception of fairness, even.  Lacking the cognitive capacity.  It's all sooooooo competitive.</p>

                                <p>Head of MFAT is now saying they aren't even trying to be rule  by law.  I think that's why they aren't allowed to make milk powder unsupervised.  After poisoning the 'one child' with melamine, not allowed to make milk powder unsupervised, anymore.  Can't fly planes into NZ, even, because they won't follow international laws on flight path approaches etc.  Won't be able to drive, soon.  Will need to buy army tanks to get about the place since why would anybody follow the road rules?  Why would anybody follow any of the rules at all?  Who is going to make you?  Who and whose army?  Too costly trying to do business with NZ.  Nobody home.  The courts don't function.  They won't schedule a hearing, but if they do they won't hear the case that was actually brought before the courts, but if they do they won't find in the interests of justice.  They won't appoint judges by proper process.  They won't deliver judgments.  They make false assertions of fact and refuse to acknowledge half the statues.     Nobody there.  Nothing home.  </p>

                                <p>Una Jagose asserts that her job, as head of Crown Law is to serve the interests of Crown Law.  Yes.  That's what Justice means, Una.  I see why you were specially chosen for that job.  Did you even supply them a CV or did they tell you that was simply a formality because they picked you out for that one because you exemplified all the qualities they value?  They wanted to do everything they could to completely and utterly undermine public confidence in law, in NZ.  No conception of justice, at all. </p>

                                <p>The leaders of NZ have never been known or regarded as intellectuals.  They have always been regarded as anti-intellectuals.  The least well educated civil service and government in the world.  They preferentially hired graduates after 3 or 4 years of university study (only) to the civil service.  Preferring them to be younger and less knowledgeable and less experienced.  The idea was that they needed the Ministers to be able to understnd the reports.  They couldn't rely on the reading age or comprehension of the ministers being much more than them being able to read the abstract or table of contents.  So the reports say the same thing over and over and over and over and over.  So the Ministers don't need to read the reports.  The reports can only say what the Ministers said already so that the Ministers can claim to understand the reports.   </p>

                                <p>This preference for the youngest and stupidist being the most desirable.  The most 'trainable'.  To make the senior people feel competent.  Great way to run a country..  Into the ground.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>People come back from overseas with knowledge and skills and the leaders from here refuse to acknowledge them or allow them to function or contribute.  Because the f*cking stupid is too f*cking stupid.  And they know it.  They never would have been appointed into position if they had have been anything else.  Intentionally deployed to ensure the prevention and prohibition of development in the slave colony prison camp detention facility lands.  Not even trying to develop.  Everything they can to prevent and prohibit it and follow as slowly behind dragging the heels every step of the way.  Retard-land.  People kept retarded.  There is nothing here.</p>

                                <p>There aren't any universities because they aren't processing the applications to enrol properly.  They aren't progressing people through their qualifications.  They aren't graduating all and only the people who did the work they were supposed to for the qualification.  They aren't paying the workers.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>What is a GP supposed to do, exactly?  Let's have a think about that, so we can understand why it is desirable to pick out teengers when they are 18 for that one.  Firstly, they say 'we will get an assistant to the nurses assistant to take a sample and send it to the labs' because you can't diagnose very many things without pathology reports.  Secondly, they say 'it is probably a virus therefore there is nothing we can do so no antibiotics for you go way' (that was a big one, prior to 2018).  Thirdly, they say 'hmm.  We better watch and wait and see what happens.  Come back to me again if things get worse'.  That way they get more money for repeat visits, at least.  Fourthly, they say 'go to the ED'.  Fifthly, they say 'that's outside my scope of practice so I'll put you on the waitlist to see a specialist'.  What else does a GP do, in NZ?  The assistant to the nurses assistant (likely the unpaid student doing their internship) does the blood pressure and so on.  So what are GPs for, exactly?  What is it that they do?  Aside from telling people that healthcare is not for them by delay delay delay delay until they die, of course.  Which is basically the same function as the judiciary.  And basically everything else in NZ.</p>

                                <p>Is someone really doing their PhD thesis on attachment and how people attach to cats, or similar?  Who is supervising that one?  I'm curious because I was interested in psychoanalytic / dynamic / attachment stuff for a while there and I didn't see any university academics in NZ doing any research along the lines of any of that.  It surprises me that there would be.  We are basically doing 'Brave New World' types of interventions trying to breed or raise a slave class of Gamma babies by design.  Raising them in Fisher and Paykal incubators.  After having induced premature delivery in the name of 'for their own good' so as to interrupt attachment.  Sort of raise them as Harry Harlow primate research laboratory babies.  Run this social engineering experiment out of New Zealand.  Of course.  So the graduates from Harvard can come visit and see how the Harry Harlow primates are doing and see Rheumatic Fever in the wild etc.  Are our leaders really too stupid to see any of this for what it is?  Too stupid by design?  Una Jagose tells you everything you need to know about NZs attitude to this kind of thing.  Easier to conceal it (easier to work to undermine the public interest) if people from NZ aren't allowed to study attachment and so on.  So the judges can order the babies to be kept on incubators and the mothers to be imprisoned for the babies own good (and not because of the perversions of the likes of Dr Leeks).  Yeah, right.  </p>

                                <p>Let's do a little brain-storm, shall we, on what more the leaders of Australasia could possibly be doing in their quest to do everything they can to undermine public confidence?  Can you think of anything more they could possibly be doing that they aren't doing already?</p>

                                <p>How much money was Kim Sterelny paid by the Australian National University to supervise my research during my PhD candidature?  Why didn't he get me any comments on my writing?  Why didn't he meet with me?  Apparently I have no proof or evidence that he didn't.  I can't supply evidence that he didn't -- but what is relevant is that he can't supply evidence that he did.  Check his email inbox for work that I sent him.  Check his email outbox for supervision or meetings he set up with me.  You will see that I did my work and he did not do the job for which he was paid.  The University administration has documented that I supplied them with a table of contents asserting I had written more than 100,000 words on a thesis document.  They never sent me a reminder or information as to what I needed to do to get that to external examiners.  They never sent it out for external examination.  They never did the job for which they were paid.</p>

                                <p>How much money did the University of Waikato get for having me enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled in a 120 point MPhil thesis.  I applied to be enrolled in a 120 point MPhil thesis.  I did not apply to be enrolled in a 240 or 360 point MPhil thesis.  They refused to get my work to external examiners with instructions for them to examine it for the qualification that I applied to be enrolled in.  THey refused to do the job for which they were paid.  </p>

                                <p>All these people on payroll who refuse to do the job for which they are paid.  Maybe they are incompetent.  Inept.  Can't do it.  So the government keeps me on disability 'supported living payment' (sounds kind of like 'life support' haha) while paying these people hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to keep slaves.  All the work I did and they refused to pay me for any of it.  It costs them nothing to acknowledge that I'd done enough for completion of the qualification.  It costs them nothing.  It is not about the money.    </p>

                                <p>What was Justine Kingsbury's research output for 2018?  She was paid, as a university academic, to have the primary function of producing a research output.  Where is it?  She thinks I did not produce enoguh in the 2018 acadmeic year for credit for a 120 point qualification.  I am asking to see the work she did for her tenured position as a philosophy academic.  Where is her research output?  WHere is her evidence of supervising me in 2018?  Where is her evidence of having helped me complete the qualification in a timely fashion?</p>

                                <p>They aren't universities.  They are keeping slaves.  They aren't paying the workers.  People contract to do work in exhange for it going to be externally examined for the qualification and they aren't having the work externally examined.  I know that they are saying that other studnets graduated from the qualification (ANU is anyway, not sure that Waikato is graduating research students at all).  But I don't know whether their theses ever go out to externls or whether it is that some peoples parents pay exhorbitant bribes or similar.  Auckland University wants to assert to the courts that they have authority to refuse to acknowledge a NZ University qualification that was completed more than 5 years ago.  So that tells you what the Univesrity of Auckland thinks of the value of NZ University qualifications.  Of course people with NZ University qualifications that expired more than 5 years ago include the Judges and so on.  But then apparently Auckland UNi just hired Ashley Bloomfield as Professor and he doesn't have a PhD or an MD (he does not have a research doctoral qualifiation), he never applied to be enrolled in one, never wrote one.  He does not have a research output.  The anti-intellectual politicians want to declare themselves head of the university now.  They think that makes them intellectuals?  Jacinda Ardern is an intellectual now with her honorary degree?  She's having things published about her contribution to the fashion world, or something...  </p>

                                <p>Ben Jeffares thinks that my work in 2018 was garbage.  But he doesn't get to decide.  He's not an external examiner.  Why would he think that the Univesrity doesn't have to give me the basic courtesy of having my work externally examined on the basis of it'as academic merits for the qualififation I applied to be enrolled in and the qualification I had been working on?  If it really was garbage then get it to teh externals.  If the externals say it is garbage you can be all 'hahaha I told you so you are garbage!  See, I was right!'.  But instead you say that it's so garbage you aren't even goign to send it out!  That's how garbage it is!  It is soooo garbage that you get paid to do a post-doctoral research fellowship for 1 academic year while I have to pay the univesrity for my year of academic research.  Where is your research output for the post-doctoral fellowship?  WHere is it?  Why not get your one year research and my one year research out to externals and have them externally examined on the basis of the academic merits.  See which one of them should have  been funded for the post-doc.  Oh, but I can't apply for post-doctoral fellowships because my supervisors are too busy telling me how garbage I am and refusing to send my work out.</p>

                                <p>There isn't an actual university.  It got overtaken by psychopaths.  By design. I think it was a ploy to drive up private school prices in the US.  By undermining Australasian Public Universities the likes of Ashley Bloomfield takes up all the Professorships for himself while sending his kids off to Harvard, I suppose.  So they can do their low to no value 2 year masters certificate in legal studies or whatever.  Not sure what kind of a bribe or exit payment there is if they want to graduate with their cohort.  We don't believe in cohorts, in NZ.  Just expediate through the stupid children of the Administration so they can get busy covering up for the crimes of their parents. Who were your parents Una Jagose?  Where they somewhere high up a little closer to the time when Dr Leeks was beign head-hunted into his position for the NZ government?  But you are around now, with the likes of Profesor Glue.</p>
