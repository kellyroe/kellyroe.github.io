                            <p>Waiting for the social security appeals authority to overturn the ministry of social development's declaration that 'justice not essential need'.  It hasn't been overturned when the substantive hearing of the issue was more than 9 months ago.</p>

                            <p>This is so that cases can be heard on appeal.  The High Court Judges were (in 2 instances) re-appointed into position from retirement.  NZ has a compulsory age of retirement for Judges and the Judges are required to get out once they hit that age.  These 'Judges' were required to have gotten out.  They were not appointed  by proper process at all, because there is no proper process for re-appointing Judges past the age of their retirement.  Why am I having to explain this?  NZ is not even trying to be rule by law, at all.  What judiciary?</p>

                            <p>The 'Universities' of NZ are not properly processing applications to enrol, graduations etc.  They refuse to comply with the education and training act. They refuse to comply with Tertiary Edcuation Commission Guidelines.  Chris Whelan is paid upwards of several hundred thousands of dollars every year to take all the complaints that he receives every year and declare each and every one of them (since he was appointed to office in about 2014) to not be a complaint of serious wrongdoing, at all.  He refuses to follow the policy that the NZVCC wrote that it would follow when it receives complaints.  He refuses to get evidence to police.  He refuses to bring issues (or allow complainants to bring issues) before the NZVCC.  Not even trying to comply with the statutory laws or government policy documents of NZ.  Judges hauled out of retirement for the occassion cannot / will not see anything wrong.  There are none so blind as those who will not see.</p>

                            <p>The Supreme Court of NZ declares that it is not a matter of public interest that NZ Universities are not properly processing applications to enrol in MBChB (Medicine) or graduate research qualifictions.  That they are keeping false records about enrolments including sending false information to the Inland Revenue Department.  Saying studnets have been enrolled in programmes they never applied to.  Refusing to get work that has been submitted for external examination out for external examination.  What Universities?  What judiciary?  WHat health system?  They aren't processing applications for Medical School.  They aren't processing graduations.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  There's nothing there.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>
