                            <p>
                            The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications.  They define a 120 point program of study (e.g., the 120 point MPhil program of study that I applied to be enrolled in) as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a>.  Despite this, New Zealand Universities do not allow graduate research students (particularly) to complete their graduate research in a timely fashion.  In order to prevent and prohibit timely completion they refuse to get work to external examiners and they also believe they have authority to fail studnets at their own discretion if students attempt to submit their work in time for timely completion. 
                            </p>


                            <p>  
                            The University of Otago believes they have discretion to throw away applications without considering them on their merits.  Reasons they have for throwing them away include whatever arbitrary reasons they want including information they have about disability or race:
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  The Justice for the High Court Proceedings was one who seems to have been pulled out of retirement in order to hear this case.  The government chooses to get judges out of retirement rather than appointing new judges. 
                            </p>


                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings on grounds that it had already passed judgment on the filings and would not revisit the issue.  They did not think my filings sufficient to show there had been a grotesque injustice in how they handled my filings.  I post them here so that you can judge for yourself.  
                                </p> 

                            <p>
                            The Australian Constition lists New Zealand as a State of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  
                            New Zealand is listed as one of the original states of the federation of Australia.  It states that New Zealand has not been asked to be part of the Commonwealth, and it has not consented, but it is expedient to regard it to be a part of the Commonwealth.  There has not been a referendum to alter the constitution to have New Zealand removed from it's status as part of the Constitution of Australia.  As such, I don't see how it is lawful for Australia to require New Zealanders to have Australian Visas - even less to remove visas and deport people to the State of New Zealand.  I don't see how it is lawful for Australia to withhold Australian Passports, Birth Certificates, and how it is lawful to have a separate currency (that mostly seems to function only to disguise how low wages are kept in New Zealand and to prevent New Zealanders travelling inter-state).  I don't see how it is lawful for them to Withhold voting papers for the Australian Federal Elections.  Refusing to allow people who were born in New Zealand to run for office in Australia or to work in Australian Government Positions (post 2002 or similar).  We should get medications that Australia has as part of a bulk purchase agreement with Australia.  Down with Pharmac!!!  Preventing and prohibiting New Zealanders from having first world medications!  Bah!!
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The Universities of Otago and Auckland are not being fair as to how they are choosing what students to enrol in Medicine.  It wasn't that Dr Leeks (Dr Green etc) happened to slip through a selection criterion or process objectively and fairly applied.  It was that he or they was or were hand-picked or specially chosen for demonstrating all the qualities it is that they value.  I suppose, then, Dr Leeks was transferred to Melborne because that is also what they value over there.  I don't see what else we are supposed to think about that when they harbor him they way they have chosen to.  They are not even trying to be fair.  They appear to be trying to select people who will use their position to bully and abuse and commit violent criminal acts.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The Universities and courts have broken the social contract.  The Courts have chosen to set precedent that it will cost upwards of $20,000 to take a case against the University to the High Court, and even then they work to delay and obstruct and prohibit and prevent justice.  The judiciary does not appear to function.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I started a PhD with the Australian National University.  They chose to offer me Australian Government Funding (APA) in order to do a PhD with the ANU.  They chose to do this after seeing how I worked at the ANU as a Summer Research Scholar.  They chose to give me a VC Award so I could travel to UNC, Chapel Hill for an academic year and do coursework and teaching in the USA.  But my Supervisor (Kim Sterelny) wrote a Slavery Manifesto during my time there ('The Evolved Apprentice') with a lovely cover of giving a monkey a peanut.  I was bullied into leaving the University without receiving a PhD.  Apparently there wasn't any point giving me a PhD because there never would be a job for me.  Apparently I would need to wait until the older generation died before there would be a job for me!  I post my PhD work on this site (on the writing and seminar page).  I applied to START a PhD with the ANU for 2022 and my application was declined.  Apparently I haven't even done enough work to START a Phd with the ANU!  I can't wait to see the CV of the new intake of students to their PhD programme!  The publications they must have, already!  Or maybe the ANU acts in bad faith in the way in which it treats at least some of their students.
                            </p>

                            <p> They are getting my student records together to get back to me.  Apparently they have them already, I don't know why they need so much more time before releasing them.  I guess that's their job.  The money goes around the way the money goes around and since the money is going around the way the money goes around their primary job is to waste everybody else's time.
                            </p>


                            <p>
                            Otago has recently claimed that a reason why graduation was cancelled and we didn't see any research students publically credited with having completed their research qualification was because they received threats of violence from a former student.  It does occur to me 'there is no excuse for threats of violence'.  But it also occurs to me that there is no excuse for how Otago has chosen to treat it's students.  I feel so sad for that girl who was failed by Otago 2 years in a row.   What options are there for students or employees or slaves or volunteers when people who have kept them working or studying do not honor terms and when the courts refuse to uphold the law?      
                               </p>

                               <p>
                                The Education and Training Act 2020 and the Education Acts prior to that all stated that domestic adults who had attained the age of 20 years were eligible to  be enrolled in the programme they applied to.  They stated that teenagers (under the age of 20 years) were able to be enrolled by the University only if the University was satisfied that they were able to complete the course.  So, when we hear of a Univerity being satisfied enough that a teenager could complete the course so as to enrol them and take their money and we then hear of the University failing them for their course not only once, but two years in a row, then it really looks like the University has some explaining to do as to how it was that they could not pass the student.  The High Court of Dunedin did not see it that way because the Judges don't seem willing or able to understand justice. 
                                </p>

                                The New Zealand Government has chosen to create and impose incentive structures incentivising slavery.  Preventing and prohibiting the development of training systems and skilled labor.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgement_of_Solomon  This is what justice looks like.  I don't know that many people, within New Zealand, would even know what justice would look like.  The ruling of a wise judge.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                https://journal.nzma.org.nz/journal-articles/an-ethical-dilemma-informed-consent-balancing-patient-dignity-and-medical-student-participation-in-sensitive-examinations  I guess the situation is more likely to be like this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNedXZ3vHZQ  Nobody had to tell the Nazi doctors to sing while they marched people off to the death-camps.  They did their work with joy in their hearts.  You just can't teach these things.  The New Zealand Medical Students (some of them) hesitate.  That's how you can tell who won't be graduating with their Medical class.  Or, even if they do, they won't be selected for further training.  Or, even if they are, they won't be signed off from having completed it.  But even if they are, they won't be shoulder tapped for employment.  But even if they are, they won't pay them.  
                                </p>

                                  <p>
                                There is no 'ethical dilemma'  between 'educational opportunities' on the one hand, and upholding informed consent (treating the patient with dignity), on the other.  This is because you are not teaching students how to perform intimate examinations or surgeries when you are requiring the students perform sexual and physical assaults.  If you don't know the difference between an intimate exam and a physical or sexual assault then you need to stand down.  I didn't properly appreciate that abortion was criminal until 2020.  In practice, they just got someone signing off that the woman would suffer mental distress if she didn't get the abortion she wanted and in that way they were all approved on mental health grounds.   But they were delayed, first, of course, so the teenage boys could get to experience being renegade women's rights warriors or liberators not wanting the word to get out how many abortions they'd done in case their lives were endangered by the anti-abortionists.

                                <p>Here are  <a href="judicial-review/sup-court-waikato.pdf" target="_self"> My Filings </a>to the Supreme Court regarding the Public New Zealand Universities discretion to decide on 'personal grounds' who they choose to enroll (or not) progress (or not) or pass (or fail).  You can see the filing date on my submissions.  The courts are not progressing the filings and so I post them here so that other people can see that they are not progressing my filings.    
                                </p>

                                <p>The Social Security Appeal Authority has not scheduled a hearing of the substantive issue that I brought before the court in writing.  Instead they have notified me of their intention to schedule a telephone call some unspecified time after 4 July 2022 where they can have a yakkity yak to me about what issue they will agree to schedule a hearing of (if they will agree to schedule a hearing at all):  <a href="judicial-review/ssaa.pdf" target="_self"> Information about their intention to schedule a phone call to have a yakkity yak about a possible hearing sometime after July 4 </a>.  Are they trying to say sometime after someone tries to blow up Parliament...  They may get around to thinking about scheduling a hearing?  There doesn't appear to be any time-line at all of when anybody will do anything at all.  New Zealand does not appear to have a functioning judiciary at all.  The courts are not scheduling hearings of cases, are not hearing cases, are not delivering judgments of cases, are not delivering justice.  There doesn't appear to be anything here, at all.
                                </p>

                                <p>  The issue is that the Court of Appeal has set Security for Costs at more than $20,000 when they knew my primary source of income was SLP and when I provided to them information that I did not have appreciable savings or assets.  The court of appeal says they are justified requiring me to pay more than $20,000 security for costs because my cases are not matters of public interest.  My cases are about the conduct of New Zealand Universities refusing to comply with the Education Act and refusing to comply with international community prohibitions on slavery and bonded servitude.  The New Zealand Government is the major employer.  Private Businesses only subsist on Government Hand-outs (the Procurement process is corrupt).  The Government mostly seems interested to get people to invest in business -- in order to bankrupt them.  The New Zealand Government will not pay the workers.  Will not pay the workers.  Will not pay the workers.  Will not allow people to work meaningful jobs.  Will not allow people to train.  Will not acnowledge or recognise the trianing people have done.  Will not do any of the f*cking things that they are supposed to do.  The most under-productive economy in the f*cking world.  The people can't kill themselves fast enough.  The New Zealand Government cannot kill the people any faster...

                                I want...  I want the University of Auckland to process my application to Medicine for 2019 and 2020 on it's merits.  I did everything required for me to have completed a 120 point program of study with the University of Waikato in 2018.  The University of Waikato chose to violate the Education and Training Act by refusing to get my work to external examiners on multiple occasions so as to prevent and prohibit external examiners from signing off on timely completion.  Their corruption should not cost me a place in MBChB.  Auckland doesn't get to set eligibility criterion for domestic adults.  They are required to train me if and only if my rank order score is high enough for offer of place.  I'm not asking for disability equity consideration.  I'm asking them to put my actual full time GPA from a NZ University into their f*cking algorithm and offer me a place (or not) on the basis of my rank order score.  It is now 2022...  Where is my place that ya stole???  C'mon New Zealand.  Hurry up...
                                 </p>

                                 <p>It is difficult, in New Zealand.  People can't make a way of living, they can't make a way of life, in New Zealand.  It isn't about them aiming to be rich, even, it is just about them wanting to accumulate wealth or appreciate in value rather than being regarded, by New Zealand, as a liability.  People feel forced to flee because there isn't a way for them to accumulate or appreciate in value, in New Zealand, so far as they can see.  They are often accepted into training programmes etc overseas...  So they can learn things...  That they can bring back to New Zealand.  Valuable skills that they could not have learned in New Zealand.  But when you return to New Zealand you are shunned.  The attitude is one of 'you left us before -- you will only leave us again'.  But people only left because they were told 'there will never be a job for you, not in New Zealand'.  So, what are people supposed to do?  Leave?  
                                </p>

                                <p>Ooooooh Amy Liu!!! Amy Liu!!!! ALLLLLLLLLLL of the jobs -- for you!  Is there nothing that YOU cannot DO!!! Amy Liu!!!  Amy Liu!!!  All of the people who spend so much time devoting their lives to exercise science...  But oh no!!! Here comes Amy Liu!!! Is there nothing thing Amy Liu Cannot Do???  ALLLLL of the jobs for you, Amy Liu!! ALLLL of of the jobs for you!!!  Is this supposed to be 'motivating and inspiring?'  To who?  To whom?  I'm sorry Amy Liu...  I suppose you wanted to be a Medical Doctor.  I'm sorry there isn't any Medical Doctor work for you.  You get to be fitness model instructor, instead.  Right?  Is there nothign Amy Liu cannot do?  Sigh.  Why, New Zealand?  Just...  Why?  I think we call this...  Tone deaf.  You expect the people to go to work, all day. to not earn fair wages...  To then show up the gym, trying to do everything they can to be good people.  Fit, healthy people.  To look after themselves.  And there goes Amy Liu!!! So motivating and inspiring!!!  Sigh.  Yay you!!! AMy Liu!!!! There doesn't appear to be anything anything anything at all that you cannot do!! You win the great hierarchy of life!!!!  Yay you...  Amy Liu!!!
                                </p>

                                <p>Sigh.  That sounded horribly bitchy.  Sigh.  What I mean to say is...  When you get college level athletes in your class...  They will fidget their way though class.  because their elite level bodies are telling them that it is not good for them to sit still.  They could sit still -- but only at a cost to their athletic performance.  They will sleep their way through class.  Because they were up at 4am to get to training in the morning.  Then they ate a great breakfast (hopefully) and now it's nap time, during your class.  Is that isn't the way that it is -- then they aren't training their ahletic performance properly.  Because that's the way that it is.  You just don't get elite level olympic athletes who function like elite level academics.  Becuase specilisation of labor...  If you get 'general people' excelling at ALL the things...  No specialisation is going on...  
                                </p>

                                The group fitness instrutors at Les Mills (many of them) are really really great at their jobs.  They go over and above and beyond.  With respect to the amount of honest work that they put into their training and their study so as to teach the classes and be responsive to what people are doing in their classes.  And Amy Liu sh*ts all over their efforts and their accomplishments (also the efforts and accomplishments of various MD people out there in New Zealand) by thinking she can present a face to the world whereby she does ALL the things seamlessly.  Is there not ANYTHING that AMY LIU CAN'T DO???  Well...  ANything that AMy Liu can do...  Is that worth doing?  That's sort of kind of the issue or the problem, here...
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I mean, I just don't get it.  As a Medical Doctor you would think you would have various academic things to be training for.  Also varoius practical skills.  St John's runs courses, and the like.  I don't get how you have all this spare time to invest in training how to do another job entirely.  how to work two jobs.  Not only a Medical Doctor (enough to justify the fact that you took up a training place) but also the job of a gym fitness model / instructor.  Taking the job of a gym fitness model / instructor...  Because you get paid so much in your day job that you will work your night job -- for free?  Is that how it goes?  ALLLLL of the jobs for you?  ALLLLL of the things for you?

                                I find it really sad because there are so many people at Les Mills who really work themselves too hard, really, to have a way of life in something that they love.  And then other people come along and just sh*it all over that.  New Zealand does not have the developed systems.  Physio and Ortho and so on.  Rehabilitative Medicine.  It particularly does not have division of labor or specialisation of labor.  Because it picks out one or two seemingly by random to be lord and master elite leaders of alll the things.  Will not allow division of labor.  Won't do it.

                                <p>Sigh.  I try really hard not to say anything disparaging and so on...  I don't know what the model looks like...  The training model.  What people have to do to get to be a fitness instructor at Les Mills.  Pay them however much for their 'training' and get however many miow miow beans votes every single class to get scheduled on.  They will not invest in people.  This is New Zealand.  Why would they invest in people?  Why?  That sounds...  Almost....  HUmane.  WTF???

                                Well, of course, it's super f*cking hilarious.  I mean, how many years can it possibly take (how many hundreds of thousands of words) to get a 3 year PhD from Australasia?  I mean..  HOw intellectually retarded must some people be.  Right?  Really handicapped in the brain.

                                <p>Well...  NZ had to go to America.  To beg for computer software, at least.  Parliament.  The Courts.  The Universities.  Could not function without Microsoft Word (for example).  How would htey do bookkeeping without Excel?

                                It seems that the US agreed to keep supplying us with IT.  So the people of parliament could keep using Microsoft Rooms and Gmail.

                                Great that the media from NZ realised that their primary function was to take selfies and try and make NZL look good to a NZL audience (by taking selfies?).  They did not at all think that really they should be rather humble since they were begging, rather.  That the point was for the US media to make NZ look good to US audience.  No?  We only want the degenerates seeking to do business with us.  Clearly.

                                Nobody needs to lay down the law in NZ.  Somebody needs to see about upholding the law.  We don't seem to have the willingness and / or ability.
