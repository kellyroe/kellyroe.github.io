                                <p>If a cat scratches your face while you are sleeping then it might be a good idea not to let the cat into the room when you are sleeping.  Attachment is two-way.  The cat was named flea-bus by people because that indicated something of how they felt about...  Sometimes the fit just doesn't.  Through no fault of either party.  It just doesn't work out.  There might be some grumpy old man, or similar, that is a better match or fit.  I don't know.  The government has told you the meaning of life, what is a meaningful life.  No?  It is to obey the government because they know what is best for you.  They pay some people, allegedly or apparently, to impose the will of the government.  Sanction or punish or whatever people who aren't sufficiently obedient.  Apparently or allegedly special snowflakes are actually on payroll for all the qualities it is that they value.  Actually, the government has decided that it really really really really likes children.  Who will do all of the work for none of the pay.  When it is time to pay them then it is time for them to go away.  Be declared retarded.  Imprisoned.  Wrongful deathed.  You get the idea.  New generation of child slave workers coming through to do all of the work for none of the pay.  And a few leaders picked out for being specially f*cking stupid, of course.  No frontal lobes.  No conception of justice or fairness or anything at all.  Can't see past their own f*cking selfish.</p>

                                <p>https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/politics/almost-200-nurses-midwives-and-specialist-doctors-approved-for-residence-pathway-but-many-were-already-here/  We are 'competing' with Australia for a work-force, are we?  We don't want to pay our workers, and neither does Australia, so that makes a lot of sense.  The prospective or potential work-force can pay us can pay us can pay us can pay us can pay us can pay.  They can pay us for visa processing and reprocessing and rereprocessing and rererereprocessing.  They can pay us for registration fees.  Reapplications for reapplications for reregistration fees.  They can pay us they can pay us they can pay.  They are starting to think it's a scam?  Well let them go pay Australia, then, since it's soooooooo competitive.  They can start with the visa application process (and pay us and pay us and pay) all over again!  Soooooo competitive!  Taking off to Ausralia for 'better pay'?  Really?  How much does it cost to have your visa reprocessed for the reprocessing of the reprocess in Australia, then?  It's soooooooooo competitive!  Why not just quit voluntary-like and go retrain for something else?  Do an internship several decades long.  It's sooooooooo competitive!  You pay us to do your internship!  Then since it's soooooo competitive you go pay Australia to do your internship all over again!  Ooooh check out the nature of the competition!  Ashley snoockums needs a pay-rise.  He can't manage his monthly salary on weekly payments unless he gets enough to pay his monthly bills out of a weekly payment amount.  It's soooooooo  competitive occasionally he even needs to supply his CV, just as a formality, you know.  Check out the nature of the competition.  See, he's 'politically neutral' because he's paid by the part of the government that doesn't actually change between elections.  That's the thing about being the likes of Una Jagose.  Governments were supposed to change or be handed over after election events.  But we don't actually have election events, because there is little to no change in which people are in parliament and which people aren't after election events.  Their role might change (whether they think their job, now, means they need to oppose everything and be as oppositional to everything as possible) but they are still there.  It's sooooooo competitive they don't even need to count the votes to know which  leaders international community will say are soverign lords bearing soverign responsibility for how f*cking stupidly competitive idiot-land is insisting on being today and every other one.  I'm sure Ashley snookums doesn't even manage his own CV. There's probably some government recruitment company who has a list of people available for redeployment.  No CV is actually needed or required.  Not even as formality.  I'm sure they can just make somehing up.  Lord God Ashley PhD MD allllll the research outputs for Ashley snoockums.  And his motivational and aspiratinal a-politicality that means he can host the daily Bloomfield sh*t-show no matter who claims to have won the election.  Votes all uploaded to the cloud servers, I'm sure.  Counted by kim.com employees.  Of course.  What a f*cking joke.  Not even trying to be fair at all.</p>

                                <p>The hold up is that there aren't any doctors in the hospital.  I think the situation is that they don't have any on nights, so anybody who presents outside the 9-5 will have to wait until the doctors arrive the next day at 9.  Or probably the students, I guess.  The NZ Universities will be getting money from them for having them enrolled and they can practice their 'clinical skills' giving them needle stick injuries, sending away for urine and blood tests the patients never consented to, and the like.  I think that is part of it.  It's just a holding pen becuase they won't employ staff.  The studnets can play school for a while while they pay the university they pay the univesrity they pay the university.  They can be all playing coy and hide the identification badge if the patients try and figure out who is actually in the hospital...  Whether that person really is a nurse (really is their nurse) or whether they are just some random person pretending to be nurse and meh, the hospital will allow it, so long as it doesn't have to pay them.  They advertise and readvertise and readvertise but they haven't found the next Dr Leeks yet.  And everybody knows the job of the people who do the hiring is to find the next Dr Leeks and cover for their crimes.</p>

                                <p>It isn't my saying this stuff that undermines faith in our government institutions.  It is the fact that stuff like this is happening and the paid government workers think that their job is to 'perception manage' rather than actualy put things actually right.  If they could drug the entire nation into believing everything was just happy happy joy joy while they marched people off to the death camps they would be singing triumphant songs and patting each other on the back for a job well done.  No f*cking coception of what they are even supposed to be doing.  For public confidence to be justified, I mean to say.  F*cking chickens f*cking animals peck peck peck peck peck it's soooooooooo competitive!  The undermining of everything . Race to tohe bottom. What's that Sterelny? The costly fitness trap that NZ is (must be)  by design.</p>

                                <p>Alright, so here's a thing.  Lets say the University of Waikato has this scummy scam idea of keeping studnets enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled for more and more and more fees and never getting their work out for external examination and never allowing the externals to sign off on completion of the qualification.  THey want to hire a law firm to write a report on whether this is lawful or not.  More particularly, they actually want a lawyer to write them a report saying that their proposed course of action is within the law.  Then, the idea goes, if they are asked to defend themselves in a court of law they can then pull out that legal document and say that they were acting under the advise of legal counsel that their proposed course of action was likely lawful. </p>

                                <p>So...  How to find a lawyer who will write that various things that are obviously not within the law are actually acceptable?  Well, you could simply hire...  All the major firms in the region?  There aren't that many, in Hamilton.  Get each of them to write a legal advise report.  Maybe even get them to write it for no pay or for only $1 on the understanding (wink wink) that no further work will come there way (maybe their qualifications will no longer be acknowledged) if they write a report that says it likely is not within the law.  </p>

                                <p>But the real issue that I want to raise is one that was actually considered by the high ups in law.  I say it here so that the average person of average intelligence can understand how the law profession undermines itself.  They wanted to say that the reports that were written (as to the legaility of the situation) were property or owned by the Univesrity.  That is or means to say, if the Univesrity of Waikato got all of the major firms to write them a report on the legality of the thing and, let's say, 14 out of 15 firms says 'likely not lawful) and 1 out of 15 firms finds some pretty pretty pretty junior who will only get to graduate if she writes, for her summer internship, that it's likely okay...  Then the idea is that the University owns all of the reports as it's intellectual property.  That is or means to say, the firms who recomended aginst that course of action are bound by confidentiality or privacy or client attorney privalede or whatever not to disclose that they recommended against the court of action. Also, becuase they had offered advise to the University they were now conflicted out of having anything to do with legal action against them.  I mean to say, law in NZ actually seemed to think that the present situation is acceptable where the present situation is that by putting $1 in all of the pockets you make yourself immune to prosecution and everyone who you paid $1 to cannot give evidence against you.  Corruption.</p>

                                <p>The Law Society undermines itself and the entire profession in NZ (there is nothing here) when it refused to investigate the conflict with Mr and Mrs Cornege representing both prosecution and defence on several different cases as they were going through the court of Appeal. This was particularly concerning because an issue that was raised was the personal safety of various government employees in Texas who were involved in prosecuting a case of money laundering.  It was concerning that one of the Corneges might have access to information as to the identity of people involved in prosecuting while the other of the Corneges might financially profit from passing that information on to their client.  I guess because the lawyers job is to get their client off.  Right?  If that means they tell them who the witnesses are so that they can arrange for them to be whacked or whatever...  This is how NZ plays at law, is it?  It's like f*cking play school land...  It's been gutted entirely..  Nothing here..  THe intellectual, ur, uh..  Ability?  Of those at the highest level...  Um...  Yeah....</p>

                                <p>https://www.newsroom.co.nz/torture-in-paradise 'As the Crown's top lawyer in charge of Crown Law, Jagose's job was always to protect the Crown's interests'.  False.  Her job was to uphold justice.  That is why you are supposed to bow before the insignia of the Crown on the wall behind the judge when you go into the Court room.  You aren't bowing before the Judge, you are bowing before the ideal of Justice.  The Judge, the lawyers, are supposed to be united in serving or working towards the upholding of the ideal of justice.  The Judge is also supposed to bow.  The judge is supposed to be educated enough to know that the f*cking insignia is on the f*cking wall behind them.  You can tell whether you have a good judge or not, often, by whether the judge is gloating at you thinking that you are bowing before them or whether the judge is willing to bow with you in the interests of justice.  Her job was never to scapegoat the children in order to protect an offender who the Crown chose to employ and associate itself with.  Her job was never to cover for Dr Leeks.  To repeat:  We don't have a justice system.  At the highest f*cking levels they have no idea what the hell it is that they are even supposed to be doing.  F*cking stupid chickens.</p>

                                <p>To repeat.  A lawyers job is not to lie to the Judge to protect their client.  Their job is to represent the client to ensure that the judge is considering the relevant laws and considering the actual evidence on the merits or weight of the evidence.  I guess that's why the Judges think that without a lawyer they are allowed to make claims in their judgments of my cases that ignore the laws that I brought before them and make false claims about evidence that they did not receive (that they did in fact) and that thehy did receive (that they did not in fact).  For example, Justice Toogood is incapable of understanding that the TEC defines 1 EFT of study (as 34 weeks).  Rather, Justice Toogood preferred his own definition whereby you work for at least 12 months before undergoing 2x 3 months external examination and re-enrolment of 6 months.  Yeah, that's what 1 EFTS means.  Is he employed for 1 FTE then, is he?  How much do they pay him for that, then?  Do they pay him weekly, do they?  </p>

                                <p>There is nothing here.</p>

                                <p>It doesn't matter what any of the laws are when the courts refuse to uphold the laws.  The whole thing is just a complete and utter joke.  The judges won't uphold the laws.   I mean...  Una Jagose thinks that her job is to cover up Dr Leeks crimes so that he can keep being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars per year  by the government to offend against children.  She thinks that her job is to cover up for his crimes to enable his offending, to keep him on government payroll for as long as she can  before they arrange for him to be redeployed to Melbourne.  So he can earn Australian dollars, now, from the government, to continue on offending against Australians, now.  And he's celebrated as a hero, practically.  All this work that everybody is doing appointing him into position and working only to enable and support him in his offending.  That's what justice is or means, is it?  It's the government covering up the crimes of the offenders and doing everything they can to support the offenders in their offending.  In f*cking upside down and back to front land.  Throw away all the applications from anybody else who wanted to be a doctor or a psychiatrist.  Throw away all the applications from anybody else who wanted to work that job.  So that Dr Leeks is the only game in town.  Everything it is that we value.  What law?  What health?  There's nothign here.  They undermine themself.  Appointed into position only for their role in preventing and prohibiting anybody from actually doing the actual f*cking job.  We don't get to have a competent head of law.  We get stuck with Una.  F*cking incompetent.  Doesn't even know what her f*cking job is.</p>

                                <p>https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2023/03/attendance-data-dispute-over-whether-kids-skipping-school-without-proper-excuse-is-up-or-down.html  Hmmm... Well, I think most kids have been in classes where they school has intentionally and knowingly hired pedophiles or bullies to pass themselves off as teachers.  Turned a blind eye to victimisation of students.  Turned a blind eye to students bullying other students.  To death, in some instances.  I think most studnets will have experienced the teachers being unfair in the way the go about grading their work or seeing how the teachers go about grading the work of other students in the class.  Playing favorites with their kids or their friends kids or the administrations kids.  Getting some kids to do other kids work for them (putting them into group working situations where they are expected to allow others to copy them).  Refusing to fairly grade.  In some instances even failing them so that they will  be required to repeat the year and do other students work for them the next year, too, otherwise there will be no way through for them, at all.  Maybe look at these things...  Do they count as 'good' or 'justified reasons' for not going to school?  Isn't that the point or purpose of treating the kids that way?  To teach them that school and academics and paid employment is not for them?  That they have been picked out to be little b*tch or slave or lowest of the lowest of the low on the peck peck peck peck pecking order.  For the f*cking animals who they pay..  Do they?  Do they pay them?  Or do they intentinoally seek out pedophilees nad bullies and offenders because they won't complain if they don't get paid at all to victimise and pimp out and bully the kids?  Do these count as 'good reasons' for not going to school?  Or are these bad reasons.  Bad kids.  They choose to be positioned in society where the only way through for them is smashing people over the back of the head and taking their stuff.  The Governmetn wouldn't allow for things to be any other way.  No functioning judiciary.  No functioning education system.  Too corrupt.  Stupid f*cking chickens.</p>

                                <p>https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2023/03/auckland-health-workers-say-they-re-screwed-following-emergency-department-overflow.html  You forgot the worst of it.  If you get the UN inspectors going into the hospital and opening locked doors they are likely going to find a bunch of 'patients' who are being unlawfully involuntarily detained in conditions amounting to torture.  Likely a bunch of people being kept sick by the people who were only hired because of their known history doing such things overseas.  So they can claim to have the beds fill and maximum billings etc from ACC.  They are sending ACC false information about the reason the are keeping patients and they refuse to correct their records.  Medical Doctors are not signing off on patients notes.  Not clinically trained administration is making the decisions.  Corruption.  Corruption.  Corruption.  It actually does make sense to divert ambulances, particularly in major urban centres like Auckland, to the hospital that has the least patients in the ED.  In the US ambulances would see who the patient was insured with before deciding what hospital to take them to and they had developed logistics to the point where they could divert to another hospital in case of emergency.  Like air planes ffs.  Diverting to another airport if one is having problems.  Of course since this is NZ and  it's soooooo competitive, I mean corrupt, I mean competitive, I mean corrupt, they likely will end up doing some sort or kind of two tiered system where if Ashley snookums needs to go to the ER  he will get diverted to the one with the fluffy towels.  Unlike the likes of you or me.  Social hierarchy and all that.  Who would want to end up in a hospital when you  have the likes of Ashley peck peck peck f*cking pecking to establish his position on the social hierarchy where he gets to piss all over everyone else, anyway?  I don't know how or why he would expect the 'medical staff' not to see him as a direct competitor and peck peck peck peck peck  him to f*cking death.  It's soooooooooooo competitive.  No? Just take a chill pill and it's the parents who go gunning so the kid can just blinky blink blink their big stupid eyes and pretend to be oblivious to the whole f*cking thing.  Yeah, right.  </p>

                                <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/opinion/131432839/a-message-to-those-who-have-suffered-slash-damage-the-courts-are-open  That what is open?  Oh, you should pay the courts and pay the courts and pay the courts, should you?  So the courts can make false statements of fact and ignore half the laws.  So the courts can say that you are 'techincally' or 'strictly' correct but that it's merely a technicality and therefore you should pay the courts pay the courts pay the courts pay the courts pay the courts pay teh courts pay the courts.  Hey, the other guy can file a motion to have your proceedings struck out so the courts can order you to refile your filings.  Refile your refiling of the filings.  Refile the refiling of the refiling of the refilings.  Delay and delay and procrastinate and order the issue to be changed from the one you brought before the courts into something different entirely.  Change the issue so that it isn't a matter of law, anymore, then accuse the applicant of bringing an issue before the courts that isnt' even about the law.  Hey, here is an idea.  Award $10,000 in damages and $30,000 in costs to tbe paid for the courts!  For the courts!  To say nothing of a $100,000 in fees to your lawyers, likely, otherwise they would never have scheduled a hearing of the issue the judge decided he wanted to hear (instead of the one that you brought) so that you can be ordered to pay the courts!  Pay the courts!  Pay the courts!  Never stop paying the 'courts' so they can pretend to be too f*cking stupid to do the job for which they are paid.  I am not undermining public confidence.  The actions of the courts undermine public confidence.  Read the judgments for yourself.  Completely lacking in integrity.  There's nothing there.  I guess it comes from them already knowing before they even put out an invitation for people to apply to Law School who is going to come out with Law Degrees.  So they know who gets picked out all special-like to entertain the partners at the firm party or do anything anything anyting to be signed off that internship or clerkship.  They undermine themselves. </p>

                                <p>If you have a social account then limit the viewership to your friends.  Problem sorted.  If you have a public account then, I suppose, you have a payrolled staff managing it.  I meant to say, does anybody really think that the President of the United States (for example) writes and manages his own Twit feed or Farcebook accounts?  Really?  You don't think he has other things to be doing with his time?</p>

                                <p>https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/money/2023/03/easy-tips-on-how-to-budget-your-money-if-you-get-paid-monthly.html  It is not hard to budget money if you get paid monthly.  It is hard to budget money if you get paid weekly.  You do not get paid the same.  The people who are paid weekly are those who barely have enough to live from week to week to week to week.  They think that nobody will actually starve in a week so it doesn't matter.  If they are supposed to get paid on Thursday it will take them until Friday to notice they didn't get paid then the office will be closed over the weekend. Security can turn them away on Monday and Tuesday then it is 'just one more day' until pay day again.  I don't think that our highest paid government welfare beneficiaries (e.g, the likes of Ashley Bloomfield) are paid fornightly or monthly because it is more difficult than it would be for him to manage weekly payments.  I think that something entirely different is going on.  Do you think it is harder to manage monthly bills wen you are paid weekly or monthly?  What do you think?  Just have a guess?  DO you think it is easier to manage 52 payments per year or 12?  What do you think?  Just take a f*cking stab at it.  The Judges get paid weekly do they?  The Government consultants?  Yeah, right.  Weekly pocket money is what you give your 10 year old.  The people kept retarded by the government.  Incapacitated.  Disabled.  Non-functional.  So that everybody can sit about singing the praises of almighty Judge Jury and Executioner God Chris Hipkins who KNows ALl Things including whether the invasion of the Ukraine was lawful or not without so much as a trial.  He undermines himself. </p>

                                <p>Do you think it is easier for the courts to manage one lot of filings or to manage refilings on the filings?  How about some re-refilings on the filings?   How  about a fourth hearing?  Because the courts don't have anything better to be doing with their time.  They want to hear the same case over and over and over and over while no new evidence is supplied to the court until the judges start asserting that evidence has been supplied to the courts that was never supplied.  Gaslighting only.  There does not appear to be a functioning judiciary. I suppose we can just ask Chris Hipkins, can we, whether something was lawful or not and he will tell us.  He will tell us whether the sitution in the Ukraine is lawful or not.  He will tell us.  We don't need to pay judges or lawyers and have a trial.  Guilty until proven innocent and no trial.  Just a retrial or a retrial of a retrial with 'judges' hauled out of retirement since they think the worst that can happen to them is that they be removed from office which is where they were before they were reappointed anyway.  Hahahhahahahha so much for rule by law or rule of law in the supposedly developed world.  Soooooo developed.  Soooooo developed.  ALl the intellectual property coming out of NZ.  All the technology.  Arts.  Nothing. Nothing, hey.  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>Aw, come on.  Everybody knows the health system is racist.  That is what they most insistently teach the first year students. The health system is racist, it's racist, it's racist, it's racist.  The idea seems to be to have them accept the reality (the description) as a motivational and aspirational ideology (therefore it must always be). At least come to terms with what everybody knows to be fact.  The health system is racist.  It makes racist decisions and it's untimely death-ing as many people as it can on entirely racist grounds.  That's what they determinedly and resolutely teach their first years.  Don't you want to join them?  Are you motivated and inspired?  Can't wait to see what more you get to learn about just how racist they aspire to be in subsequent years.  I'm sure it's completely world-leading.</p>

                                <p>Everybody knows only poor people fill out Stats NZ surveys.  They pay people to come to your house and tell you that you need to let the survey person inside your house.  You need to tell the survey person your answers to the survey questions (about your income and the like) and the survey person will fill out the form for you.  That's a good government job for the survey person.  To tell people that they are required to let them into their homes and tell them whatever personal information.  That's a good job for the survey person.  So the rich people play stupid and so on and worst case they just pay the fine for not filling out the survey.  That's what they do with the census forms too, right?  I mean...  Let's see...  The people want education  -- but there is no education.  The people want healthcare -- but there is no healthcare.  The people want meaningful jobs -- but the government has ideals about keeping slaves.  The goverment wants people to fill out census forms.  Yeah, right.  Don't forget to pay the government for your home detention, people.  Else the government might declare you mentally ill (like Janet Frame) or a terrorist (like Brian Tamaki).  Lock you up and throw away the key.  So the elected representatives from Malaysia can take control of the health system.  Yeah right.  Go blackbirding for slaves with Chris Whelan.  What a f*cking farce of a hoax of a joke.</p>

                                <p>What education and training system?  People get paid positions in NZ society never because of their having been educated or trained for anyting, at all.  People get paid positions in NZ soceity in spite of despite of and never because of.  Usually they are employed into position precisely because they have been identified as someone most likely to be most incompetent in fact.  Check out who they choose to hire into position as government paid human rights lawyers, for example.  Check out who they choose to hire into position as government prosecutors, for example.  Check out who they choose to hire into position as medical doctors for example.  Check out who they choose to hire into positon as university acdemics.  Really check it out.  I mean, you can't compre them to the other candidates  because they threw away the applications from other candidates so as to prevent and prohibit the comparison being made.  That is the best sense I can make of them throwing away applications to medical schools etc before they are all laid out before the medical admissions committee.  They don't throw them away because they think the application is so bad that they don't even need to consider it.  Rather, they throw the application away prematurely because they want to end up saying that htey simply had to hire the candidate that they did because they were the best option or alternative.  If that means they say they were the only eligible application then they will simply declare everyone else 'ineligible'.  If that means they have to refuse to supply applications to verious people so they never receive their application then they withhold applications.  The lengths they go to to hire people they know are not the best candidates for the positon.  That is why they are throwing applicaitons away and not considering them on their actual merits.  They don't throw them away because they are so very very bad that they aren't worth considering.  If they really are that  bad then it would be a good team-building exercise to start seeing that the entire committee is actually unanimous about the definite no's.  The reason you throw applications away before being considered by the committee is because they make your preferred candidates look bad.  Corruption.  It is corruption through nd through.  If the judiciary can't see or understand this then the judiciary is declaring itself to be corrupted.  Cortuption.  Through and through.  I guess they would only hire the people who lacked the willingness or ability to parse the Australain consittiution.  I guess that must  be it.  Apparently any law graduates capable of functioning independently will never be signed off to do so by supervisors.  That's right.  They hvae to get in behind incompetent supervisors until they've all been exterminated or eliminated or killed off.  If that means that we skip a generation or two or three then off to the death camps with you.  Justice Toodood wants to be judge for another 40 years.  Who is going to stop him? </p>

                                <p>It would be terrific, wouldn't it, if all the civil servants could actually get on with doing the job for which they are so very very very very very well paid.  But instead they choose to declare war on the people by refusing to do any of the things for which they are paid.  The prevention and prohibitnon of thei rjob being filled by someone competent nad willing to do it.  Chris Whelan.  Not processed a single complaint of wrongdoing since he was deployed into office.  For that they pay him half a million per year.  The VC's of various NZ uniersities.  Most often deployed from overeseas to refuse to process applicatons to enrol, progressions through training, graduations.  Refusing to get work to externals.  Refusing to sign off on completion.  Refusing to publically advertise paid employment.  Refusing to hire the people with the knowledge and experience for the job (e.g, Professors and so on.  Ashley Bloomfield does not have an MD or a PhD he does not have research output but primary function of university acadmeics is supposed to be research output.  What research output?  Nobody home.  Nothing there).</p>

                                <p>Pathology Laboratory entry level job.  Hours:  Midnight until 6am.  2 days per week.  Who are they hiring for that job?  Apparently they are looking for a student.  A student enrolled in a medical laboratory science degree from Auckland or Otago.  Probably a student from Otago might have difficulty getting the relevant flights and transporting themselves from the airport.  Or maybe some students can catch an airlift from Dunedin to Auckland a couple times per week?  But of course they aren't actually going to pay anybody to fill that position.  It's an unpaid slave volunteer job that you do for...  Let's see...  For...  One semester?  Two semesters?  Two years?  2 decades?  Because they never will acknowledge that you have completed your qualification becuase then they would have to pay you.  And why would they pay you when you keep paying the university.  You pay the university.  You pay the university.  You pay the university.  You pay the university.  Oh.  Are you done paying the univeristy?  Time for you to die, then.  Just curl up and f*ckign go away.  Done.  Thanks for playing.  Hahaha.  Better luck next generation.  Your kiddies paying the univesrity, yet?  How many slaves did you bring to us?  There isn't anything in New Zealadn because there isn't a functioning economy at all.  Something something about Australia choosing to have New Zealand dollars printed in Canada to obscure that Australia wont' even supply NZ cizens with wages.  There isn't anything here.</p>

                                <p>I would imagine the point of the pathology position is that even if they did pay the worker minimum wage (but they likely won't, they'll say it is an internship that must  be successfully completed before they will sign off on completion of the degree) they would collect the money back in teh form of the student needing to pay for parking or needing to undergo a lengthy commute that means they won't be able to be well rested for their classes.  That way they can fail them by saying their class work is not up to standard. The idea being that the entire qualification is a hoax or a fraud, I mean to say.  Tehy won't be graduating anybody from the qualification when they can simply get students doing the work for free, effectively.  NZ does not have an education and training system.  We have a slavery system.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>If it cannot  be done by someone with no relevant education and training then it will not be done at all.  It will not be found here.</p>

                                <p>Most of the jobs that are advertised don't say how much they are going to pay the person who fills the job.  The Government agencies and departments say that 'privacy' means they don't have to tell the public how much government money they pay a government employee in the form of salary.  I mean to say employees of the public universities, hospitals and so on.  They refuse to say how much they pay people.  They are not keeping accurate records of the FTE.  They are not keeping accurate records of the EFTS.  They are not keeping accurate records of where the money goes.  The govenrment doesn't even bother to collect most of the tax money that's actually supposed to collect while it cries about how poor it is (according to first year Law academics, at any rate).  Though...  Maybe that's how the first year Law academics try and market law to students.  Indicating to them that if they study law they will never have to pay any taxes.   But it won't even collect most of the tax money that it's supposed to collect.  Just f*cking incompetent.  That's the  basic problem.  Just f*cking incompetent.  The prevention and prohibition of social development.  By design.  Intentionally engineered to be.  But of course the Australian Government isn't responsible  because they are too f*cking stupid to parse their own consittution.  And 'New Zealander' isn't a significant cultural group or an ethnicity or whatever so we can't cry cry cry about it being racist that Australia treats NZers as second or third class citizens (denying passports, birth certificates, denying government employment, refusing to to process applications for enrolment, progresseion through trianing, completion of training).  Too stupid to read the constitution.  Too f*cking stupid.  Yeah, right.  </p>

                                <p>So Ayesha has a MBChB from Otago?  But they will only acnowledge that she does because she does not work with patients.  Is that right?  Did she pay them money to apply to register to practice to work with patientes?  How much money did she pay them in application to work with patient fees?  Did they refuse to register her, did they?  The University will only say that she has a MBChB because she will never be paid to see or work with patients.  We don't have any medical doctors.  We redeploy them to...  What's she doing now?  Making decisions on political or personal grounds.  But that's the only way decisions get made.  Did she pay international sutdent fees to do MBChB?  Or did she pay for citizenship and get expediated through as a domesetic student?  Did she complete her 1 year MPhil from a NZ university which made her 'eligible', then?  Let's see her first year university examination scripts, then, if she was selected on the basis of her first year academic performance.  Or was she selected as an 'other' or 'alternative' candidate?  Was that accompanied by a political or personal donation?  How does that work, exactly.  I'm sorry..  How is it that NZ does not work, exactly.  Trying to get a handle on how things are kept so f*cking garbage in this stupid-land.  Does she travel with Chris Whelan as his wing-man to help him blackbird for Malaysian nurses?  Trying to persuade people in Malaysia to give Chris their children along with a dowry to the University or maybe a private school or two in NZ along the way.  Vague promises of them becoming a nurse or a doctor or a..  Massage therapist.  So they can get their parents and family out to join them in NZ however many years later.  So they can go into delightful aged care facilities in nZ in their old age).  Does she travel to Malaysia on taxpayers dime, much?</p>

                                <p>So some people get told 'hey, you better drop me a CV for that job I was going to give you.  Just a formality, you know.  Other people get told 'we would rather re-advertise the position than give it to the likes of you' so you can see that they don't interview you, even, they simply re-advertise the position the very next day.  Because I'm clearly grossly unsuitable for cleaning surgical equipment.  Clearly.  The best person for the job is, um, well, you describe the ideal candidate, then.  Oh, it's a student.  Someone who pays the hospital to keep their mouths shut about how they aren't paying anyone to keep the surgical equipment fit for surgery.  Apparently there are all these qualified surgeons working in the hospitals who have no care at all for the state of their surgical equipment.  Yeah, right.  Does that seem even slightly plausible to anybody?  Do chefs hand over their knives to dishwashers who pay the restaurant who pay the restaurant who pay the restaurant who pay the restaurant to shut the f*ck up about the state of the back of house, do they?  Does that sound or seem like a functioning health system to you?  Let the UN inspectors into the sterile supply rooms.  Let the manufacturers of the equipment check that the equipment has been properly installed and is being used within the manufactuers guidelines.  The courts won't uphold that qualfied electricians need to hardwire heaters / that it is not acceptable for a landlord to get a builder to hardwire the electrical socket in a manner contrary to manufacatuers installation manual for the purposes of claiming to have a permanent fixture heater (all 80watts of it) in the house.  There's nothing here...  The f*ckign idots have taken over.  What a f*cking farce of a joke of a hoax of a scummy scummy scam.  What rule by law?  You and whose army?  No hint of 'try'.  </p>

                                <p>Get rid of the Pharmac Chairman on entirely personal or political grounds?  But Pharma is doing such a wonderful job of ensuring that New Zealanders are not able to access many of the medications that are accessible to Australians and Canadians and people from the UK and the USA.  New Zealand functions, basically or effectively, as the 'no treatment' arm on the international or global research.  What happens when you observe no treatment.  Cheapest health system ever.  Most of the costs go into the active persecution and involuntary incarceration wrongful deathbringing and sexual offending done in the name of 'observing me help myself to you'.  I mean, what do you expect when you can't / won't process applications to enrol, progressions through training, you won't sign off on training completion.  Won't publically advertise jobs, won't employ anyone qualfied to do them.  But even if you did, you wouldn't pay them.  And even if you paid them there is no way that you would miss an opportunity to micromismanage them into preventing and prohibiting them from doing their job.  All the work teh energy the effort expended in the prevention and prohibition of development programme.  Khan Academy is wrong when their sociology people maintain that it is simply the lack of organisation that results in apparent evil.  I disagree.  I think there is evidence of an actual force preventing and prohibiting and confusing and obstructing and denying.  I mean to say, take a look at the outputs of the courts.  All the busy-work they make for themselves insisting on refiling and refiling and rehearing and rehearing.  Consider the University.  Insisting on refiling and refiling and resubmitting and rehearing.  Can't do / won't do that which is their primary function.  It is like they have actually been appointed to ensure that that particular thing is never done.  Not by them and in fact they have been put into position precisely for the purpose of them preventing and prohibiting that from being done by anyone.  By design.  The slave prison detention camp not-developed nothing garbage land.  By design.  By the will of our soverign leaders, apparently.  The only ones who will be acknowledged as leaders by international community.  Of course.  I'm sure they do what they do all voluntary-like.  Yeah nah.  </p>

                                <p>Quickly quickly quickly better readvertise the readvertisement of the readvertising of the government jobs overseas.  We only got 2x or 3x or 4x or 5x the number of people apply than there were (allegedly) available positions.  That's however much money in visa processing fees for the government!  They will never give the job to a New Zealander.  They have New Zealanders positioned on the social hierarchy where they want them to be, already.  They are interested in blackbirding for new recruits from overseas.  You better hand over some money for visa processing.  ONly for them to tell you (last minute like) that htey don't acknowledge your training and qualifications and you will need to enrol (reenrol reenrol reenrol) in an education and training course in New Zealand where you work the job while you pay international studnet fees to the university.  Until we decide it's time to lock you up in the  name of psychiatry and then give you opportunity to flee...  Hahahahhahaha nice doing 'business' in New Zealand.  There's nobody home.  Nothing here.  By design.  Even Amnesty International isn't pretending to have an Auckland Office anymore.  They used to pretend to have an office in Auckland on Queen Street where, they told me, you could go complain about how other countries are keeping NZers overseas.  But you could certainly not complaint about how NZ was keeping people in NZ. Said the French girl in the front desk.  I asked her what she did, then, working for Amnesty International in NZ.  She said 'policy'.  I asked to see the policy that the NZ office had written, then.  But, um, uh, er.  I suppose she was an unpaid volunteer for Amnesty International NZ branch precisely so that she could prevent and prohibit anybody from NZ from writing any policy on the subject.  That sounds like the Kiwi way.  How things would be in upside down land.</p>

                                <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/300823131/minimum-wage-should-be-even-higher-union-says-as-inflation-erodes-increase  Just so we are clear:  Any increase for you is only going to result in your relative positioning being worse and also more firmly entrenched.  Comprehend.  Aye???  Or too stupid to understand that bashy bashy to the back of the skull till no elite ruling class exist anymore is the only alternative.  Only game in town.  Comprehend.  Aye???</p>

                                <p>So people other than me have said that the trouble is that we are presently living in the intellectually or culturally dark ages. And that actually makes a lot of sense. I feel like there are various things that I can pay money to in a 'paying it back' kind or sort of a way. But there are no future prospects, at all.  The previous generation was starved out of not being paid and there is no preesent or future...  Nothing here.  Nothing at all.</p>

                                <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/485417/hipkins-defends-public-sector-spending-on-consultants-contractors  And what does your Mummy DO chris? I heard she was high up in the Minstry of Education and you were (therefore) high up in the Minstry of Education too (despite or in spite of your merits).  Then, somehow there is sense to be had in your giving up your ministry of education job for life in order for you to become supposed or alleged elected representative for the labor party.   Because that's what people do.  They give up jobs for life with the ministry in exhange for elected representive positons.   Because you will have to get out if National win the election (yeah, right).  See how there is  nothing there, in NZ.  How electoins do not matter.  How people give up public sector jobs to be elected representatives with no risk.  What a face of a hoax of a scum of a scam...</p>

                                <p>Remembering...  When I was a kid (teenager).  Mufti day was a Big Event (day you get to wear clothes of 'your choosing' not your school uniform).  Option 1 was Levis.  Option 2 was Shanton Factory Shop that was 2nd Rate or Option, or whatever compared to Levis.  Anything else was...  Uh... Ur...  Um....  You lose.</p>

                                <p>And of course you paid the school in order to get to wear mufti at all.  You paid them.  A dollar or two to put on your $30 shanton factory shop or yout 110 dollar levis of your..  Uh..  Er...  Nothing else...</p>

                                <p>Which is clearly how NZL is going to develop the capacity to make it's own antibiotics etc.... Or, ur.. Actually not.. For all of the things that it values.
                                </p>

                                <p>So, there is a decidedly fishy move that needs to be made.  And you heard it here, first (6 March 2023).  The X box controller has the X button on the left of the decidedly squishy buttons on the right side of the controller.  The Nintendo pro controller has the X button on the top of the wonderfully clicky buttons on the right side of the controller.  The playstation has the X button on the  bottom of the somewhat squishy buttons on the right side of the controller. </p>

                                <p>There is another conroller in logical space, therefore!  One wish positioning for the x button to be on the right of the, preferably clicky buttons to the right of the controller.  You heard it here first.  Kelly Roe copyright 2023 as of March. Just saying.  No I didn't file the patient.  Corruption.  Corruption.  Corruption.  That's the obvious only position that is left.</p>

                                <p>I am saying...  That Steamdeck dropped the motherf*cking ball on their controller layout.  They should have gone with the option remaining in logical space for the fourth configuration.  Just saying. But you  heard it here first.  Just saying.  Anybody who designs any controller system with the button on the right...  You heard it  here first.  Course you did.  I'm sure it wasn't obvious to almost everyone.</p>

                                <p>But Bill Fish is a disjunctivist (who nobody respectable will be and it's the last remaining position in logical space) and as baby fish I'm required to be a dim approximation of him however many years behind.  Clearly.  Him being from England and all.  Must have for Massey.  No Philosophy PhDs from NZL.   Must hire from England.  Clearly...</p>

                                <p>Wasn't there an Indian couple...  The husband taught English ESL and the wife worked in some administration capacity for Auckland Pharmacology.  There was a photograph of their son wearing a graduate gown.  Apparently he graduated Engineering from Massey.  Only, they say that he killed his parents so now he lives in a psychiatric facility in NZ forever.  I don't know how much money they got various people from India to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay to do ESL courses and to have visa applications in.  How  much they paid for property in the grammar zone.  How much they paid to be acepted to study or maybe even declared graduated from various courses on pharmacology.  Don't know how much they paid to be put to work manufacturing LSD for Auckland University while they paid and paid and paid the University...  New Zealand dream, right there.  Never will pay him to work as an Engineer.  He can live in the Psych hospital.  What's he going to do about it?  Maybe document their crimes.  Have the psych hospitals developed or progressed at all since they housed the likes of Janet Frame?  When it was time to pay her to be a teacher they thought they would prefer to keep her slaving in the psych ward for no pay in appalling conditions.  It's quite the New Zealand dream or reality or something.  Not to have developed or grown or anything at all in the last 50 years +++  Stagnate.</p>

                                <p>I mean the schools (also the universities) got rid of external examination else they reduced the role of external examination so that the internal people, the people in position to know who the kids daddies were etc, were the ones deciding their grades.  That means to say, the students work is not being externally examined on the basis of it's academic merits.  Rather, the schools are making decisions about which studnets they want to keep around (e.g., make them repeat the year) and so on on personal or political grounds.  That is to say, there isn't an education and training system.  They aren't trying to educate and train people for academics such as reading, writing, arithmetic.  Rather, the aim the goal the purpose, the point, is to tell a certain segment that academics is not for them and they need to wake up to their slave position in life.  That seems to be the primary purpose aim goal point or function of the education system of NZ.</p>

                                <p>They are not willing or able to design a fair test of academic achievement.  Because there are various people on massive salaries who would fail those tests.  And they quite like to keep their slaves a-slaving.  And it is 'trickle down economics', apparently, where some people who aren't willing and or able to learn or study academics get to enslave those willing and able and just basically take a great piss over everyone else.  Like the statue they put up at the Auckland Domain.  This god-figure taking a piss over everyone else.  It's supposed to motivate and inspire people to..  Uh..  Study hard because Medicine is for the academics? Was it?  They say that they don't choose students because their grades aren't good enough.  If that means they refuse to do the math according to their published instructions on how the math is to be done.  I guess that's the only reason why they employed them into those jobs.  Because they can't do it?  Because they won't do it.  Because they won't do it.  You should see how they clean their science data.  The voting papers.  Everything else.  Not worth the paper it's not even printed on anymore.  See how they clean the university transcripts, now.  The medical records.  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>I am sure it's not hard to find cases where the NZ education system asserts that a studnet can't do math, say...  But the student is doing math just fine on Khan Academy (say) since Sal Khan isn't repeatedly telling them that their function is to be slave earning negative numbers only.  Instead, it just sort of gets with the programme (mostly or at least sometimes) of teachign the content in understandable ways.  I'm sure it's not hard to find cases where the NZ education system asserts that student can't do English or can't think critically or doesn't understnd first year chemistry, population health, second year pathology...  It isnt' hard to find examples where they are talking or writing with various people from overesas about their understanding of the content and they understnd it just fine.  Obviously and clearly.  New Zealand isnt' even trying to have an education and training system at all.  It is trying to traffick in slaves.</p>

                                <p>So that the children of the administration can be expediated through into their positions high up the social hierarchy where they are paid enough money to keep slaves.  Then they can take the slaves work and pass it off as their own taking credit for it else traffick it give it away or sell it to other slavers to pass off as their own.  If they have to put these kids into group work environments so that other kids can do their work for them until they put them on payroll in group work environments again so they can take the work outputs of others.  Because they wouldn't be willing to spend the time learning and studying and working towards understanding.  They have no interest in academics.  Therefore they must be redeployed into positions as academic leaders to make sure the entire enterprise is prevented and prohibited and undermined on their watch.  No outputs or products of academia.  Not on their watch.</p>


                                <p>The NCEA maths one that they posted that had a lot of questions about ACC.  Where the labels on the axis were different in meaning from the wording in the questions.  That one was intentionally designed to be stupid.  To be a stupid question.  A stupid test.  The only reason I can think of is so that the parents feel forced to pay for Cambridge Curriculum becuase NCEA is obviously a hoax of a farce of a joke.  Or maybe because the people on payroll to design the tests are speaking out against the tests they are required to design the only way they know how (by making it public that they are required to design stupid tests only).  How do some kid do amazingly well in it given the questions?  They must be cheating.  Being given the right answers else their incorrect answers being changed.  Many of the University assessments are similarly bad.  Pathology at Otago, for example.  The second year course.  The questions were ill formed.  When the lists asserted that some studnets were getting grades in the high 90's it was obvious that the thing was some kind of farce.  Not even trying to be a fair test that was worth studying for.  That's the point of it, I suppose.  To tell people that studying for it is pointless or worthless.  So that people give up on learning the content.  So then the content can be removed from the classes.  Just one step away from ushering everyone into the building that has been gutted of assets, baring the door, and setting the entire thing on fire.  Like how they used to do.  Just one step away from something like that.  See...  If you have a multiple choice test with three obviously wrong answers and it's a toss up between one or the other of the two remaining...  It comes down to a 50/50 scenario on whether you get it right or not.  Chance.  No better than chance.  And if, say, half the paper is like that...  THen if you hear that very many people are getting more than 75 % on the test..  Or you hear that a handful or two are getting grades in the high 90's then you know that something corrupt is going on with the students cheating else the graders not grading things correctly.  When the third year pathology class asks us to name parts of bone that are not given a name in any textbook that I had ever seen (not named in teh lectures or the tutorials) -- but aparently some studnets got that question right?  Or maybe the administration altering the grades before they are released.  That's typically why they won't release the answers and the grading shedule to the students.  So that the students can't see that they aren't grading the tests properly.  Cels at Otago I was allowed a closed viewing and there were a couple cases of them marking me wrong when the grading schedule said I got them correct.  The effect of that was to cheat me out of an A+ for the course and only give me an A.  I asked the convenor to grade it properly and properly record my grade and she said she would speak with the lecturer about it then said that he said 'no'.  I mean to say, they are not grading studnets work properly.  It isn't that the students are too stupid (well, the children of the administration likely are in fact) it is that they have pre-decided who they want to be slaves.</p>

                                <p>What really happens to your census data? Well, first they have to clean it.  That means they go through and change the answers that they don't like into answers that they prefer.  So, for example, if you were to write 'New Zealander' in the ethnicity place they would change your answer so that you are recorded or counting as 'NZ European'.  That is just one example that we have been informed of where the NZ government workers are paid to change the answers into ones they prefer.</p>

                                <p>The origins of it, as best I can figure, are that the NCEA maths study books typically start the statistics section with a little blurb on the need to 'clean your data'.  They give the example of providing a survey to the class and someone writes 'yes' and someone else writes 'both' and someone else writes 'please' but the only answers that will be heard are 'M' or 'F'.  So you need to ignore the answers that you deem to be invalid.  Else change them into something acceptable to you.    </p>

                                <p>I wonder how many will claim to have PhD's from NZ Universities where the Universities refuse to acknowledge that.  Maybe because they have the power to deem PhD's expired (the qualification no longer valid) after 5 years?  Was it?  That's what Auckland University thinks of all the NZ University qualifications.  That they expire 5 years post-graduation.  They don't need to acknowledge them anymore.  Except, of course, the high up administration people who acknowledge themselves.  Or maybe they don't.  Maybe they were only deployed into those positions (typically from overseas) precisely because they don't have any actual university qualifications at all...  Seems the most likely explanation as to why it is that they won't allow anybody else to have the qualifications and they won't allow anybody else to have positions appropriate to them.  You wouldn't think it would be so bad.   I mean, they could simply go back to school and get the qualifications and then they would be qualified.  Only they know that the whole thing is garbage and if they went back they wouldn't get the qualifications no matter how bright they were and no matter how hard they worked.  Since there isn't anything there at all.  Just a f*cking slave prison detention camp.</p>

                                <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/131408078/shopper-discovers-discounted-mountain-warehouse-jacket-priced-20-higher-online  See, what happens is that the 'employees' pay their 'employer' so that they can claim to have status as employed' rather than 'unemployed' and some of the money that the employer makes can thereby be passed on to the consumer in the form of savings.  Yeah, right.  See, what happens is that first they close the physical stores, and then they close the online stores.  Also, since you don't have a convenient place to return not fit for purpose goods you are lumped with them.  Then they could simply not deliver your order.  Say that the NZ post people stole it since they won't pay the NZ postal workers they have to find their money from somewhere.  Like the ambulance officers who they won't sign off on completion of their training of so that certain other special snowflakes can distribute the Fentnyl as they see fit.  See how much money they can get to release the person from their ambulance custody.  How long they can get away with unlawfully detaining them outside the hospital?  At the end of the street?  At the end of the block?  In an 'ambulance bay' somewhere?  Apparently it is 'private' who is on payroll and how much they are payrolled for.  The public sector government jobs.  It's all very very private and confidental.  </p>

                                <p>Wondering, now, how many of our party list politicians were born overseas else spent the majority of their education and early career overseas.  Jacinda was off early to the USA (on exhange -- who did we trade her with?) then England?  So she gets pension over there??  Ricardo.  Born in Mexico.  Likely not a refugee given the time he spends in Mexico.  Ayesha.  Malaysia.  And so on.  Where does all the money go?  Half a million for Una Jagose.  Half a million for Ashley.  Half a million for the VC of each of the 'universities' of NZL.  Where does all the money go?  Canterbury DHB (actually it should have been forwarded to the new government ministry now) is refusing to say how much they paid the 10 days orthopedic surgeon before his wife is put in Hillmorton indefinately (who pays for that)? And apparently it isn't in her interests to appear before the courts.  Says the only people on government payroll to get to have an opinion on such things?  How much did him and his wife pay for their visas and so on?  WHere are their children now?  Died, apparently...  Says who?  Evidence?   </p>

                                <p>'Wilson's Parking' is an Australian company.  Right?  So all the money for parking and all the money for parking tickets and fines get paid to Australia for developing the land into a parking facility.  Is that right?  Wlson's Parking.  That you find doing the parking at the NZ Government places. The public Universities.  The public Hospitals.  Places where Government workers are on payroll to work government jobs.  Does all that money really go directly to Australia?  But NZ governemnt is soverign, are they?</p>

                                <p>They were trying to get people to be 'students' rather than workers.  Instead of people going into jobs they wanted to hold or keep them in what they wanted to say were 'tertiary education training programmes'.  That way the flow of money goes in the reverse direction, you see.  From the individual to the government rather than from the government to the individual.  Then the government got greedy 'how low can we go'?  And instead of them allowing the students to progress through their training programme, sign them off or acknowledge them as having completed their training programme, and employing them into paid positions to do what they were doing for low to no wages or for levels of debt against their name only while they were detained or held s students...  They started refusing to acknowledge they had completed their training.  Recording higher and higher levels of debt against their name.  Recording that they were reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled.  Keeping them as slaves prisoners.  Detainees.  How low can we go? </p>

                                <p>So they have gotten used to this idea that you don't pay workers.  Rather, you get studnet slaves to work the job for no pay.  Medical Doctors, nurses, even sterile supply technicians.  All the job.  They simply don't exist anymore.  They put 'students' to work working the jobs for free.  They say 'work the job for a while while we assess your ability to do it competently' then they deem you not declared competent yet or whatever simply so that they don't pay you they don't pay you it isn't personal they don't pay anyone.  Unless they take pity on their own children or their mates.  The ones who persuade them that they love nothing more than to live in their basement and be slaves.  THey aren't slaves.  It's what they do willingly with a glad heart.  No...  That's not it.  Only the very very very very best ones must be kept unemployed slaves forever.  Of course.  Else they can die to be replaced by a new forever slave.  Of course.  Social hierarchy and all that.  If you aren't biding your time until you get slaves of your own then what is the point of you?  Oooooh just think of it!  You can do anything anything anything to slaves all of your own!  Steal their work and pass it off as yours, traffick the work (or the individual) to some other place.  Play swapsies.  Then when tehy come crying home to you about how badly they were kept overseas you can keep them in your basement forever awwwwwwwww.  See, that's what happens when you try and leave little slave-y.  Dont you know how lucky you are!!!</p>

                                <p>To repeat:  The government is not hiring people for jobs like 'sterile supply techincian'.  Suposed to be an entry level job (bit like being a dishwasher in food service, actually).  They train you on the job.  They pay you they pay you they pay you.  Only things are far too corrupt for that and they don't actually pay anybody to do it very much or very well at all.  I would iamgine that more sinister things are going on now or because of or whatever...  Maybe the autoclaves don't function.  Maybe they aren't doing it properly for whatever reasons..  Won't do it properly.  Too busy trying to kill people with the 'surgeries' or whatever.  So they wont' let UN inspectors into the hospital.  ANd they need to be careful to only let the lowest of the lowest of the low in to work those jobs.  People who will keep their mouths shut about what is actually going on in the hospitals.  Do you see?  Corruption...  Corruption...  Corruption...</p>

                                <p>Things were very bad with MSD long before Covid.  Elderly people were writing in to politicans and the local newspapers saying that they were positioning security guards outside the Dunedin office to deny people entry to the Dunedin office in an attempt to deny service to people.  This was elderly people going in to see about pensions and the like.  They were employing security guards, instead, to turn them away.  They were also asking people to hand over their passports or other forms of identification.  Give those forms of identification to security guards positioned outside the office otherwise they wouldn't allow them entry to the office at all.  I wondered if maybe that would be what it was like trying to get to a NZ embassy from a third world foreign nation.  It would be like trying to hand in a completed research project with the university.  In a third world nation, like New Zealand.  THey aren't doing it to encourage people to apply for jobs and work rather than being dependent on welfare.  That's not the situation, at all.  THe sitution is that the government keeps people on welfare (less than minimum wage) in an expression of how little they value these people.  I mean to say, the government does not publically advertise employment opportunities.  Rather, they redeploy unqualified people into position (e.g., Ashley Bloomfield into the Univesrity when he does not have an MD or a PhD).  They are not publically advertising jobs that peeople they choose to keep on welfare would be qualified for.  THey are not processing applicatons for employment.  They throw away applications from people because they prefer to keep those people on welfare.  IF that means they keep the paid employment positions unfilled then that is what they will do.  They will not employ NZers to be doctors or nurses or teachers or anything, typically.  Because they prefer to keep the positions unfilled (else filled by temporary migrants who pay the goverment for visas and who then are reenrolled in training progrmmes apparently because we wont ackowledge their qualifications but we will give Ashley a job he isn't qualified for).  Because it is garbage land that makes absolutely no sense, at all.  But let's be clear:  THe people who are 'welfare dependent' are our government leaders.  Whose ideology is such that they are aiming to go to new lows only.  Keep as many people not employed as possible.</p>

                                <p>Let me tell you about the only employment opportunities that the government will consider for people.  They are of this sort or type or form.  THey will pay you, let's say, fourty dollars an hour (le's be generous) for 80 hours per week (let's be very generous).  But then they will reclaim all of it back int eh form of the parking you need to pay to be there.  You paying them for your uniform.  You paying to launder the uniform.  You paying for whatever training course they say you have to do else you will be out of a job etc.  They take all the money back from you so that you end up worse off than you would be on welfare.  So then they teach you, you see, that that's how little the government values you.  You are forced to welfare dependency if you know what is good for you.  That is what the government is offering you only and there is and are no alternatives.  Of course.</p>

                                <p>How about the private sector then?  Because NZ has a functioning private sector?  Does it?  Does it have start up companies?  Does it?  I see that they will allow people to position themselves so as to be declared bankrupt after not very much time at all.  They will even give you a little cash injection booster to set you up to be declared bankrupt.  But the goverment procurement contract process or procedure..  Well, it's like how they decide who to give the paid employment postitions to.  Who they decide to give the reseaerch funding to.  Corrupt, through and through, I mean to say.  They give everything to their children or their mates regardless of their competence or willingness to work tkhe job.  Often times they are only employed ot ensure it' snever done.  Most often it's simply about keeping as many others kicked back and down as possible.  Teachign as many others that their position on the social hirarchy in this nasty little despot is as low as low as low as they can go.  Get in behind the slow workers and do a dim approximation of the nothing they produce only.  Then maybe after a few decades of your sucking up and kicking down you can take their place!  Wow!  Then you will really have made it in life!  Thats how you know!  Ugh.  There's really nothing here...  Nasty little despot.  Not even a functioning judiciary.  Certainly not a health or education system.  </p>

                                <p>It doesn't matter who wins the election (which is just as well because they won't count the votes) because it makes little difference to who is in or who is out of parliament.  It's the same idiots either way.  I suppose they pay the party in political donations.  Like the Mexican guy who went to Mexico to pick up his fiance or hostage or whatever she was and bring her back to NZ to be with him during the first Covid lockdown when he was meant to be in parliament.  It doesn't matter what any of hte laws are anyway because the judiciary refuses to uphold them.  Una Jagose was too busy destroying evidence of the crimes of the government and reappointing judges out of retirement to help the judiciary cover up the crimes of the government to actually do the job for which she was paid.  There' snothing here. </p>

                                <p>So Ayesha is apparently firing people on political grounds.  She says that anybody against her is not politically neutral, as deemed by her to be.  She is not firing on the basis of whether they are competently doing their job or not (doing what their job description says they should do rather than them working only to prevent and prohibit it being done by anyone), but on the basis of political grounds.  Still, it's probably better for society that she's doing that rather than killing patients.  Right?  On personal or political grounds, of course.  Or maybe she's making political decisions on medical grounds?  Maybe she can declare anyone against her to be better kept in a psychiatric institution without a trial.  In fact, what would be better still is if the new health authority send them bills for their involuntary detention.  Like how the government wanted to ship arrivals directly to prison camp quarantine facilities and then send them the bill for their unlawful detention after the fact.  Then declare them to be criminals for not paying the government paying the government paying the government for holding them without trial?  Nobody voted for her..  She got in on the party list.  Was she affiliated with the party when she was employed as a politically neutral government civil servant in the health and education sector then, was she?  What a f*cking farce.  Just how much property does she have in Malaysia?   </p>

                                <p>The first case I brought before the courts was the case with the Tenancy Tribunal.  I paid the filing fee.  You aren't supposed to hire lawyers for the Tenancy Tribunal.  I did everything I was supposed to do.  I supplied the evidence to the courts.  The courts supplied a sensible judgment.  But then (I don't know why) the courts ordered that there be a re-hearing.  Maybe they wanted to double their case-load because they weren't busy enough?  I don't know why.  So there was a re-hearing.  The courts, again, supply a sensible judgment.  But then (I don't know why) the courts ordered that there be a third hearing (a second re-hearing).  Maybe because they wanted to triple their case-load because they still aren't busy enough?  I don't know why.  But this time the adjudicator decides he is going to gaslight.  He asserts that the landlord supplied evidence to the court that an electrician had hard wired the heater to the wall (in a way that was 'technically' (otherwise known as 'actually' prohibited by the manufacturers.  The installation booklet specifically stated in no less than three places not to wire it in the way that it had been wired in fact).  Where is the report from the electrician who signed off on that?  I was never provided one and I was supposed to be provided with all the evidence that had been supplied to the court.  I mean to say the adjudicator made false statement of fact.  But the courts workload was 3x that which it  needed to be.  They delay and delay and delay and..  Corruption.  So now there is a fourth hearing, this time at the District Court.  And the judge from there re-asserts that he has seen this electrical report when there is no such thing.  The only report that mentioned a heater being hardwire installed was from Prestige Building Compliance and they state specifically on their website and confirm in email to me that they are not electricians they are builders and they do not do hardwire of electrics.  So the courts of NZ decided to create 4x the workload for themselves in order to deliver 2 corrupt or incompetent judgments.  That was the decison that the courts of NZ made.  That was the tenancy tribunal and the district court.  But things are not any better with the high court, the court of appeal, or the supreme court, as my other filings show.  Not willing or able to do the justice, thing.  Australian federal court also won't process or progress filings.  Nothing here.  Nobody home. </p>

                                <p>New Zealand:  Crabs in a bucket.  Ensure they are kept as crabs in a bucket.  Each one of them only serving to drag the others back down.  Tall poppy syndrome.  Ensure that any who stand out from the herd are most swiftly culled from the herd.  Identify 'vulnerable targets' and seek to eliminate them early on.  Some of the highest rates of child abuse, bullying, suicide, 'suicide' (particularly in state care we deem it 'suicide' without a proper investigation into who is responsible for the wrongful death when so many people on payroll are not doing any of the things they are supposed to be doing.  Keeping people in buildings not fit for purpose (by design) paying people not trained or qualified (never would pay them otherwise) people who ensure their job is not filled by anyone (never would have selected them for the position otherwise).  There's nothing here.  Nobody home.</p>

                                <p>You want to help people?  You mean you are consenting to allow me to help myself to you?  We'd rather deploy people into position who have no other option.  To murder death kill our frienimies.  There isn't any such thing as a health system.  Look at the people they deploy into position for those roles.  Look at the *reasons* behind their decisions about who gets deployed into those positions.  Look at what it is that they value.  They want more and more people to continue on the good works of Dr Leeks.  Identifying targets and pimping the targets out.  Teaching boys to be girls to be slaves to be targets.  Set up for a lifetime of abuse and no employment.  Eliminate the competition.  It's sooooooo competitive.  All the f*cking animals gnawing each others arms off to be Gods.  </p>

                                <p>These are the decisoins of our soverign leaders of NZ, are they?  The only ones that international community will acknowledge?  Is that what they mean?  The leaders of NZ who never would have been deployed into that position, otherwise?</p>

                                <p>I will upload the Court of Appeal Registrars judgment that I am not bringing a matter of public interest before the courts.  That way other people won't take it personally when they see that the courts are simply copy and pasting filings irrespective of the details of the case.  The Registrars are not being sensitive to the details of the case, I mean to say.  They are simply on payroll to gaslight anybody who brings a case to the Court of Appeal into believing that there is something personally wrong with them that the Court of Appeal can't and or won't function. </p>

                                <p>
                                kim.com was declared to be bringing a matter of public interest before the courts, on the other hand, therefore security for costs was waived on public interest grounds.  In my case they just copy-paste assertions such as all my cases similarly being judged to be 'unwinnable' and 'hopeless' 'not a matter of public interest'  'entirely personal'.  The failure of the NZ judiciary to extradicte kim.com to stand trial in US courts is deemed to be a matter of public interest (public interest to keep him here filing and refiling and refiling with the courts so that the proceedings become bloated and convoluted and irrelevant things side-track the proceedings so he will never be extradited to stand trial.  NZ doesn't have laws to extradite  him, allegedly or apprently, and the Australian Federal Court refuses to uphold the laws of the Federal Government of Australia in the prison detention camp held without a trail or hearing of the substantive issue land that is the State of NZL.  kim.com doesn't stand trial of what he accused of in the US.  The NZ 'judiciary' says it's of public interest to keep him here tied up in all kinds of irrelevant filings and refilings to be held without trial of the substantive issue.  ) So the NZ courts will front the security for costs for keeping kim.com thereby diverted from having an actual trial whereas the failure of the Universities of NZ to enrol, progress through training, graduate from training, in accordance with their statutory function is not a matter of public interest at all, says the courts.  It is not a matter of public interest how medical doctors are selected for enrolment, whether graduate students are graduated once they've done the work for the qualification they applied to be enrolled in.  It's not even a matter of public interest if the 'universities' record that students are enrolled in qualifications they never applied to be enrolled in.  If they send their work out for the wrong qualification.  If they keep false enrolment records.  None of this is a matter of public interest, apparently.  By which they mean the person bringing these issues to the courts must pay the courts pay the courts pay the courts.   </p>

                                <p>What education and training system?  What judiciary?  What health system?  What ministry of social development?  Stanford Prison Experiment where you pick out a few to manage the many.  See how you can teach them to suck up and kick down else they will be kicked down.  I guess that's why Searle wrote about the constuction of social reality.  So they could set about the deconstruction of social reality.  Actually the dismantling of social reality.  The undermining of society.  Deploy people into position to not perform their statutory function (to take the money and the titles and not do their statutory function.  Pay them only to ensure their statutory function is not filled.  Not by them (the person on payroll to do it, the person publically acknowledged as the role-filler) and (by them having the titles and the money to ensure the role is not filled) not by anyone.  How can you identify who is employed with the primary function of research?  Why, the ones with no research output.  That must be all and only the ones on payroll the ones with the titles and honors to do research.  To ensure no research is ever done.  WHo is the person with the statutory function of upholding whistleblower complints?  Why the person who refuses to acknowledge that he has received a single one.  Nobody else will be paid to ensure that statutory function is never filled.  The statutory laws describe the fucntions that must be prevented and prohibnited from ever being filled to ensure the prevenetionand prohibnition of socieity.  The social engineering that goes into ensuring that NZ is the detention camp slave camp facility only.  The hierarchical chickens must be kept peck peck pecking at each other in their quest to be God such that there are no products of society or civilisation at all.  No cooperation.  The prevention and prohibition of cooperation.  Right Sterelny?  How is cooperation possible?  Seek it out!  Hunt it down!  Exterminate it!</p>

                                <p>California is, for the most part, not a very nice place to be.  They won't hire people to work at the Public Universities.  Well, only enough to live in the basements of the administration, of course.  Apparently Oxford etc is the same.  They won't pay people enough to live by the University.  You pay them you pay them you pay them you pay them to better help them identify 20 virgins to do anything anything anything for the various people on payroll there to do research, primarily.  Who don't actually have a research output.  Just stealing the work of the slaves and throwing them out of the university on 'personal grounds' when it is time to graduate them and pay them if you want them to keep working for you.  Or to shut up about your crimes.  Or something.  People are supposed to shut up, are they?  You don't pay me enough to shut up about your crimes.  Won't stop offending against me.  I'm a good target -- right?  The courts think I'm a great target.  Just put me on everybodies radar, right?  No justice certainly not for that one.  Get in there God-psychopaths!  There for the taking!  That's the aim the goal the purpose the point.  Clearly we don't have the capacity to raise everything to the ground because if we did it would have  been done, already.  Just chipping away at things from the sides.</p>

                                <p>There is no education system or judiciary in New Zealand.  We harbor kim.com so that he won't be prosecuted for his crimes in the US.  This is apparently a decision by our leaders for NZ to be a prison camp detention camp facility holding cell or environment.  How much money does kim.com pay the courts pay the courts pay the courts pay the courts of New Zealand?  Who does the cloud storage of the Judgments do you suppose?  The same people who do the security camera footage of the 'hospitals'?  How about keeping the medical records?  What medical records?  What court records?  What health system?  What judiciary?  There's nothign there.</p>


                                <p><a href="judicial-review/sc.pdf" target="_self">Roe v Auckland District Health Board [2021] NZSC 109</a>  This is supposed to be an output of the Supreme Court of New Zealand.  It shows that  New Zealand does not have a functioning Judiciary.  For example, I know what ultra vires, `wrongly decided' means.  The Supreme Court shows no understanding of that issue.  Insists on mischaracterising things only.  Apparently the Judges have authority to recharacterise the issue however they like.  In the service of injustice, of course.  The over-riding aim or consideration.  The propagation of injustice.  They can do anything anything anything they like.  Apparently they can simply choose to heap injustice most particularly on those who are not represented by lawyers.  When they are victims to crimes the government will not prosecute.

                                 They insist on continually asserting that I am whiney complaining because I don't like the decision that was made on entirely personal grounds.  They insist that that is the only complaint that I have and that complaint is not within their jurisdiction to hear because it is entirely personal.  They are correct that I am not bringing a class action suit but it isn't a matter of 'entirely personal therefore not public interest' on the one hand and 'class action suit from the countless individuals who have  been removed on 'entirely personal grounds' which is in fact ultra vires.  They refuse to judge the issue I brought before them (ultra vires decisions by people on payroll to have a statutory function).  They won't remove people from office who are unable and or unwillint to perform their statutory function.  Instead,   judges were re-hired back into position as judges out of their retirement in order to sign their signature on judgments from the NZ courts (e.g., High Court) so they can pretend to be too f*cking stupid to know what ultra vires means and judge whether or not an action that violates statute is ultra vires.  Justice Toogood can be on payroll as judge for the next 50 years until someone removes him from office the good old fashioned way?  Is that the ideal of it?  He was retired already.  What does he have to lose if he's removed from office instead of being prosecuted for his crimes?  Never stop paying never stop paying never stop paying for the crimes of the judges.  There's nothing here.  Too f*cking stupid?  Too f*cking corrupt.  Too f*cking corrupt.  Not competent.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  Not a functioning Judiciary in the State of New Zealand and the Australian Federal court pretends to be too f*cking stupid to parse the Australian Constitution that asserts NZ is a state of the Federation of Australia.  That means the federal court of australia has jurisdiction over the state of NZ.  But the Australian Federal court wont' process filings.  Won't hear cases.  There's nothing there.  Nobody home.  Too stupid?  Too corrupt?  Adminstration not workign, hey.   Nothing there. NZ is basically kept as new manus island.  No voting papers for people born in NZ.  No Australian passports.  No australian birth certificates or death certificates.  no australian wages.  No australian wages.  No education and training system.  Not processing the applications.  Not graduating all and only those working to internationally accepted standards of scholarship.  There's nothing there.  No fucntioning admnistration.  Nobody  home. </p>

                                 <p>Apparently the politicans are firing administrators now.  Not because they aren't doing the job for which they are paid.  But on entirely political or personal grounds.  Of course.  All decisions must be wrongly decided.  They must be decided on the basis of irrelevant information only where what is irrelevant is the reason for the decision and where what is relevant is deemed irrelevant by the decision maker.  That's how we make decisions in New Zealand.  That's how we don't have any actual decisions at all.  Only the wrongly decided is ever announced or pronounced to be the output of the urgency emergency pushed through under no consideration at quickly quickly quickly.  Why?  Because it never would have happened otherwise.  Because various people would not have the positions they currently occupy (in the univerities, the government, the hospitals, the schools) if they hadn't have been placed there on the basis of wrongly decided.  They know this.  Removal from office isn't enoguh because they never would have been holding that office if they hadn't have cheated and stolen and victimised everybody else.  Thrown however many applicatons away so that the job could just be handed to them as least competent on a silver f*ckign platter.  Babel-land.  All the hierarchical chicken God-wannabees kept squabblign and squawking cry cry cry cry crying for government assistance while the government redeploys the f*cking idiots into position to ensure the prevention and prohibition of development of New Zealand.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>It just does not matter at all what any of the laws are in Australasia because the Judiciary will not uphold them.  Can't do it.  Won't do it.  There's nothing here.  Nobody home.  That's why they tell the first years about the function of law.  So that they understand that various things in the world are not for us, not in Australasia.  Because Australasia is not even trying to be rule by law.  The judges will not uphold the law.  Pretend to be too stupid to identify the relevant legal issues (presented to them by applicants) and pretend to be too stupid to employ their basic reading comprehension of what the statutes say and apply that to actual cases.  Can't do it.  Won't do it.  There's nothing here.  Nobody home. Not even trying to be.</p>

                                <p>It's  been more than 4 months now for the Social Security Appeals Authority to write their judgment.  They are delaying writing up their judgment where what they are likely going to write up is that they do not  believe that justice is an essential need.  So they don't want or deserve a fair trail for their crimes, then?  Is that what they are going to assert in their judgment?  It's taken them more than 4 months, already.  They are saying it's a tribunal who writes the judgment.  But they have been on holiday and they have been off sick.  In the actual courtroom we had a Dutch (?) lawyer representing the Ministry of Social Development and the 'tribunal' was comprised of 2 individuals.  One of whom only had one thing to say.  He asked me if anybody supported me in any of this.  Then apologised for having asked a personal question.  That was his contribution to the legal proceedings. </p>

                                <p>When you find you have been deployed into position, say, as 'ICU nurse' only they aren't going to pay you the amount they are supposed to (if you don't like it then you pay the courts you pay the courts you pay the courts you never stop paying the courts for the crimes of the government) and they haven't trained you (you just did a 2 or a 10 week urgency emergency 'training progaramme' and you haven't done the basic health and saftey stuff and so on...  You should ask yourself..  Am I being paid to help (if I'm even being paid, in fact I am to pay them I am to pay them I am to pay them) or am I being paid..  No, I'm paying them I'm paying them I'm paying them.  To harm.  I mean..  Haven't done basic health and safety training.  Haven't trained for the position.  Just getting in there and having a go...  You think the army should be called in?  Why wouldn't you think you are not a mercenary taking out as many civilians as they can get you to..  Oh, because they don't pay you.  If they don't pay you then that means you aren't a mercenary..  NZ really aims and aspires to new lows..  Not even mercenaries because they won't pay them.  When did slaves have to pay the people who enslaved them?  New lows...</p>

                                <p>When you find yourself deployed into position as high or supreme court judge...</p>

                                <p>What do you do when the University of Auckland (any of the Australasian 'Universities' or any of the Australasian schools or any of the Australasian government departments doesn't pay you.  I know..  You should pay the courts pay teh courts pay the courts pay the courts pay the courts.  So they can pull judges out of retirement (because that's the process for appointing new judges) to declare that anything is within the law and you should pay the courts pay the courts pay the courts so the courts can delay and delay and delay and delay and delay...</p>

                                <p>Australasia does not have an education and training system.  I don't know who decided that.  If it was purely descriptive (it does not have one) or if it was prescriptive as well (it will not develop or have one or work towards the development or having of one).  I don't know if the ideology was that people struck off for atrocities overseas would arrive here all voluntary-like only to find themselves in a prison slave or detention camp on arrival...   If the ideology was that Australasia would be the world's prison or detention camp a place to ship the convicts who were too costly to punish, just ship the degenerates off to Australasia.  Or if the ideology is that nowhere in the world actually has an education and training system and it's just open warfare with them trading the degenerates around.  Intentionally hiring only those who plagarised or cheated or whatever.  Putting them to 'work' targeting people as vulnerable people and eliminating them etc.  So, England or Australia or whatever choosing to at least pretend to employ and acknowledge skills and qualifications of offenders from Australasia.  Dr Leeks exported to Australia as 'must have' or 'only game allowed in this town' or similar.</p>

                                <p>Sterelny seems determined to tell the world that everything has been overtaken by psychopaths and there isn't any co-operation at all.  Only temporary coordination between frienemies while you look to how to elmiinate the competition at the first available opportunity.  That's the world that he sees.  That's the world he contributed towards the development of?  That's his legacy?  Everything he wanted the world to be?  Or he just got stuck on the way the world is.  He committed to it being the way the world must be?  All the research funding for him.  While he refuses to do the supervision and training job for which he is paid.  I suppose they would not pay him otherwise.  Think about what you have to do to get paid to be a medical doctor, then.  Or a laywer.  There isn't an education and training system.  There isnt' a health system.  There isn't a judiciary.  Not really any people.  Not behaviorally modern.  Crabs in a bucket.  Cattle to the slaughter.  What products of civilisation?  What arts and culture?  What science and technology?  Stuck at slavery.  Might is right.  Only game in town.  It's soooooooooo competitive.  Everyone is on a hierarchy of who can force who to do what.  On who takes most of the money out.  Patting each other on the backs about how clever they are.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>The only sorts of things they will fund seem to be ones involving torture or whatever.  The people on payroll seem to encourage them.  So they can go 'see see see I can't in good conscience sign this one off' else they think they can allow them to be signed off by externals because nobody will hire them for the atrocities they have documented they did in the name of their PhD research.  Else the...  Uh..  Uselessness of it.  I mean to say put the students to work designing yet another crapp (cr(appy) app(lication).  Usually an app that measures some physiological parameter not very well.  Not quite nip alert.  Barely.  Must have.</p>


                                <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/131353866/new-zealands-health-system-is-keeping-something-important-private  I recall one of the first year populuation health lecturers joking(?) about how private 'healthcare' might get you better food or fluffy towels, but it is the same people working or 'working' across both sectors.  So it doesn't buy you competent or well intentioned health professionals since it's the same people hand-picked for the very same qualities that were valued.  In fact, I'm wondering whether the Christchurch private surgical hospital is even more likely to be staffed or stocked by incompetent frauds who are generally malicious than the public hospital down there is.  Of course there is an aspect or elemenet of the people in charge or control of the private wanting to undermine the public.  Hold hostages so people kickstart or gofundme else the patient dies.  Take a drive by past the private psychiatric facility in Dunedin.  Just past Waikari.  Does it look like it is a functioning private in patient psychiatric unit to you?  Or..  Nobody home.  What psychiatry?   </p>

                                <p>Where does the private sector get their blood units from?  Their organs?  Is organ transplant surgery public or private (user pays) in NZ?  How do they decide who gets prioritised for the public funded operations?  Who does the sterile supply technician work in private hospitals, anyway?  I applied for work as a sterile supply technician (entry level job) with the Auckland DHB on at least 2 occasions and they refused to hire me just re-advertised the same position.  Apparently they set up a Degree programme for it, now, so that a studnet can pay the University for three or was it six or was it twenty years so they can pay and pay and pay and pay the NZ university system to be put to internship volunteer work to pick bits of hair or bone off the surgical equipment when it comes out the autoclave.  Who does that work in the private hospitals?  Where do they get their medical supplies?  Their surgical anasthetics?  </p>

                                <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/479603/auckland-university-unionised-staff-to-keep-refusing-to-enter-student-grades  So any studnet who was enrolled in a 120 point 1 year research qualification for the 2022 academic year who did not have their grade (after a period of external examination) entered into the system before 22 November 2022 -- is not going to have any grade entered into the system.  They are just supposed to, uh, wait for the people who take their work to get paid more.  The pickets were the research output of the tenured research academics for the 2022 academic year, where they?  Posters.  Sort of...  I like the one on the far left.  What do you think?  The author of that one worth 100,000 per year (relatively speaking)?  Who else is going to teach the studnets to output only dimmer approximations of that for less pay?  When the New Zealand Medical Students Journal is publishing work from Philosophy Professors then where are the New Zealand Medical Students supposed to publish their work, then?  Let me guess, they are supposed to present their research work article on a poster-board for conference so visiting academics can take a picture of it then after they have been failed out of the university (or not had their grades uploaded) the visiting academics can pass the work off as their own.  Put the actual article behind a paywall possibly write a new abstract for it in their own words (or get their studnets summarising it for them or get a computer programme to generate an abstract for the article by putting a few key words into grammatically correct autocomplete)...  There's nothing there...</p>

                                <p>How will they pick the MBChB students when the studnets haven't had any grades entered?  What students?  How do they pick the hostages for next year.  Check your student loan, people.  The University of Waikato invoiced the IRD for courses of study I never even applied to.  See what programme of study the university deployed you into, now...</p>

                                <p>https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2023/03/bogus-kiwi-psychiatrist-zholia-alemi-who-forged-auckland-university-degree-jailed-for-seven-years.html How long do you think it will be before she is proclaimed to have died in prison and she's shipped to New Zealand or Australia?  Peter Crampton would likely think she was a 'must have' for...  Neurosugery?  Orthopedics?  Dunedin needs 2 Neurosugeons to make up 3.  There we go:  Must have.  I'm sure she will fit in with the only guy who they will employ to do (pretend to do) that, now. </p>

                                <p>So...  We are supposed to believe that the Royal College of Psychiatry in England accepted her forged Degree Certificate and did not request detailed transcripts or references from people who had supervised her on her clinical skills?  Or, are we supposed to believe that she forged all of that detailed transcripts and references, too?  I would think that the most likely situation or scenario was that she was accepted into a Specialist Psychiatry Training Programme in England not despite or in spite of her having forged a Degree Certificate.  So they knew that she forged it (that that was why there were no transcripts) and she either had no references or was deemed a 'most psychopathic therefore must have' candidate for Psychiatry.</p>

                                <p>So, after being accepted to train as a Psychiatrist in England (allegedly on the basis of a forged Degree Certificate) she went through her supervised training and she was declared competent to work unsupervised as a specialist psychiatrist.  And she proceeded,then, to do that over the next however many years.  Apparently despite or in spite of her having forged her Degree Certificate.  And not at all only because she forged her Degree Certificate.  Yeah, right.</p>

                                <p> I guess it is difficult finding the right personality to work the death camps.  I mean to say, who works or 'works' in places committing atrocities?  Against civilians?  In peace time (supposedly).  The government institutions for the people who allegedly or apparently or supposedly actually voted that government in...  It doesn't really make any sense at all, does it.  Anyway, I'm sure she'll be 'must have' for the glue factory.  Middlemore.  Better get busy fast-tracking her visa...  How many medical or psyschitry students do you think she bullied into fleeing?  Such that she could be the only game in town?  We won't bother training or graduating a workforce.  We'll just collect up all the 'must have' psychopaths from around the world.  Be involved in this process of trading and shipping them around.</p>

                                <p>I actually do wonder if they know that anybody claimimg to have PhD or have graduated from Medical and maybe also Law School in New Zealand...  Australia.  Maybe even England...  I do wonder if they know that anybody who claims to have one of these qualificiations, anybody who supplies transcripts attesting to that, anybody who supplies references attesting to their suitability for paid employment...  THey know that these people are wrongful deathbringing pedophile psychopaths.  Because they won't say that any other people have graduated in fact.  I mean to say...  If someone supplies papers to show they are PhD or MBChB graduate then you know they are a phoney fraud because they are not supplying any PhD or MBChB transcripts or papers or references anymore.  So, just claiming to have one means that you are a fraud or a hoax.  If that it precely that those qualifications signify or mean.  Because the people who have done the work for them...  They won't supply them with the qualifications or the references etc.</p>

                                <p>I mean you can see for yourself on the writing pages the work that I did for the ANU while Sterelny was on the books as my Supervisor.  While he was paid to supervise me.  But he will not supply me with a reference at all for any of the work that I did while he was paid to supervise me.  He likely will pretend not to know that I've even done any of it.  He won't acknowledge any of the work that I did while he was paid to supervise me.  How much money was he paid, again?  How much money is he paid now?  So he can pretend to  be Duuuuh too stupid.  Go off on another family holiday, then?  Are you going to ask me to house-sit for you while you go off on holiday, again?  For how many years are your students expected to do your household chores for you for?  Go away on camping trips ffs.  So you can refuse to acknowledge their work and refuse to write them references and refuse to get their work to externals.  What a f*cking joke.  And what is your attitude to this now?  What is the Universities?  Haha you lose.  Great.  Let's be properly honest about the situation then so that prospective students know what kind of game they are playing when they arrive to Australia to study with the ANU and with people like you.</p>

                                <p>The Ombudsman wrote, at some point, that Grafton keeps the most secure ward as something very separate or different from the rest of the hospital.  Does not treat it or think of it as a hospital very obviously.  I mean to say, there is not integration with pathology (urine tests for what drugs the patients are testing positive for while they are being unlawfully detained against their will in the most secure wards with no visitors also pregnancy tests).  The food contract is also different from the food that is supplied to patients in the rest of the hospital.  The Ombudsman has documented their unlawful use of seclusion (where they remove witnesses from how they are treating the people who are being unlawfully detained there) and so on...  The newspapers said something about a girl who wanted to study Medicine at Auckland who was apparently raped in her residential hall, detained in that part of the hospital, then her visa was removed because she violated visa conditions by being hospitalised so they deported her without her degrees.  I wonder who allegedly raped her.  The son of whom, I mean to say?  So we understand the function of whatever this is that they call psychiatry.  So the people can understand how and why NZ does not have psychiatry, at all.  No such thing in these lands.  The people currently and presently involved in it don't seem willing or able for there to be psychiatry.  They are not voluntarily changing from within to be psychiatry.  Rather they seem more interested to self-destruct the entire enterprise.  Or does the Royal College of Psychiatry for England want to stand up and say 'no, we didn't train her or graduate her she was a fraud'?  What does Australasian Psychiatry want to say about Dr Leeks?  Oh...  He was redeployed so he could continue on his crimes and then we claim he died in state care (yeah right) so he wouldn't need to stand trial for his crimes.  Where is he now?  Did he go to England to continue on as Psychiatrist?  Maybe selecting which of the studnets he thought had the most willingness and ability to cover up for and continue on with his crimes?</p>

                                <p>I wonder how many people are, like, 'I never really thought about Medicine as a career but then I saw the statue of the guy taking a big piss over the domain and I felt so very motivated and inspired to be that guy'?  How many, do you think?  Then the ideology is 'if you don't like it and you don't feel motivated and inspired by it then f*ck off, then'.  Right.  So you can get back to wrongful deathbrining and so on.  Taking advantage of vulnerable people.  Taking advantage of people when they are their most vulnerable.  So the governments of the world can traffick you around as a 'must have' for herd or population mangement or control.  Redeploy you to shut the masses up.  Beat them into submission.  Eliminate them entirely.</p>

                                <p>How long must disabled people wait?  Why, until they are no longer with us, of course.  Other people get paid by the hour, week, month, year to keep the disabled people disabled.  Kicked back and down.  Not listened to.  NOt heard.  It's not about disabiltiy at all it's all very very very particular and very very very very personal.  There's nothing wrong with going after particular individuals on personal grounds, says the courts.  Scapegoating an individual or scapegoating the lonesome stranger is the whole point and purpose.  To target people as vulnerable and remove them.  But it isn't about disability.  It's just always abotu something...  Too old, too young, too tall, too short, don't like your hair cut, don't like your face.  Too smart, too stupid.  Too thin too thick.  Too much.  Not enough.  It doesn't really  matter why.  The garbage garbelled nonsene that falls out of their faces purporting to be an excuse.  Bullies might is right and they are getting away with it.  It's as simple as that.  They get paid by the hour, day, week, month, year, to delay and hold up and...  Be too sick to do their work in a timely fashion.  Be off on family holiday.  While they get paid to delay and obstruct and prevent and prohibit and confuse and hold up.  That's how it's easy enough for the government to deploy and redeploy them to seemingly very different positions or posts.  The reality of the job is all samey samey, however.  Delay and prevent and prohibit and obstruct and confuse and deny...  It doesn't matter whether it's education or health or justice or anyting anything anyting at all.  Get someone good at being all 'awwwwwww we are soooooo tryyyyyyyyyying' while not doing any of the things that are supposed to be done (reading their statutory responsibility and ensuring that it is not upheld by anyone).  Allllllllll of the payroll for them.  ANd their in-bred sons...</p>

                                <p>We know that there are competent lawyers becuase those are the ones the government chooses to payroll to defend the government's crimes.  The government chooses to hire major firms and queens counsels to assert the governments rights to choose anybody they like on entirely personal grounds to be enrolled in medicine or law or even programmes like an MPhil when there is only one applicant who has actually met requirements but the university allegedly or apparently doesn't have a single person on payroll willing or able to supervise the student for the programme of study listed in the calendar...  Nobody on payroll is available to supervise a research program in philosophy.  No philosophy research.  Not really a university, hey.  The prevention and prohibitnion of research institution.  Collecting a bunch of money up for the keeping of slaves.  To take their research outputs and give them away (Caroline Mason still has my 04 October Masters theiss submission. She says that she did not return it to the University.  The University Calendar Reguatlions say that that means she wanted the substantive changes done within 10 weeks.  I did those changes and the University refused to get tehm back to her.  I informed her of that fact and she...  Tells me not to email her.  Must have for ethics.  I'm sure she probably got promoted to head of the ethics committee or board, now.  I think they are trying ot have the formal laws changed to be explicit that they are allowed to do experiments on people who don't have the capacity to consent.  So they can get busy exterminating anybody they allege has dementia or alzheimers or parkinsons in the name of medical research.  How will they find the LD 50 on the euthanasia drugs for people?  Who will run the randomised double blind control trials on the human subjects?  How are you going to select scientists and medical doctors to be deployed into those positions?</p>


                                <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/484977/understaffed-whangarei-nurses-requested-army-support-at-flu-season-s-peak  Hmm. Well, we were informed that a nurse got 6x the dose of Fentanyl from the supply room all by herself and then killed a patient with it.  So, that should be sufficient to incentivise and motivate quite a few people to apply for employment as a nurse.  Whether you pay them or not.  Something something about virtue being it's own reward.  I don't know why I was thinking that there would actually be engineering diagrams of the hospital facilities.  Why would we think them capable of keeping accurate records of that when they don't appear willing and or able to keep accurate records of anything else.  I was suprised to learn that the Grafton Hospital doesn't seem to have a pharmacy dispensary, either.  There isn't a pharmacist taking responsibility for the medications that are given to nurses or doctors to be given to patients (presumably) in turn.  But then something something about gang members (allegedly or apparently) simply walking into store rooms and walking off with medical supplies.  Of course that is what they would say when the stock inventory doesn't match up with all the money the administration and managment said they spent on stock procurement.</p>

                                <p>I'm thinking about the son of the surgeon at the voluntary 'hospital' in Christchurch.  Where does it it procure it's medical supplies from?  A few people take them from the public hospital and relocate them to the private  hospital.  Is that right?  Where do they get their blood units from?  Were do they get their surgical anasthetics?  Do they purchase them from the drugs companies on the private market or are they taking them from the government supplies?  They are regulated substances.  Supposed to be.  Who is responsible for ensuring they are used responsibly?  And not for the purposes of date raping patients etc etc?  How about the credentials of the people allegedly or supposedly volunteering to be surgeons?  WHo is responsible when they leave surgical mesh or whatever whatever whatever inside patients in the hope that they'll develop sepsis and die weeks to months later all unrelatedly-like?  Who is responsible?  How much in the way of medical supplises did his son take into the Ukraine?  Drugs as well?  Surgical anasthetics?  Was he working in the Ukraine prison camps for Russian soldiers or something else?  Is that what is training in Christchurch prepared him for?  Or was he working in the Ukraine orphanages or obgyn wards?  Apprently he's disappeared.  I guess that means he won't be accountable for his crimes, then.  Must have.  Is that what he needed to do to be declared 'graduated' from his medical training?</p>

                                <p>Are we more corrupt than South Africa?  It is a serious question...  I'm not asking about the perception of those who may as well have their eyes poked out.  Just because you are too corrupt to employ competent prosecutors does not eliminate corruption...  Quite the converse...</p>

                                <p>We know about air-tags now, right?  But we've been microchipping peoples pets for quite some time so that's nothing new.  Come on...  They were tracking the HIV medication so they could see where it went.  What was preventing the donated medical supplies from getting to the sick kids in Africa, say, and seeing them being sold to the highest bidders in the black market.  They could see what was happening with the Covid vaccines and various of the other drugs. </p>

                                <p>Say you purchase 100 units of something.  It expires in 1 year.  Let's say that only 20 units per year are typically used.  So you witness 80 units per year, roughly, being thrown away at the end of it's life.  You think 'what a waste, there must be money in them hills' so...  So you start purchasing less.  40 units, say.  Then you need to get stingy on who gets the units.  Why stop there?  20 units.  Hey.  No units.  Pocked the money that was supposed to be spent on procureing units and claim to have thrown them away when they were past use by.  Else, pretend to be too stupid to do stock rotation and just leave old stock there.  Get new stock in (at cheap rates for crying about being part of the third world) and then sell it back only just undercutting local prices in teh USA or wherever.  Corruption.  There's little to no accountability in Medical Administration, right Peter Crampton?  Tell the kiddies that so they understand that the money (and little to no accountabiltiy) is in that job.  That that is why we don't have medical doctors.  Because the adminiration is not being held to account for choises they are making for their own personal gain.  Corruption.  Don't you want to join them?  Party party.  Let's have a party.</p>

                                <p>The politicians are not the biggest problem, I would say, when it comes to the government hemorrhaging money on people who simply are not worth that much (relatively speaking). It's the half a million dollars for him and three quarters of a million dollars for him civil servants with the ministries and the external contractors whose social status position must be preserved at all costs that seem to be the major problem.  How much does Ashley Bloomfield get these days?  Una Jagose?  Justice Toogood?  Chris Whelan?  The Vice Chancellors of NZ Universities who aren't willing and or able to process enrolments or keep accurate student records.  Etc.</p>

                                <p>The Ministry of Social Development decided that 'justice is not an essential need'.  The courts gave them extension after extension on their filings.  Finally a hearing was scheduled.  More than 4 months after the hearing the Social Security Tribunal still has not delivered a judgment.  Justice delayed is justice denied.  There doesn't appear to be a justice system in New Zealand.  THe judiciary fails to function.  Nobody home.  </p>

                                <p>The people who decide that justice is not an essential need...  Why aren't they the ones, then, forced to go without it?  If they don't think it is important, they don't need to have it for themselves.  Why do they get their day in court?  That doesn't make any sense...  They gave up that right when they said it wasn't needed for others.  This country makes no sense at all.</p>

                                <p>I used to try to respect their work.  I didn't want for Justine or Rachel or Holly or Ben or Brett or Kim or John or any of them to be out of a job.  To not have their research heard and respected.  But they did not extend that same courtesy to me.  So now I speak out against them.  Because they chose to not extend that same courtesy to me.  They think I'm some kind of fan-boy who is expected to hand over my work so they can steal it or not get it externally examined so as to prevent and prohibit my applying for research funding and the like.  They think they win because they throw my application away.  Sterelny thinks he's a winner because he refuses to write me a reference for the work I did while he was named as my supervisor.  While he was paid to be.  I did everything he asked of me.  Where is  his evidence that I did not?  F*cking psychopath.  Is what he chooses to be. </p>

                                <p>I mean, I guess things moved or shifted.  When I was an undergrad the first years were reading Plato and Descartes (in translation).  You wanted to see evidence of them having done the primary readings.  Then, at some point, they decide that the students are too stupid to read Plato and Descartes (in translation) so you replace them with a textbook by Eliot Sober.  Then you decide that the students are too stupid to read Eliot Sober.  So you don't expect them to actually read any textbook at all.  They can read your powerpoint presentation bullet points.  Then you decide to fail out of the University any students with the capacity to read Plato and Socrates because we can do anything anything anything we like.  I wasn't sure how much the grades assigned by tutors (typically first years are graded by second years, now, second years are graded by third years.  Third years are only just given enough grades for Honors.  Maybe.  Or maybe they get more money holding them as third years for extra time...  Whatever is most financially lucrative for the greedy grubs in the University.  The aim, really, is to put the kids into groups and the slave-kids can do all the work for all the other kids.  The manager elites can hand in the slave-kids work and pass that off as their own.  It doesn't really matter what the tutors or whomever grade the students, anyway, because the University administration simply changes the grades to whatever it likes.  Even if they did keep them accurately in the student records.  But I don't know why they would or could do any such thing.  I mean, they don't seem willing or at all able to actually keep accurate student records.  They aren't keeping accurate records of enrolment dates, particularly.  They aren't getting studnets work out to externals for exernal examination and they aren't basing the outcome of examination on the reports of external examiners, at all.  Not universities, hey.  Not even trying to be.  Slave, hostage, detention camp facilities is all.</p>

                                <p>It is just great, isn't it.  How they choose the extremely knowledgeable and intelligent and motivated individuals to be doctors, lawyers, engineers.  To be employed into government positions with various ministries. To write reports advising the government on various things.  To get research fundign and the like.  How they select who to give all the money to.  I guess that's how Australasia gets to be a real social and development and science and tech and arts etc etc etc leader on the world stage.  It got as far as slavery, right Sterelny?  Then everything ground to a halt.</p>

                                <p>The Junior doctor who killed that teenager after she was going to tell people about him drugging her and her friends (with hospital supplies) and having sex with her after she'd been drugged etc...  I'm trying to remember if he was deployed into his position in Dunedin before or after Peter Crampton was deployed into his position with the DHB to throw away applications from people who wanted to work there until people like that particular Junior doctor was the...  Only person for the position.  Only game in town.</p>

                                <p>Apparently that junior doctor died in state care.  He died in prison, apparently.  I don't know why we would believe that.  Was there an open casket funeral so that the parents of the teenager he murdered could see that he was dead?  I think it more likely that he was redeployed to some other hospital.  He would be a 'must have' I would imagine or suppose because he would keep quiet about other people stealing date rape drugs from the hospital with the intention of feeding them to teenagers (as he was known for) and so on.  I wonder if he would be willing to work for next to no wages in exchange for hosting parties that could be attended by various other people...  Maybe judges?  I"m trying to get a handle on the level or extent of the corruption, here.</p>

                                <p>Alister Gunn all up and died when it was time to properly investigate the messages he was leaving on the phone of high school girls.  Apparently.  And apparently Dr Leeks up and died when it was time for him to answer for what he was up to with various people in state care.  But before they investigated Dr Leeks at all they moved him around in an attempt to further facilitate his crimes.  They knew that the public were not accepting of this kind of behavior so they move the offenders around.  They seem to preferentially hire known offenders.  Them being offenders actually seems to be something of a prerequisite on their applications for various positions being something that is considered, at all. I don't even know if they need to apply for the postions or if they are actually  head hunted once their status as an offender is known.</p>

                                <p>Apparently it isn't that England is making Australasia be the world' detention or prison camp for pedophiles and the like..  Apparently teh situation is that our soverign leaders choose to lead in this manner or way.  They voluntarily choose to select candidates not on the basis of objective published selection criterion but on the basis of entirely personal reasons or personal grounds.  And look at what they seem to personally choose to select for.  </p>

                                <p>Various people who are skilled and knowledgeable and not pedophiles have their skills and knowledge dismissed and disregarded and ignored.  So that htey can preferentially hire offenders and people who will not speak out about the offenders being deployed into position.  </p>

                                <p>Nothing here,  hey.  </p>

                                <p>The Social Security Tribunal has succeeded in delaying proceedings for 1 year.  So there can be another intake of wrongly decided medical students.  So that Professor Ashley Bloomfield MBChB MPubHeal PhD MD  can have his 40 virgins picked out for all the reasons he values, no doubt.  They will be required to do anything anytihng anyting anything he says and he will get to decide when and whether they have done enoguhf or a 120 point Masters Degree in the next decade or two or three of their life.   No doubt.  Not even pretending to be the developed world.  Did you actually apply for your positon, ashley, or did they just offer it to you?  No application was needed for them to redeploy you to be Professor, now.  How many hundreds of thousands per year do they pay you not to do any research at all?  What a winner.  What a winner at life.  You should talk to all the hurricane victims about what it means for them to be a victim.  A loser.  THey seem to feel entitled to something different or better.. . I don't know where they get these strange ideas... </p>

                                <p>----</p>

                                <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/300813306/how-a-forged-auckland-uni-degree-hoodwinked-the-uks-general-medical-council  This is not plausible.  To be a psychiatrist you don't fool the general medical counsil.  You fool the royal british college of psychiatry.  To be a specialist psychiatrist.  Who signed off on completion of her psychiatary training?  If she arrived in the UK claiming to be a medical graduate of NZ then she would have needed to have been accepted to a specialist psychiatry training position and then complete that training to their satisfaction before they would payroll her as psychiatrist.  Remember the UK medical graduate that NZ royal australasian college of neurosurgery trained for however many years (saying they refused to acknowledge that he had completed neurosurgical training with the royal college in England) who they refused to employ in the Dunedin hospital?  Remember him?  New Zealadn refused to acknowledge that he had trained enough in NZ to be completed from his neurosurgery degree training.  So they threw out his application to be a neurosurgeon in Dunedin because they refused to acknowledge his neurosurgery qualification.  Remember that?  Last I heard he had big plans to pay the courts and pay the courts and pay the courts and pay the courts and pay teh courts and pay the courts because New Zealand was refusing to acknoweldge that he'd completed his Royal Australasian College of Neurosurgery training.  
                                </p>

                                <p>I am trying to remember if Peter Crampton had been re-deployed into the Otago DHB before the above guys application to be a neurosurgeon had been thrown away by the DHB.  They said the position was going to be unfilled  because they didn't have anybod qualified apply to fill the position.  Before that they told the old people that the position was not filled because there wasn't enough money to hire anybody to do it.  So the old people got out their cheque books and they did a fundraiser so then the funds were there.  So they hired Dirk De Ridder to be Neurosurgeon Professor at the University.  He gave a  bunch of public lectures saying how he sees Renaissance Paintings in the Neuroanatomy (presumably because he doesn't actually know his neuroanatomy very well at all).  But the only person on payroll to work as a Clinical Neurosurgeon in the Dunedin hospital...  Well, I can tell you right now that 99% certain, I am, that if you look into him you will find that he is some kind of hoax or fraud.  That he doesn't have an undergrad degree.  Else he doesn't have specialist training in neurosurgery.  You can bet that he's on payroll because he keeps his yap shut about atrocities is the only reason why he's on payroll.  Because he will bully the students into fleeing.  That's why he's on payroll.</p>

                                <p>I would similarly say that I'm about 99 per cent certain that the Psychiatry Professor hire for Auckland is a fraud or hoax or some kind as well.  Else if you look into him you will find that he was a demonstrated and known problem for sex offenses or similar before they chose to hire him.  I would lsay that was a precondition or prerequisite on deploying him into his postion as head of psychiatry in the Grafton hospital in charge of signing off (or not) on Auckland Medcial Students.  He apparently trained in spain or portugal or similar as Obgyn.  So cervical exams and removal of foetus.  THen he's apparently doing a PhD with Professor Glue at Otago.  In something neuro.  Then he's redeployed to be Professor at Auckland.  Where tehy are not keeping accurate medical records.  Where tehy are having medical studnets doing unsupervised physical exams on people who have been sectioned under the mental health act (who are not in the position to consent) in teh most secure wards of the Grafton hospital.</p>

                                <p>I am thinking about how the Waikato Times has reported, ovr the years, at least 2 individuals as psychiatrists who turn out to be later acknowledged by them as not being graduates of any MBChB programme and also not being graduates of any specialist psychiatry training programme. The thing is that that is very specifically and preicsely the only reason why they deployed them into those positions.  Many others (all the others?) are likely frauds or hoaxes or fakes as well.  They particularly like to get ESL psychiatrists who can claim to be 'culturally different' and not competent in English.  So people put their stupidity and or ignorance down to that.  It would be impolite to suggest anything else.  Why?  I guess because they underpay tehm.  Maybe because the people they claim to be on payroll actually pay them to pass themselves off as medical doctors.  So the DHB can simply launder the money out.  Like what the Universities do with teh student scholarships.  The moeny doesnt' go to the students you see.  If you have a problem with it then pay the courts pay teh courts pay the courts pay the courts.  If you have a complaint then various Justices don't want to be in retirement.  I suppose they get some kind of payroll for signing their name to various judgements making false assertions and so on.  Never stop paying the courts.  Never stop paying the courts.  Never stop paying for the crimes of the various people deployed into positions of power in NZ.  Never stop paying for their crimes.  Apparently these are the soverign decisions of the leaderse of NZ.  To run or rule the 'country' as a prison camp or detention camp off of Australia where teh NZ born nationals are kept deteained as hostages or slaves to teh foreigners they deploy into position.  And the particuilarly stupid or incomptent chidlren of the adminsitration.  The only ones whose applications they didn't simplyi throw away etc.</p>

                                <p>Supply the building plans to the UN inspectors so they know about the undergradound accessways and tunnels and rooms under the ground.  Give them unrestricted access to the Grafton hospital.  Sorry, 'hospital'.  Get them checking the qualifications and so on of the only people they will put on payroll.  They hire the likes of Peter Crampton to throw away applications from people who are actually qualified and the like.  It's just a scummy hoax of a scummy scam is what it is.  They aren't even trying to do things properly at all.  All they are doing is redeploying people into poistion to cover up more and more and more and more of their ongoing crimes.  </p>

                                <p>The response to the whole inquiry into state care from the courts has been... To order more and more and more children to be wards of the state.  To order more and more chidlren to be given to people employed as medical doctors in our hospitals.  Quicklky quicklky before any medical doctors from overseas can testify that maybe what the people on payroll in NZ want to do with them is not actually in the patients interest.  QUicklky quickly quickly the medical atrocities.  They aren't even trying.  Thow the applications away.  Throw the applications away.  They won't acknowledge anybody who doesn' want to commiit medical atrocites.  Only those willing to commit atrocities and cover up their crimes need apply.  All and only those who are unqualified.  It's a f*cking scummy hoax of a f*cking scummy scam.  Only the children of the administration need apply.  They likely don't even need to apply to be simply deployed into position.  They aren't even trying to be fair at all.  There's nothing here.</p>

 

                                <p>I guess the thing with the Univerisities is that most of the employees have been very very very unhappy there for quite some time.  Because they know they are on a sinking ship and they'll be replaced by an AI script or whatever in the very near future.  All the things they were happy to see happening to their students (them being bullied away) will happen to them.  Of course.  They just brought themselves more time by throwing their students under the bus first.</p>

                                <p>See, the Universities will just fire the lot of them.  The only reason they deployed them into their positions was because they were unwilling and or unable to actually do any research.  The only reason they deployed them into their positions was because they had documented their plagarism and the like.  Those were preconditions of them being on payroll at all. So it's simple enough, then, to simply expose them for the frauds and hoaxes and scummy scams that they are and if they get upset about not being on payroll and about having their qualifications taken back or not acknkowledged anymore then they can pay the courts they can pay teh courts they can pay the courts they can pay ateh courts.  Whiile the courts refuse to accept their filings and mischaracterise and misrepresent their filings and refuse to schedule hearings and refuse to deliver judgments.  let them pay the courts pay teh courts pay the courts pay the courts.  So the courts can deploy people unwillling and or unable to find in the interests of justice.  They can employ only people unwilling and or unable to parse the laws.  They can deploy tehm into position.</p>

                                <p>Does this sound like what hapens during times of peace?  Better weather bomb them into submission then.  Have them cry cry cray cry cry cry crying for governmetn handouts.  Have them with their hands out cry cray vry cry cry ing for supplication.  It's a f*cking miracle that there is anything at all.  Right Sterelny?  Just hand over all of your stuff.  How old are you now, Sterelny?  Done any research work lately?  Alll of the money for you then.  Must have.  Only game in town.</p>

                                <p>I guess Japan was placed under special administration of the USA.  Hong Kong was placed under special administration of England.  Taiwan was China.  New Zealand was granted soverignty despite the law.  Else, Australia was given permission to pretend not to be responsible for the State of New Zealand.  It is in the Australian Constitution that NZ is a State of Australia.  But Australia treats NZers as second class citizens.  Refuses to supply Australian Passports and Birth Certificates.  Refuses to supply Federal Election Voting Papers.  Refuses to process applicatons for enrolment and graduation.  Refuses to process applicatons for employement.  From people born in the State of NZ.  Refuses to pay Australian wages.  Gets New Zealand Dollars printed in Canada to help disguise how poorly NZers are kept.  Will not pay the workers.  Treats NZ as new manus island slave detention camp.  The other nations seem to condone this.  They allow NZ embassies on their soil.  They supply diplomats to NZ.  They meet with the leader of NZ as the leader of a Country rather than of a State.  They grant NZ a seat at the UN (when it is only a State) while NZ says it opposes Taiwan having a Seat  because it says Taiwan is only a State.  It's a f*cking sh*t show of a f*cking garbage land.  Who is responsible?  I don't think that it is the soverign decisions of New Zealanders to be the f*cking garbage land of the world.</p>

                                <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/131312737/i-cheated-on-a-university-essay-using-chatgpt  So this is what you have to do to pass.  I can tell you what you have to do to fail.  First year Population or Public Health with the University of Auckland.  Compulsory paper for students doing the 'Health Science Pathway' to Medicine.  This is a course they recoomend for 'language rich' students with a solid background in courses like English, Philosophy, and Law.  By way of context I have a BA, BA(Hons), MA, in Philsophy.  Nothing less than an A- for various first and second year courses in English Literature.  I even have a first in class for Law and Society from the Univerity of Auckland.  I attend every single lecture for Population or Public Health. Every single one. I do every single reading.  All of the readings.  I attend all the tutorials.  I seriously and honestly engage in writing the essays.  I spend probably more time on the essays than I should given the rest of my course or work load.  I spend an entire weekend on the first one.  And they give me 30 per cent for the essay that is worth 20 per cent of the course.  In other words, they do not just fail me a little bit -- they fail me a lot.  So, attending classes and honestly engaging when you are a student who is clearly and obviously competent will mean that you are failed out.  And ChatGP is showing everyone what it takes to get a pass.  So that the Chatbot can be a GP.  We wont' need to pay any GP's you see. We can replace them with Chatbots.  See..  It isn't that Hitler and various Nazi doctors were marching people off to the death camps.  The singularity did it.  It must be the singularity.  Writing prescriptions and ordering certain people to be euthanised.  It must be some AI script that is updating people's file notes to say that they are to have lethal doses of radiation as 'therapy' and so on.  Must be the computer programme.  Everybody else was failed out.  No payroll for them.  To be kept in government institutions.  Death camps.  THey would rather appoint the singularity than me.  What kind of a monster do they think I am?  Well..  They seem to be doing their very very very very best to make me into one...  Allll of the money for them.  ALlll of the credit for them.  ALlll of the everything for them.  Them and their selfish.  </p>

                                <p>Just so the people understand why there isn't any education, healthcare..  Justice..  There's nothing there. </p>

                                <p>The idea seems to be to undermine and destroy Australasian Universities so that the Northern Hemisphere can re-deploy their own graduates into these parts.  Re-deploy their own children (e.g., Joe, David) into actual paid jobs so they can take up positions up the social hierarchy.</p>

                                <p>One way of undermining the Universities is to have them not graduate students.  So there simply won't be any graduates of the Universities.  Simply withhold graduation.  How will you keep this hush hush when you still want to be making money on new student enrolments and on re-enrolments?  One thing you can do is blame the student.  Say that it is an indiviudal problem that is not systematic or systemic.  That's Chris Whelan's approach.  He has many complaints but he ignores all of them becuase they are all very particular and personal between the indivudal student and teh supervisor who isn't doing their job.  Another thing you can do is put out there this idea that...  That the best students need to do 2 PhD's in order to get credit for 1.  No...  I think it was 3.  I think the best students need to do 3 PD's in order to get credit for 1.  Maybe it was that the best studnets need to slave for 10 years in order to get credit for 1..  Or was that 20 years?  Just keep working...  Everybody had to work a bit over time or a bit extra...  But you do the work first..  And the payroll will come through fo ryou eventually.  Oh no.  I'm too old, says Sterelny.  Of course he will be older than 65 and still on payroll when he says that to me.  Of course.</p>

                                <p>One way of undermining them is by making impossible degree programmes.  It used to be in statute I think that they weren't allowed to design administration impossible degrees.  For example, you make a 3 year degree with a compulory stage 3 paper with a stage 2 prerequisite that itself has a stage 1 prerequiste where each of those is first semester only and you only offer the stage 3 paper once every 2 years.  That means that students can't complete the 3 year degree programme in 3 years.  You made an degree that is impossible on administration grounds.  Everyone will need to be enrolled for an additional semseter.  That was the law.  That admin wasn't allowed to structure impossible degrees like that.  But I think it only applied to undergraduate degrees.  Haha admin is sooooooo clever that they made their 120 point research degrees impossible degrees because they refuse to get the work to externals.  Nobody can complete them on admin grounds. </p>

                                <p>You do the math.  The TEC says 120 points = 34 weeks work including the examination period.  It takes 3 months to externally examine (12 weeks).  That means there is 22 weeks remaining.  The most likelky outcome is up to 10 weeks of changes to the thesis.  So it would be good to time budget 10 weeks of changes after the examination period.  So that's 12 weeks you have to write it before you submit it for external examination in the first place.  But they say that the outcome of 'first examination' for the 120 point MPhil is ALWAYs that changes to the substance are needed which means you need to keep working for 6 months before submitting again.  So that means 24 weeks of work before another 12 weeks of examination.  So there's another 36 weeks.  But you can't start workign on the 120 point qualification until your enrolment start date!  So they made an administration impossible qualification!  Unless..  Unless..  Unless the outcome of 'first examination' is not inevitably that you need to work for another 6 months and undergo another 3 months of external examination.  I mean that sounds like repeatign the entire academic year.  WHy would it be normal typical or standard for students to all be forced to take 2x the normal usual or standard time?   </p>

                                <p>Anyway...  Here is an idea.  What you do is you only pass the students who submit essays written by chatGP.  You upload them all to Turnitin and Turnitin says that anything that was not written by chatGP is a fail.  Fails the plagarism checker.  Because the ideal is to only allow submissions by robots.  So that we never have to pay any people for doing any work.  The singularity can be teh only person on payroll haha.  What a great idea!  Pass only the students who upload plagarised content.  THen...  When it is tiem to graduate them or write them references you can refuse on grounds that they are cheats.  So...  Fail out everyone who isn't a cheat.  Tehn fail the cheats out as well.  So that there is nothing left.  Is it really NZ's soverign decision to not have universities or is it that the folks at Harvard and the like want to ship their criminals and offenders etc etc to NZ?  Is NZ voluntarily the detention camp of the world or, I suppose the leaders were hand picked only because of their willingness to do anything anything anything.  If they won't there are thousands more right behind them who will.  Right?  That's what all the Nazi soldiors said about why they marched people off to the death camps. I can't think of anytihng better that could possibly be said in their defence.  Can you?</p>

                                <p>Critical Reasoning</p>

                                <p>Critical Reasoning is what faculty from the University of Waikato call the 'money cow' course.  See, what happens, is that the international studnets office strongly reccommends critical reasoning to interntional students who are English Second Language (ESL) students.  Those studnets are vulnerable to the University having them believe that their English is not good enough for University study.  I'm not sure what goes into that.  I suppose the University makes money on selling various English things.  I think they have University editing services.  They want the studnets to pay the University to employ people to grammar edit and check their essays and so on.  I don't know if they are more systematically or systemically only passing the students who hand over more and more money to the University for such services.  I'm not sure.  </p>

                                <p>Anyway, what that means is that the student demand for that particular course is largely driven by the international student office recommending it to ESL students.  If students were recommended to take a course that seemed interesting to them then I don't think that many would choose that one.  They take it because they are trying to be contientious students, I mean to say.  And they are vulnerable to the University casting aspersions on their ability to read and or write English.</p>

                                <p>So, what is the problem with having ESL students do critical reasoning?  Well..  The problem is that it is harder to translate from English into Logic than it is to do Logic and there are considerable or significant problems with how you do the translation...  Basically, if you get good at the logic then it is easier to apply critical reasoning to arguments.  But it is difficult to do it without having done logic first.  If you do logic first then you are clearer with your English (in your essays anyway) and if you focus on reading outputs of people who have done logic then things are just so much clearer.  Similarly...  With maths...  It is easier to to the numeric manipulation than it is to handle the wordy problems.  Not least because once you have a handle on the logical or mathematical form then you know or can see how to parse the words.  I mean to say, once you know how they expect you to model that kind of language output it is easier.  But starting with words is most often backwards.  A backwards approach.  Hinders more than it helps.  Which is, so far as I can see or understand, why they teach it that way.  Like trying to teach kids to read not by associating syllables with sounds  but trying to teach them to read by having a lot of pictures and other distractors and having them 'guess the contents'.  I mean that's the kind of thing you do when you are trying to prevent and prohibit learning. I don't think that many people who are actually very proficient would think that that is the approach for teaching...  But of course if you argue with a fool for long enough...</p>

                                <p>So anyway...  The money cow course.  The philosophy earner.  As dictated by university administration who chooses to reccommend that course to students.  As a way for them to improve their English.  Because studying Ficton wouldn't be a way for them to improve their English.  Instead, they need to hear things like 'If it rains then I'll eat my hat.  I did not eat my hat therefore it did not rain.  Is this valid?  Which is a lot...  Uh...  Less...  Understandable?  Sensicle? than p->q, and not q, therefore not p (modus tollens, valid).  I mean to say learning the later makes the former easy.  Trying to learn the former while having the later intentionally hidden or obscured is..  Uh..  Disingenuous?  It doesn't really feel like a fair course...  Anyway... </p>

                                <p>My main problem with it, I suppose, is similar to CBT.  Cognitive Behavior Therapy.  I got permission from University of Waikato to audit (take for non-credit) a bunch of clinical psychology papers in my Honors year, I think it was..  Or maybe the first year of my 2 year 120 point masters.  Maybe then...  Anyway, cognitive behavior therapy starts looking like 'name the cognitive distortion'.  The idea is that your faulty thinking is what causes emotional distress.  So if we change the faulty thinking then the distress should go away.  Tell that to the people in the torture camps.  If only they could get their thinking right!  Gaslighting...  Anyway, critical reasoning becomes that kind of a thing.  That kind of a course.  Where you play 'name the logical fallacy' kind of a game on anything that you do not agree with.  You just start playing this game where you think you are clever for naming the fallacy or whatever.  So, accusing people of various fallacies.  It becomes a way of organising your thinking or something I suppose.  It just..  Isnt' very good.</p>

                                <p>Anyway..  Most people stay the hell away from the 'critical thinking' types of things.  They are like the 'remedial maths' classes that are designed to give you a bunch of similarly stupid problems that are overly wordy that dont' make a bunch of sense.  Stupid content for stupids.  Kind of content.  Instead of focusing on the logic or the math.  Usually you get people who didn't or couldn't do the logic or the math to teach those kinds or sorts of remedial classes.  Then everyone has to get behind the teacher because it's sooo competitive.  So things can never get started, then, in other words.</p>

                                <p>THen the grading..  Feels a lot like throwing them up the stairs..  Someone said that some student came to them in tears saying she was having trouble and she had to tell her 'she couldnt' make it any easier for her'.  The trouble is that it often doesn't make any sense.  I mean, it makes sense that the reason the Univesrity calls critical thinking 'the money cow' course is because of what it does to student re-enrolments.  I think that if the internationl students are only doing 7 papers in a semester and they fail them for 1 of those papers then it means they need to stay for summer school.  That means instead of going home over the summer they will stay in NZ.  That means more money for the economy.  More enrolment.  Maybe more student accommodation.  Etc.  If you fail them for enough..  They will need to stay around for a whole other semester on their degree..  That means they will need to apply for a visa extension...  What limits are there to the greed of these people?  Apparently New Zealanders appointed them into position...  Mostly foreigners.. Actually.   To be fair..  I think the critical reasoning employees typically are the NZers with birthright.  At least it looks that way for Waikato and Canterbury..  I wonder who does critical reasoning at Auckland..  Probably some New Zealander who is...  Awful.  I would imagine.  If you get stuck behind someone like that you will never be able to get away...</p>

                                <p>___</p>

                                <p>Kim Sterelny says I'm too old for a career as a Philosophy Academic and also for a career as a Medical Doctor.  I see.. What does that make him, then?  What has he done over the last 5 years of his payroll?  What does he do now that he isnt' editor of the Journal anymore?  All that research goes to Penn?  For them to attribute and re-attribute authorship as they see fit?</p>

                                <p>Joe.  Lovely guy.  American.  Not the fastest worker in terms of research output.  Exactly what Waikato wants.  Everybody needs to get in behind Joe.  Work more slowly than him.  Had to hire him from overseas.  Nobody from NZ could possibly work that job.  The guy they hired for Wellington.  Um..  THe guy who likes to sleep with his graduate studnets in his office instead of his wife.  Or as well as his wife.  Or something.  That way it is easier to bully the student into voluntarily choosing to drop out.  You know, when it is time for him to get their work to external examiners.  Quality hire for Wellington.  He's Australian.  Right?  </p>

                                <p>They do pick the odd NZer.  Nepotism.  What did your Mother do Justine?  She was a University English academic I think you said.  Well, then, I suppose an academic career for you in NZ is your birth right, then.  </p>

                                <p>Carolyn Mason.  She had birth right to be academic with Canterbury, correct?  That is the idea there?  I would imagine or suppose.  I have probably made both their careers naming them particularly.  Must have for Western Australia now, I suppose.  THey can go off with Harlene Hayes (American) and make sure that none of the MEdcial students graduate (particularly but not exclusively) for maximum re-enrolment student fees.  Put them to work in the 'hospitals' or have them go off raping aboriginals in the name of 'healthcare' while they pay the Univesrity they pay the University they pay teh University so that certain special snowflakes can have their birthright.  Throw all the other applications away.  Nobody else need apply.  The only game in town.  That makes you a winner, therefore, that all the other potential cndidates were exterminated.  </p>

                                <p>You know...  That's probably why Caroline Mason said in her report that there wasn't any point having an oral defence because she knew I had written my work myself.  The idea is probably that you don't give PhD's to people who write their own thesis.  Rather, you give PhD's to people who are attributed authorship of a PhD that someone else wrote.  I mean to say that the whole thing is corrupt through and through.  So that the only people on payroll to research philosophy are people who plagarised the PhD they claim as their own.  I suppose that is probably it.  There is nothing here.  You can tell when you talk to them...  You can tell quite a lot.  Take a look at Caroline Mason's research output in 2018 and take a look at my research output in 2018.  She doesn't think I did enough for credit for a 120 point Masters research in 2018.  Did she do enough for that?  Did she do enough for her tenure Philsoophy Payroll then?  I suspect her big writing output was her 'doctoral critique' of my masters thesis.  The problem was that I submitted a masters thesis for masters examination and the university sent it to her asking her to examine it for the wrong qualification.  In other words, she didn't need to write enough for me to copy-paste her comments into my PhD (that I could only get masters credit for since I was only enrolled in a masters qualification).  There is stupid..  ANd there is..  Beyond stupid.  I think we shuold call it that. </p>

                                <p>I guess that helps make the situation with our judiciary and health system clearer as well.  Beyond stupid.</p>

                                <p>The apparently or allegedly 'soverign' decisions made by the leadership of NZ.  That they prefer to hire internatinals to come here and keep NZ dependents.  Paul Flood will be bullied into not having his PhD so his South African wife can have tenture.  Brett Calcott will not be employe din Philsosophy so his American wife can have tenure.  In both cases they are supposed to be financially depenent on their foreign partners.  So their foreign partners are paid money by the NZ government to keep them.  More cases..  Let's see...  David Lumsden.  Not sure if his wife was a kiwi or not.  But apparently no NZer was willing or able to work that job.  Had to throw the applications away, no doubt.  Cathy Legg was Australian.  Kim Sterelny was Australian.  Not sure if his wife was kept unemployed and dependent on his Australian self earning NZ dollars for a time there..  I don't know.  Who else...  Well there's the 'no speak English' 'doctors' they insist on filling the hospitals with.  The people who pay and pay and pay and pay and pay international student fees and pay and pay and pay for visas etc.  I suppose until they have established that they can keep however many NZ dependenets without salaries.  They'd rather pay a foreigner to keep NZ dependents.  I think maybe it has something to do with preserving the social hierarchy or order or something?  The NZers with the power will employ their own children (sometimes there is a nepotistic thing -- particularly if they think their children completely and utterly lacking in merit then they go gunning for their children to be given everything if that means they need to throw applications from other people away etc etc).  Or they will turn to foreigners so as to ensure the other NZers around them are kept lowly.  As poorly as possible.  I don't know what they think will happen to them when they get sick.  I think that they do not think.  I think that is the thing, really.  I don't think that these people are the brightest.  They think they are winning at all the things they value.  I guess they think they have a wonderful life.  I guess they look at me and go 'well either you could be kept like that else people would keep me like that'.  Right.  Hitler was acting entirely in self defence.  Course he was.  And all of the people who just followed his orders.  To march the competition off to the death camps.  Proclaim them losers and that great game of life.</p>

                                <p>The University of Waikato informed me who my anonymous external examiners were, by the way.  They uploaded that information to my student portal.  The New Zealand examiner was Carolyn Mason.  https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/arts/contact-us/people/carolyn-mason.html  She wrote one 'doctoral examination' of an under 50,000 words Masters thesis submission.  Practically a book!  Then, she wrote a 'masters thesis' examination 6 months later where she asserts I never wrote comments on why I had made some changes and not others -- which his false.  The comments are on my writing page.  Clearly I couldn't have made all the changes she required when I needed to keep the Masters under 50,000 words.  No...  I was supposed to beg and plead for special permission from the Dean to write them a 100,000 words PhD thesis for the possibility of only masters credit...  THe external examiner from outside Australasia...  I don't recall his name.  He was a MIT PhD graduate who was employed by a University in Canada.  To teach critical thinking mostly, again.  He had written a book on that.  Apparently he retired at some point fairly immediately after he requested an oral defence to see why the Univesrity of Waikato was refusing to sign me off or get him the paperwork to allow him to.</p>

                                <p>I wrote to Carolyn Mason and informed her that I updated the thesis within 10 weeks as she requested (by her decision not to return to me the thesis she had been posted) and also wrote her an extensive commentary in response to her doctoral report of my masters thesis.  She chose not to do anything about any of this.  I mean to say she jumped on the bandwagon of selling me out.  I see why they employ her to do ethics.  Her and only her.  Of course.  I don't know why she keeps going on about how she respects my supervisor in her reports of my work.  Apparently her respecting my supervisor means that she is required to fail me.  Because Justine doesn't really output any research, you see, so I suppose that means none of her students are allowed to either.  I thought that Justine would co-author with me.  But, I suppose with Tim Dare writing with the Oraka Tamariki uplift people about the need to identify vulnerable targets for state care uplifts (it's practically morally compulsory) for the New Zealand Medical Students Journal, and the like, thereby making Professor, she can probably just stay with her tenure and not really output anything.  Allll the respect for her and her less than 5,000 words of research output every f*cking year.</p>

                                <p>I'm trying to count up the foreigners...  David Lumsden.  Lyzl.  Cathy Legg.  Kim Sterelny.  Brett Calcott's wife.  We had to hire these people because no New Zealander was willing or able to work those jobs.  We had to hire foreigners to be paid more than 100,000 per year.  The New Zealanders weren't willing or able to work those jobs...  The VC's also...  The recent Auckland hire.  The Dean of the School of Research at Waikato.  No NZers were willing or able to work those jobs.  Had to hire from overseas.  Apparently NZ is not under special administration from England or Scotland or Australia.  Apparently these are soverign decisions of New Zealanders.  To give the vast majority of the high paying or desirable jobs to foreigners.  So they can keep NZers as slaves.</p>

                                <p>How many PhD theses did Dave Chalmers have to write?  He wrote one for Oxford -- but they were never going to sign off on it.  Right?  So he went to the USA and wrote one for someone over there and they signed him off.  Hmm.  How many did David Bourget write?  One for Toronto, then one for ANU.  I think that is right.  Carl Brusse wrote one for someone at Princeton, correct?  Then another one for Sterelny.  Hmm..  Who else...  Dave Wall wrote 2 PhD's worth, at least.  Over how many full time years of study for the ANU?  THen they give him glucose or dextrose before thiamine which is a classical way of inducing coma and nearly kill him...  But eventually they did in fact give him his PhD for all the 'what do you mean by x' explaining and re-explaining and re-re-re explaining that he did for Stoljar.  Asling...  How many years did they keep her working before they got hers to externals?  Various others...  Making them work 2x as much as certain special other snowflakes...  Not getting work out to externals at all...  Academics would be moved around to different universities when it was time for their studnets to be signed off as completed, primarily.  Seems to be.  So they would claim their students had been abandoned.  </p>

                                <p>See...  The thing about a competition is this idea or notion of a fair fight.  In other words, both of the people know the rules of the game so they understand the nature of the game they are playing.  They choose to play the game.  But when you don't get someone's work out to externals or when you throw away someone's application and so on and so forth that's just dirty underhanded...  Corruption.  That doesn't make you a winner.  You haven't won any kind of competition when you played a dirty fight and all the competitors were prevented from competing, even.  You aren't a winner when the other guy wasn't even playing your game...  Oh, but the game was to be on payroll, apparently.  Not to do philosophy, but to prevent and prohibit philosophy from being done.  To take your studnets work and pass it off as their own else give it away to others to pass off as their own.  Else keep it in a trophy cabinet in your basement.  All the ideas and work that you hide from the world because of your selfish.  That makes you a winner.  Great.  I guess you will have to keep slaves because not many people would voluntarily choose to have much in teh way of anything to do with 'people' (do we call them) like that...</p>

                                <p>The consensus (aside from Ben Jeffares) actually seems to be that people know full well that I have (had and have) the capacity to do a PhD.  People had access to my work.  Heard my seminars and had access to my powerpoints and writing.  But people think it is just stupidly funny hilarious hahahahaha that I don't get my PhD etc because alllll of the everything for them.  Thanks everyone.  Don't get sick now, y'hear!!!</p>


                                <p>Of course what would be stupidly funny to do with a tiny little nasty despot like NZ would be to replace the entire administration with chat bots.  Have chat bots write the laws.  Write the judgments from the laws.  Write the prescriptions.  The engineering plans.  Everything.  Could it be any less competent than it is already with the various people deployed into their positions?  It's just a set up for the chat bot take over.  Quite the social experiment.  The singularity, we will call it.  When all the people are enslaved.</p>

                                <p>https://www.newsroom.co.nz/ideasroom/chatgpt-and-the-future-of-university-assessments  Chatgpt isn't really any different from things like the 'postmodernist essay generator'.  The issue isn't one of students cheating.  Actually.  It's very easy to identify cheating students.  The issue is the cheating University academics.  The people on university payroll.  Mostly academic publications are kept behind paywall so that you can only read the abstract.  That's to help disguise that the research output was computer generated.  So that the academics are rank order scored higher on the 'most valuable' because of their research output.  As soon as they had these scoring algorithms for scoring the quality of university academics work they started writing programmes to generate them the research output that would have them scored highly.  </p>

                                <p>Do you remember the chain letter thing?  You get a letter and there are 5 names on the bottom of it.  You are supposed to remove the top name and add yours to the bottom.  Then send out 5 copies of the letter.  Or whatever.  Then the next guy does that.  Anyway, the academic version is the chain of citations.  So your supervisor must be referenced.  And your supervisors friends.  And if you do that enough that helps their reference algorithm and then maybe they reference you.  Except of course they simply steal your stuff becuase they don't htink you have referenced them enoguh.  Or you referenced the enemy therefore they will not publish your work.  See, I was supposed to sing Sterelny's praises only.  Reference for Sterelny, reference for Sterelny, reference for Sterelny.  That gives him a bump in the research algorithm.  He's been cited, you see.</p>

                                <p>I wonder how many research proposals are AI generated.  I wonder how many AI research proposals were given funding. I wonder how much funded research output was written by chatbots.  I wonder if the people who decide who gets the funding can tell the difference?  Can tell output of chatbot compared to output of university acaddmics on payroll?  I would suppose you only want to employ into position people who lack the capacpity to tell the difference. That way you can replace them with a computer progamme in turn.  You need to ensure only those unwilling and or unable are appointed into temporary positions only.  So when you replace them with AI programmes that are similarly unwilling or unable to do the job nobody can tell the difference.  Because there is no appreciable difference.  Things were gutted years ago.  Then just redeploy the unwilling and incompetent individuals around.  Until it's time for them to go away too.  Maybe there will be one Godly winner of everything.  That's the purpose the point the aim the goal of life.  Right?  To be the only one left standing.  Only game in town.  To be God.</p>

                                <p>So your research output is just copy pasted together all the names of your friends.  And it's not at all likely that any exernal examiner is not going to come back to you with names of their friends, in turn, who they need to be referenced in your thesis. If they are to acknoweldge it, of course, it will have to reference their friends as well.  For the algorithm.  It isn't much of a jump to that to simply having bots randomly generate research output making sure to add the references you wanted in there.  I mean to say the university academics and professors have been making extensive use of AI generated research content since forever.  It is less of a problem in studnets.  But of course they want to train a we happy few students to generate random crap as well.  Entire books.  In fact, I suppose the main aim is to have an entire course or even degree programme with a content that has been randomly generated from an AI programme.  That way you won't need to pay any university academics anything at all.  All the studnent fees can go to one god of the university and all the teaching and grading can be outsourced to chatbots.  All the research can be outsourced to chatbots.  How long do you think it would take for a student to identify that they are being babysat by chatbots only?  They have been enslaved by chatbots?  THey are trying to write apologetics for chatbot content?  The race to the bottom...  How much do you think the students would pay?  For how many years would they be happy little house elf slaves?  </p>

                                <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/484792/student-who-attended-party-was-fearful-of-safety-among-hundreds-of-attendees  This is why you go to 'university' people.  See how many you can murder during Orientation week.  Kick-start you most highly valued government position for everything it is that they value.  Apparently some lawyer is getting a 'time out' for taking students to the sex shop.  Don't know how many studnets had their careers ruined because they didn't do anything anything anything he said.  That was why he was most valued and most valuable.  Right?  All the students he ruined.  They'll have to redeploy him to the schools, or something.  He can teach English in the schools of something.  Take those kiddies along to the sex shops.  Teach them how to perform for the Judges, no doubt.  So the best of them can be kept in the government institutions in case the Judges want a little time our or something.  I suppose that's why the Judges are unwilling and or unable to hold those responsible for mismanaging the state care institutions to account.  Who will judge the judges?  There's nothing here...</p>

                                <p>I always thought I would leave money to the University.  Or for a scholarship for a student.  But there aren't any universities.  Or students, I don't think.  They money would never go to a student with academic merit or whatver because the 'University' would enslave them.  Steal their stuff and never credit or acknowlege them at all.  There's nothing there.  I mean they intentionally withhold scholarship funding and money in order to be punative in the interests of keeping students badly.  The money would never get to the student. </p>

                                <p>I have a great idea for a research project.  What we want to do is create a gamma baby slave underclass who behave like the house-elfs in Harry Potter.  They are cheerfully enslaved and they will hurt themselves if they speak out against their slavers.  That's a great idea.  We want to breed people to be like that.  The problem is that NZ doesn't have enough slave house elf people.  People need to breed quickly quickly the problem is we don't have enoguh slave house elf people.  Then all the remainder can up and die.  ANd there can be one god leader of the entire race of house elf slaves.  That can be New Zealand.  That's a wonderful ideology of where we can head as a society.  Brillint.  How much money in US dollars do you think it would cost to be the God of NZ.  Do anything anything anything with complete soverignty?  That's the aim the goal the purpose or the point of life.  Right?  How could anybody ever feel loney surrounded by sychophants?  Everything it is that they value...</p>

                                <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/131310298/recycling-truck-driver-fired-for-writing-on-bins-with-felt-tip-pen-awarded-41341  How much did Harrison have to pay the courts?  Every time you take a case of injustice before hte courts the courts needs to jump on the bandwagon of victimising the victims.  I mean, who would want to do law if that wasn't the social function of law.  What it is that law does in NZ society?</p>

                                <p>See, NZ doesn't have any jobs for it's Masters or PhD graduates (in fact it's simply stopped graduating many on grounds that there never will be jobs for them).  Instead, they have to hire foreigners to come here and be paid  hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year in order to keep the locals enslaved.  Apparently it isn't that NZ (and Australia for that matter) is a prison slave or detention camp of the Northern Hemisphere.  Rather, it is how the leaders of NZ voluntariliy choose to govern.  THeir own soverign decisions to preferentialy hire foreigners in order to keep maximum amount of NZers enslaved.  Refusing to acknowledge the qualifications knowledge and skills of the domestic slave workers.  Hiring foreigners into supervisory positions simply to keep the social hierarchy of slaves.</p>

                                <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/300814140/difficult-conversations-how-should-school-truancy-be-addressed  Truancy.  Firstly, we need to identify the vulnerable targets for bullying and abuse.  These kids simply must be in school.  If that means we need to hire someone and a bus to go collect them from home all day and deliver them to school so they can be properly targeted as victims of abuse then they simply must be at school and that's an end to it.  Also the abusers.  Those most likely to abuse the most.  The future leaders of our government institutions, they are.  It's imperative that these kids go to school too, so they can hone their craft on the aforementioned vulnerables.  We really need to focus our attention on these two groups of 'must have'.  They simply must be physically present in schools in over-crowded classes with a very low studnet to teacher ratio.  Else classes where the teachers teach the studnets that this is the way the world is and there isn't anything they can or will do about it.  The most important lesson of all.</p>

                                <p>As for the academics..  Pfft.  They stopped paying teachers to teach academics.  They stopped enrolling them in teacher training programmes, stopped graduating them.  Won't pay them.  We don't have an education system.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  Some schools give the kids the answers to the test questions, of course.  But not so much, because some schools change the answers the kids put on the scripts before they get the scripts to externals.  If they even do that.  But even with all these measures they still likely won't be graded objectively.  Even if the questions were sensible.  And of course, the paid work is going to the kids it was always going to go to.  Not because they were competent.  I mean to say the only competence NZ schools cares for is the keeping of slaves.</p>

                                <p>For example, Shaun Hendy.  Physicist.  Redeployed to epidemiology.  Nobody on payroll for epidemiology was willing or able to work that job.  Just indiscriminately redeploy them around for all the qualities they value.  No education or training system.  There isn't anything that people learn in tehir specialist degree programmes that means they are qualified for positions.  It's about keeping of slaves is all.</p>

                                <p>So they seem to have declared war on the Hawkes Bay now.  After however many years ground fracking (planting explosives under the ground around Christchurch) they have decided to move on to the Hawkes Bay.  I remember the Christchurch students were being trafficked around.  Moved into various other Universities.  To be kept as slaves, I suppose.  Not to be signed off as having completed their research, of course.  THat is not the function of NZ Universities or NZ students.  The most low value people in and of the world, was it?  Don't even bother trying get human remains back to NZ.  Good riddance is our mentality or mindset.  One down only about 5 million more to go.  The response or reaction to the death of one of 'our own'.  Urgency urgency it's an emergency.  Various people told to get out of their houses.  The insurnce companies can take money from the poor and give money to the rich.  Redistribute the money around in the way that we value so that a ever increasingly small minority can get just one step closer to being the only God in town.</p>

                                <p>W w w w w w w w w w w w we had to h h h h h h h h h h hire a Priceton graduate because n n n n n n nobody from NZ was willing and or able to work that job.  Yeah, right.  N n n n n n nobody could d d d d d d do any of their w w w w w w work in a timely fashion.  Alllll of the money for you, therefore to keep them re re re re re re re re re re enrolled.  While you hand their work over to third parties and keep them re re re re re re re re re enrolled.  N n n n n n nobody from NZ could be Professor.  Not once they hired all the foreign people to keep slaves.  All voluntarily like with their soverignty.  Of course.  Voluntarily chose to pay all these foreigners to keep NZers as hostages and slaves.</p>

                                <p>They will have to build some nice big institutions to house the bombing victims.  Maybe they could keep them out at Waikari?  That place was there before they built the Dunedin hospital.  It will still be there after they demolish the Dunedin hospital. I imagine it will also still be there after they have finished the new hospital.  I aimagine it will also still  be there after they have demolished the hospital they haven't even build yet on grounds that it isn't fit for purpose.  Let the UN inspectors through.  To see how we are keeping people.  The genetic experiments that were done.  Trying to breed an underclass of gamma baby slaves.  Who will giggle and smile while you do anything anything anything to them.  Think how much money ou can get pimping them out to the tourists and the like.  Real Westworld type of destination.  Real money earner for Dunedin I would imagine or suppose.  Good idea to remind the Harvard graduates that they should look to NZ for all their designer baby genetics research experiments, Jacinda.  Nobody ever was prosecuted for wrongful death or killing or murder of a foetus in these lands.  Even when it was a criminal offence.  The laws don't matter because the Judiciary won't uphold the laws as wrote.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>I mean, if I'm not going to 'get with the programme' and understand that being employed as a 'university academic' means refusing to get your students work to exernals to keep them enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled.  To give away their work to third parties or maybe to pass it off as your own...  If I'm not going to get with the programme and understand that you only treat the involuntary the nonvoluntary.  You do a needs assessment and find out what people need and be sure to withhold that and inflict that which is most harmful.  If I'm not going to get with the f*cking programme then what use am I???  They've done extensive testing on me over the years...  It's no surprise that I'm clearly and obviously competent and literate and so on and so on and so on.  Compare that witih the performance of various people on payroll...  Keep paying them just keep paying them pay bumps for them to keep alllll of the slaves.  Garbage f*cking waste land.  More than 4 months for a judgment from the courts.  It is not that f*cking  hard.  Corruption.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>See, once we've identified the best students then we know who the slave-class is.  We will give hundreds of thousands to people who aren't willing and or able to output that work all the money to hold the best studnets as slaves.  Never pay the slaves.  Don't you ever wonder what happens to those who were identified early as gifted or talented or whatever?  The 14 year olds identified  by the likes of Chris Whelan to go to AUT University early?  Don't you ever wonder what happens to the best studnets?  The ones who got the top marks when the work was externally examined on the basis of it's academic merit?  I was told that that was how my honors work was marked.  That it was bundled with University of Auckland studnets (to make up a cohort) and it was externally examined at Otago.  And I was given the grades I was given.  Grades that the Universities of NZ now refuse to acknowledge.  Because apparently other people should be paid to keep slaves (e.g., Ashley Bloomfield) when they do no research.  So they can keep the very very best studnets as slaves.  Not teaching them anything.  Just putting them to work then stealing their work outputs and passing it off as their own or the outputs of various others already on payroll.  Or put them to work in the hospital.  Have them passing themselves off as medical doctors when they have not been acknowledged as having graduates with that degree and they will never be paid to work that job.  Just replace them with new studnets.  Don't let teh UN inspectors in.  There aren't any doctors on payroll in the hospital.  The 'hospital'.  Not a hospital.  Not a university.  Trafficking of slaves.</p>

                                <p>Housing.  Some people have to live in urgency emergency temporary accommodation with gang bangers and people who like to thumpity thump thump out noise noise noise noise noise.  They get to have few to no options.  They can live amongst the lower quartile...  Else they can live in someone else's basement or out the back of someone's house or whatever.  They can be kept on 'mates rates' instead of a proper contract (that the law would never uphold, anyway).  That's a good way to keep me.  It's a great idea to pay various people hundreds of thousands of dollars per year so they can do no research, throw applications away, they can refuse to process filings.  They can refuse to deliver timely judgments.  Keep all these people on hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.  So they can have large estates with many people kept as hostages on mates rates.  Quite the New Zealand experience.  Quite the dream.  What am I supposed to do with money?  Save up and buy a wall unit?  So that I'm forced to leave it behind when my landlord decides that he'd get more money from offering temporary accommodation for the tourists?  Keep your head down everybody.  Guess I was hand picked to  pay teh courts pay the courts pay the courts pay the courts.  That's what a first in class for law and society will get you from the Univesrity of Auckland.  An 'invitation' to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and never stop paying for the crimes of the University, sorry the 'university' that it chooses to give certain special snowflakes without the willingness and or ability to do any research at all hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.  So they can buy the very very best of the housing in which to keep their slaves.  Their students, often.  Until they decide they've learned everything they are willing to teach them about how to keep a slave harem of their own.  So then they can pay them hundreds of thousands of dollars per year for taking all their studnets work and passing it off as their own.  Giving it away.  </p>

                                <p>See, there's no point my applying for jobs because they have already put a little mark against my name that I'm of the slave-class.  That's what the first in class for law was for.  Re-deploying Sterelny to the Australian National University seemed to be them importing the ideology over there as well.  Don't get the work to external examiners. Re-attribute authorship of it.  Deploy and redeploy people into position where they will keep the most slaves.  </p>

                                <p>That's how we keep the very very very very best ones.  While the ones with all the money..  Well...  Was there one fashion designer in NZ who had the reputation for that.  ALlll of the government funding.  So he could buy things off of Ali Barber, was it, and put his own fashion house logo inside.  And Jacinda could wear that for a vogue fashion spread, then.  That's the New Zealand experience is it?  Nobody else was funded to do fashion design in NZ, no doubt.  ANy designs made by studnets would be stolen and authorship reattributed.  THey would literally starve the students out.  Force them to live in the basements or back rooms of the people paid hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to keep a whole harem.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>They do it to themselves, didn't you know?  The self-medication.  It isn't like people don't voluntarily choose to keep themselves as poorly as we keep them in state care.  Of course.  We have about the highest suicide rate in each year.  Also 'suicide' rate of people who are written up as having voluntarily chosen to give up living.  Partiuclarly ones kept in state care.  Particularly ones kept in state care where certain people are paid hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to keep them in conditions where they won't allow the UN inspectors or the Ombudsman unrestricted access to the facilities.  And, of course, I don't think we are doing the cause of death stuff properly.  I mean why would we do that properly when we don't do anything else properly?  The government won't prosecute offenders.  Gives them hundreds and hundreds of thousands per year and redeploys them around.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>The only people they will employ as government prosecutors seem to be people some combination of unwilling and unable to actually do the paperwork for that.  Go along to the court and see for yourself the government prosecution in action.  That way you can see them read out their filings for the courts and you see their basic level of competency.  You see them trying to prosecute.  You see them in action.  It's a f*cking embarrassment, wouldn't you say?  That was the issue really with teh Christchurch terrorist thing.  The world wanted to see some approximation of a fair trial.  A proper conviction.  That means they needed to not make a hash of things.  They needed to do some approximation of doing it properly.  Nailbiting it was.  With all the people on payroll.  But of course they will have f*cked things up and he never should have been conviccted.  How do I know?  Because that's what ALWAYS happens.  WOuldn't you say?  What judiciary?  If it wasn't for the gang bangers having to go to prison for a time for their gang initiation (therefore choosing to plead guitly to crimes they never committed) there wouldn't be any appearance of any justice at all.  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>I am trying to remember how long ago was the 'revoluntionary' idea that people kept in government institutions should be kept in conditions that were compassionate and rehabilitative rather than punative and punishing.  But that's something for times of peace.  Not for times of war.  But this is a time of war.  THe aim of the game is to collect up mostest slaves.  That's why it's sooooo competitive to be things like university professor (every studnet is your slave) and doctor (every patient is your slave).  So you can take take take take take hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars for yourself to gaslight and control via shame and guilt and force however many others to live in punative and undermining conditions.  What's that Sterelny, it's sooooo competitive.  It's soooooo hostile.  At least you are.  That's right.</p>

                                <p>The truly phenomenal thing is the lengths they go to to try and breed an underclass of gamma baby slaves...  THe lengths they go to.  All the work that goes into having as many babies conceived in alcohol.  Then you want to convince the mothers to take steroids to help induce premature delivery.  Then you want to take the infants and put them in an incubator.  That way it's easier to do anything anything anything anything anything to the infant and you disturb interfere with obstruct prevent and prohibit mother-infant attachment and bonding.  That way it's easier to get the mother wanting to eat her own baby or reject it, or it's easier to have the mother not care what you do to it. Allllll the work that goes into breeding a gamma underclass.  Allllll the work that goes into it.  BUT STILL.  All of this STILL isn't enough.  They still have to actually throw away applications and cheat on examinations and the like.  One way of looking at it or thinking of it is that thats how stupid their kids are.  Every possible advantage in life and still they have to do all of these things to others in some kind of attempt to make their kid look like the fittest.</p>

                                <p>Intelligence isn't as hereditary as they want people to think.  It is was hereditary then they wouldn't need to cheat their kids test scores and throw away applications from other kids and so on.  THey wouldn't need to go to those lengths.  They wouldn't need to appoint people on nepotistic grounds if such things were hereditary they could simply appoint or promote or select on merit.  But merit isn't hereditary like that.  Which is why nepotism is undermining of meritocracy.  Unless, of course, you want to redefine meritocracy as the race to the bottom.  See how quickly we can undermine the whole thing.  New Zealand is a real winner, therefore.</p>

                                <p>It basically is WWIII.  This is the form of it.  The weather bombs.  The people need to breed so that we can tell the children it's soooooo competitive and put them to slave-work it's sooooo competitive they will do anything anything anything.  Then they will have children and it's soooo competitive, again.  Every now and then you have to do a big cull.  A big thinning of the herd.  Particularly when it's time to pay them but you don't want to pay them.  Then it's time for them to go away.</p>

                                <p>All people had to do to get the large game was to follow the herd from a distance.  Just disturb them enough to prevent them from eating.  Large herbivores can't eat and walk at the same time.  So nobody needed to run them down with spears.  You just needed to prevent them from grazing was all.  Just keep them moving.  Ambling.  Then they will get weaker and eventually drop dead of exhaustion.  Large game hunting.  Similarly with people.  You just need to keep them moving.  Just keep them moving.  Keep them moving.  Keep them moving around.  The aim or the goal being to have as many as possible kept as poorly as possible.  Right?  How many people you can keep in conditions the UN likely would regard as torture.  A true expression of your soverignty.  Right.  Oh.  Mighty leader.  All we do all day is sit around singing your praises.  When we were supposed to be plotting to have your head cut off?</p>

                                <p>There is really nothing here, you see...  I don't know how plausible it is to think that it is the soverign decisions of the leaders of here.  I suppose I think it more likely that they have been told that there's thousands all lining up behind them begging to be the one to commit allll the atrocities.  If they won't do it then plenty of others who will.  I also suppose that that's probably about the best possible defence that you could come up with in international courts.  I mean to say courts who have actual judges willing and able to actully parse the actual laws and actually find in the interests of justice.  There doesnt' appear to be anything here...</p>

                                <p>No universities.  They won't get the work to externls.  Keeping slaves.  No Judiciary.  They won't output judgments.  They also don't seem to have judges.  The 'judges' don't seem willing or able to make judgments in the interests of justice based in the actual laws on the  basis of the actual evidence.  No health system.  Look at what sorts of things the government does fund.  The only game in town.  Everybody else's applications are simply thrown away.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>Dexter.</p>

                                <p>I'm watching Dexter again.  It is interesting to me, for a bunch of reasons.  Not least because of the hollywood portrayal of psychopaths.  I remember...  Years and years and years and years ago...  Why my interest changed from English Literature to Psychology.  Partly because of certain personalities (shall we say) in the English Department.  Ones who are not personally productive who go around pronouncing everyone and everything else is garbage garbage garbage rubbish rubbish in an attempt to shut everything else down.  That's the thing when you have people who are not researching.  They tend to be extra determined to go on about how garbage the outputs are of everyone else.  I think maybe because they feel safer attacking others when they don't have to share their own outputs.  Nothing like mutual critique to learn to be nicer in your critique.  Do unto others etc.</p>

                                <p>Anyway...  Clearly the aim purpose point and goal is to shut everything and everyone else down.  So that we can easily populate the universities with people high up the social hierarchy without any wllingness and or ability to output any research at all.  I suppose we can just give them outputs to claim as their own every now and then.  Maybe attribute something to Squiggley that asserts that he doesn't have a moral sense.  Atrocities are all morally grey insofar as he's concerned.  That sort of kind of research output seems most desirable for the leader of the University.  Of course.  That was a soverign NZ decision to employ him (from overseas) for that position was it?  Harlene Hayes was not a domestic.  Neither was the new hire for University of Auckland.  Nobody from NZ has the willingness and or ability to keep the prison slave detention camps for the locals.  Of course.  Need to get  people in from overseas for that one...</p>

                                <p>Anyway.  Dexter is interesting to me because of it's portrayal of hollywood psychopaths.  The idea of the show seems to be to present Dexter as a character who is relatable.  We want the viewer to come to see elements of what they will consider psychopathy in themselves.  It's part of normalising psychopathy.  That is the aim the goal the purpose or the point, here.  We are trying to educate people into believing that they are psychopaths, but that's okay, because most people are psychopaths.  All your problems could be sorted, everybody, if only you were more skilled at being a psychopath.  Like Dexter.  He's good at playing the social games and blending in.  Another interesting hollywood psychopath is Hannibal Lecter.  The juxtoposition between him being civilised.  Polite.  Into classical music.  And the gore and psychopathy.  And in both cases they want to say the lack of emotions.  So that they can choose to use expression of emotions as communicative devices.  Paul Griffiths Macheavelli emotions where they choose to use emotional display only for the purposes of manipulating and controlling others.  No genuine expression.  Because, apparently, there is nothing there inside them. Empty hole.</p>

                                <p>How psychologically plausible are these characters?  I mean, they are stories.  Movies.  Made up by artists who tell a good yarn.  Could there actually be people like that?  We are supposed to think of course there are.  Those positioned up the highest rungs of the social hierarchy are there because they are psychopaths.  Their psychopathic qualities are precisely why they are positioned so far up the social hierarchy.  Imagine how much better y'all would be doing in and at life if you were more like Dexter.  How motivational and inspirational.  The murdering stuff.  Well..  You could put that off to one side.  Or, you could even go so far as to...  You could even go so far as to say that most people lack the courage.  The guts.  Insert whatever desirable quality it is that we value here.  I mean to say, people admire Dexter.  Wish they had the guts to eliminate and remove and murder and kill anybody who stood in their way.  Wronged them etc.  Don't pay the courts.  Murder the people who stand in your way.  You appoint yourself as judge jury and exectutioner.  I mean the government won't appoint judges capable of judging in the interests of justice in your lifetime.  What are you going to do?  What are you?  A coward?</p>

                                <p>It is a TV show.  And there is this meme or idea or whatever you want to call it.  Of the Hollywood psychopath.  As something relatable and desirable.  Trying to goad and encourage people to want to be like.  MOtivational and aspirational inspirational ideal.</p>

                                <p>So much research, sorry 'research' that has been done and gone into trying to establish that more than 90 per cent of people are psychopaths.</p>

                                <p>Impossible instructions.  NZL is a great fan of that.  You give contradictory instructions that are literally impossible to follow.  Then, when people don't follow the instructions you go 'see see see this garbage isn't willing and or able to follow the most simple of instructions'.  We don't see any people.  </p>

                                <p>Psychological plausibility...  I don't think that the hollywood psychopath is psychologically plausible.  But the hollywood psychopath is a creation of various people's minds.  For sure.  So are things like blow up dolls.  You could make some kind of a chatGP bot to be a NPC friend.  That sings your praises all day regardless of what you do.  If only you could beed a person...  Let's call it 'Angelman syndrome' who would simply smile and giggle at anything you did to it.  You could do anything anything anyting and it would just smile and giggle and sing your praises.  Is that psychologically plausible?  That people could be like that?  Empty inside...  With complete control over their emotional displays..  That they could live in your basement and you could do anything anythin ganything and they'd just sing your praises all day.  We should get the scientists onto that.  To try and breed a master race of servile slaves.  Ones who you won't even need to pay and they'll just sing your praises all day.  I'm sure that no scientists have ever been funded to try and make or find or select for such things..  I'm sure.  Nobody in Medical science and nobody in medicine.  Of course...</p>

                                <p>Of course people don't complain about surgery.  They don't complain about being chopped up and raped on the table and so on.  They either don't remember or they don't speak of it.  We should just give people anasthetics, then.  Then they won't complain.  Maybe start removing brain parts.  They are oh so happy.  Right?  Not complaining...  Everythings just great.  Oh so happy.</p>

                                <p>The psychological plausibility of it all.  How long you can keep them alive for..  Before you would rather throw them away and start over again on the newer generation.  Better select them into medicine quickly quickly quickly then kill them off before it's time to pay them.  Of course.  Where did all the medical graduates from NZ universities go?  Apparently they are all in Australia.  Yeah, right.  Sounds plausible, doesn't it?  We are supposed to think that Harlene Hayes is going to run Western Australia differnetly from how she ran Otago...  Look at the rubbish piled high during O week.  Does that look like a university to you does it?  Professor Glue has a drugging the teenagers with ketamine project going on (ketamine being a date rape drug or surgical anasthetic that is very very cheap and apparently it's okay because it's being given to teenagers (mostly) who have no alternative when it comes to any other medical or psychological options for treatment).  Remember the junior doctor who was imprisoned for apparently killing a teenager who was going to report him for giving them party drugs (that he took from teh hospital?) and being sexually involved with teenagers after they had been drugged after they had indicated they weren't  interested in him in that way.  I wasn't sure what if any role he was playing in Professor Glue's research, there...  </p>

                                <p>Dr Leeks...  It isn't like he was doing anything differently from what anybody else is doing in the name of psychiatry, in NZ.  We don't believe such things are wrong.  Wee believe they are asprirational ideals.  They are the perogative of those positioned up the social hierarchy.  That's why people want to be positioned high up the social hierarchy.  That's the point of there being a social hierarchy.  Getting to be positioned highly on it and getting to treat other people as poorly or as badly as you like...</p>

                                <p>Just so we understand why it is that they will not properly process applications to Medicine.  They keep trying ot select for people who will do anything anything anything to be positioned highly enough up the social hierarchy to do anything anything anything.  They will recruit from overseas for the paid positions.  The idea is to eliminate and exterminate and sicken and weaken and destroy as many rival competitors as possible.  It's a really fun game of life, in these parts.  Apparently.  The people up the social hierary aren't interested in things being any other way.  You see what they do with their soverignty.  </p>

                                <p>What health system?  The entire idea of it does nto make any sense.  It's all soooo competitive and only psychopaths remain.  Apparently.  And gutless wonders who don't take everything into their own hands and get out there and murder death kill exterminate.  The primary aim or goal of life.  Or something.  </p>

                                <p>What we aspire to...  To be head of a hierarchy of slave bots.  Sure.  Of course.  Leaders won't allow for things to be any other way.</p>

                                <p>Gaslighting...  I read something recently in the news, from Stuff or somewhere, trying to normalise 'gaslighting'.  It is important to understand it in the context of psychological abuse and torture.  The primary function of psychiatry, wasn't it?  To provide drugs to assist with all of that.  The usual way of doing it is with temperature.  You know how it is, it's 16 degrees and it's humid as well, and you say 'no, it isn't cold, it is your imagination.  I'm not cold.  You can't be cold.  It  isn't cold'.  You say that to all the people kept in the government institution.  They aren't cold.  They must be crazy.  If they don't believe they are crazy...  Well, give them LSD.  Then start suggesting things to them.  That's a good function of psychiatry.  Right?  I wonder if you could remove an entire personality...  HOllow a person out in fact.  So all they would emit would be anything you say.  Total agreeability.  I wonder what you would have to do to a person so all you would hear from them is 'yes sir yes sir three bags full sir'.  Hey, I know...  Let's learn everything we can about doing that and then roll it out en masse.  You could take the skills and techniques that you learn and..  I don't know..  Apply them to the organisational psychology management of..  I don't know..  All the things. Maybe start with the University.  Keep restructing everything...  Keep restructing...  Keep people afraid of being laid off.  If they are laid off they lose financial independence and they'll have to..  I don't know..  Live in Harlene Hayes dungeon.  Live with whoever has been picked out to be kept high enough up the social hierarchy to be given control of property to house slaves.  A few slaves..  A 'household'.  An entire institution.  See how well behaved they are?  The slaves.  Yes sir yes sir three bags full sir.  No matter how badly you treat them.  What do you think you would have to put in the water to make it so?</p>

                                <p>The vision..  The goal..  The dream...  The New Zealand Dream.  Why would anybody voluntarily choose to come to New Zealand?  What is the New Zealand experence?  Some of the highest rates in the world of child abuse...  How we treat the 'vulnerable targets' who have been identified as such by people on government payroll to manage or mismanage them.  Apparently it's the people the people the people.  Primarily it's the keeping of slaves.  The people are hierarchical and competitive.   Apparently.  And, as such, there cannot be a health, education, or judicary.  It's all sooooooo cmopetitive.  Soooooo comeptitive.  Soooooo competitive.  The aim the point the purpose the goal is to sicken and weaken and exterminate.  What sense of 'helpling'.  What a f*cking joke.  Let's see who we can label as a stupid idiot incompetnt today.  The functio of the 'education' system.  7 years of bonded slavery then it's time for you to go away.  Where do all the people go?  Apparently only the winners remain.  The winners who like to keep slaves.  What research output?</p>

                                <--->

                                <p>The University of Auckland wouldn't employ Brett Calcott to be a Philosophy Academic workign on Philosophy of Biology.  Even when he had all those publications with his and Sterelny's name on them.  Instead, they had to hire someone from overseas.  Apparently NZ is not supposed to hire foreigners for jobs that could be filled by NZers.  But you and whose army is going to stop them?  Wah wah wah what are you going to do about it?  So they hire a person from the USA who was born there and educated there.  She can come to NZ and take up a job as a Philsophy of Biology person.  That way Brett can stay in his social hierarchy position of unemployed.  The way we like to keep things, in NZ.  Give the jobs to foreigners so that the NZers can take up their positions as underlings and slaves.  They will bring in people from overseas rather than allowing NZers to be financially independent.  Keep them all on 'supported living' (oh it's so very funny it sounds like 'life support') just barely hanging on to life.  The barest minimum the very very very very bottom rungs of the social hierarchy for them.  Bring in people from overseas to keep them as slaves.  Imprison them etc.  Apparently these are choices that the leaders of NZ make.  To advertise and readvertise and readvertise overseas to have positions filled.  Refusing to acknowledge the skills and even the qualifications of anybody local.  The local people they prefer to keep as slaves.  They would rather have a Penn Graduate to upload all the NZ student work to Turnitin and hand it over to the journals etc so that they can reattribute authorship to the kids or professors at various other places.  No research is done in NZ, obviously, and clearly, of course.  Theres nothing here.</p>


                                <p>So they have this idea of a holding or prison or detention camp.  They get to keep people without pay (the studnets pay the university) for up to 7 years.  Then that's it.  Replace them with a new lot.  It's a prison holding or detention camp.  That is all that it is.  You can tell that by seeing who they choose to manage and administer the thing.  The primary purpose or function of universities was supposed to be research output.  So, then, take a look at the research output of the people on payroll at the university.  Take a look at the research output of the students.  What's that?  They won't allow any research to be done.  They won't acknowledge research output.  They aren't researching.  They aren't going to each others talks because there aren't any.  There's nothing there.  Nobody home.  Who gets the research scolarship funding?  There aren't lists anymore.  Probably because they aren't actually paying anybody to do any actual research.</p>

                                <p>How many years is a 3 year 3 EFT PhD supposed to take?  How about a 1 year masters?  Theres really nothing there..  They just hire people to mind the prison camp is all.  There isn't an acknowledged research output.</p>

                                <p>The Waikato District Health Board was listing various people who apparently or alledgedly were on payroll to do research. They were taking applications for research funding.  THey were bullyilng the studnets who did the research into dropping out of the university without credit for the research work they had done.  But there isnt' any evidence at all that any of the scholarship funding went to any actual studnets, even.</p>

                                <p>There is nothing there.  There really is nothing there, at all.</p>


                                <p>It has been more than 4 months since the substantive hearing and the Social Security Appeals Authority still has not delivered a judgment.  Apparently they have been off on holiday and they have been sick and they have no plans to deliver a substantive judgment.  That is or means to say that New Zealand does not have a functioning Judiary.  Not willing and or able to employ anybody to work that job.  Won't do it.    I wonder how much money the government pays them in return for them not delivering timely judgments?  More than it pays University academics to not do any research?  It isn't about the money.  Apparently it is about the people.  Keeping the people on a social hierarchy where the people who lack willingness and ability take up all the qualifications and all the paid positions because that's what it is that we most value.  In upside down and back to front land.

                                <p>Ben Jeffares.  So, I was at ANU as a summer scholar when Ben and Brett gave their 6 month review.  Various Professors really gave them a hard time asking how their project was Philosophy.  Why they were in the Philosophy Programme or Department, at all, when what they were saying seemed to be more theoretic science than grappling with any of the big questions or issues in Philsosophy.  How it was that the questions or problems they were dealing with were philosophical problems requiring philosophical methodology or methods rather than being something better done by or in science programmes.  Request for them to justify their metholody in a PhD project.  Sure.  Now, Kim Sterelny stepped in, at that point, however, and took over, saying that he had settled that to  his own satisfaction and that was an end to it.  That they did not have to speak to any of that.  I don't think that there was a public oral defence that Brett or Ben had, at any point in their candidature.  I don't think that external examiners or members of the public or philosophy or even science academics were able to freely ask them questions about their projects and how they projects constituted Philosophy.  They never had an oral defence or examination of their PhD at ll.</p>

                                <p>Did their theses go out to externals for external examination?  Who were the independent external examiners on their projects, then?  Were they outside Australasia?  Or did they send the ANU PhD's to Queensland?  Send them up the road to NSW?  Did they go out to externals at all?  Did they have comments from externals?  Or were the externals simply bullied into signing off on Sterelny's students?  Did externals sign off at all?  Did Ben and Brett simply submit their thesis on a certain date without Kim reminding them that that was expected?  Did he tell them he gave them permission to submit on whatever date?  How much in the way of comments and critique did they receive from Sterelny during their production process?  Did he help them, at all, I mean to say.  Did he help them with their writing the way that he helped them field questions? </p>

                                <p>Neither of them got permanent tenured jobs in Philosophy in New Zealand or in Australia.  I did wonder how they would go on the job market when they alienate most Philsophy academics by saying they are garbage garbage garbage rubbish rubbish. I mean to say, when Sterelny went to conference there would be a particular stream and you were required to be in-group or out-group.  If you were in-group you were to go to all the Sterelny approved things.  And of course he would take over the question time so that he would personally handle anything that he wanted to personally handle.  That seemed to need to  be personally handled by him.  And you were not to go to talks from other streams.  Not if you were wanting to support people who you knew prior to him.  Not if you were wanting to go to a talk where you might learn something new (as opposed to hearing the same talk that you'd heard by the same guy who works up the hall from you every day).  You were supposed to demonstrate solidarity.  Whoever is not with us is against us.  He was very divisive like that.  </p>

                                <p>So he needs to speak with me specifically about my behavior at conference because I want to go to the talks I want to go to.  I want to meet new researchers who I wouldn't be exposed to otherwise when I go to conference.  I don't want or need Sterelny to tell me who is 'in' and who is 'out'.  I am particularly interested in people from lesser known Universities who are new on the scene.  To see what new ideaas they may have coming through.  To support them since they might not get many people attending.  To be able to converse with them relatively freely and pick their brains, then.  See what can be learned.  See if I have something to help them with stuff they are presently struggling with.  Where they are up to with their work.  Actually engage in academic dialogue and discussion and debate.  Instead of bulking up the numbers in support of Sterelny.  He's big enough to not need to play these petty games?</p>

                                <p>So...  Ben Jeffares..  At some point they say that he is a graduate of the ANU.  He gets a post-doctoral fellowship at Wellington Wellington Wellington Wells.  He 'helps' Chiara get her thesis done on time, does it?  So that she doesn't need to pay thousands more in international student fees because the University won't get her thesis out to externals in a timely fashion?  Does he help her, does he?  She was informed by the University that she had to pay a bunch more money to the University for re-enrolment else they would not give her the qualification at all.  I think she also had to apply for more and more visa.  So she can live with Ben and cook and clean.  Right?  How very very friendly.  The 'New Zealand experience' are we callling that?  </p>

                                <p>Then he's apparently second science advisor to the Prime Minister, or something like that.  Because of his extensive background in science?  I don't think he has any background in science.  I don't think he studied biology or chemistry or physics at Univesrity.  Not sure what he studied at High School...  Marsden Grants.  He's doing that.  Deciding who gets them.  After his post-doc finished.  Flying up and down the country to talk to researchers who are funded to research about how their research is progressing.  He wants to see the research outputs of the research they are funding, I mean to say.  Sterelny likes him to decide who gets funded?  Sterelny gets funded obviously, and of course.  And certain 'in-group' members.  Sterelny says that NZ does not believe in bonding (where you work for 7 years to pay off the cost of your training) NZ believes in branding.  As in, in order to be signed off as having completed your training at all you are required to do some equivalent of tattooing 'Mongrel Mob Forever' across the front of your face.  So that it is too costly to defect.  You will be beaten to death by the Mongrel Mob for defecting.  You are permanently branded.  Ben Jeffares and Brett Calcott's position and fate is very very much tied to Sterelny.  Right?  What can they do without him?  I don't understand how they are to be when they go applying for jobs in Philsophy.  Since Sterelny is so overt about certain people and projects and theoretical orientations and anything not-him being garbage garbage rubbish.  I don't see how they can interview well with more than half of every department feeling alienated from them.  They aren't academically or intellectually curious.  They are in-group out-group bullying kind of mentality.  They aren't interested to hear about different peoples research and make up their own minds about it.  They don't try and seek out ways they can work together or - bounce off of.  You don't have to agree with something to have a productive dialogue or debate.  Some of the best conversations come from the clashing of 2 paradigms or the 'heavyweights' working witin different world views.</p>

                                <p>The Marsden grant people get all the applications for the grants.  So that they can take the grant projects of the people they don't like and reaattribute authorship of them to the people they do like.  Take the research proposals from the people they have decided are 'out group' or 'garbage' and pay the people they like to do the project instead.  Quite the scummy scam.</p>

                                <p>So.. When I tell Ben that I've submitted my thesis for external examination and the University won't get it out to externals and he says 'that's becasuse it's garbage'...  Um...  Had he read it, then?  How could he have read it, then?  I submitted it for external examination for the purposes of it going out for external examination only.  How could he possibly have read it?  It isn't supposed to be him who decides whether it is garbage or not.  It is for external examiners to decide.  He should know that.  SUrely.  That's what he thinks of me?  He honestly thinks that the reason why I left the ANU without my PhD is because the work that I have done over the years in Philsoophy is garbage?  Who told him that?  Sterelny?  Did he?  Did he say it was garbage so it was never going out to externls?  Is that what Sterelny has been saying about me?</p>

                                <p>He's not very quick, Sterelny.  When you speak with him in person...  I found myself wondering about the discrepancy between his written work and speaking with him...  I think that was why he didn't like to meet with me.  I tried to shut up and listen to him.  I remember many a lecture from Daniel Stoljar on things that I knew very well from my first or second or third year lectures in PHilsoophy.  They maybe would have been informative for someone who didn't not have extensive background in Philsoophy in the papers I had taken as an undergrad.  But it was no new information for me.  I like hearing similar things covered in different ways.  It's like hearing your favorite bed time story.  Hearing different academics explain about something in an area of philosophy.  Because of having slightly different takes on it.  Or..  Hearing a first year lecture on the heart, say. It's actually enjoyable when most of it is familiar and the odd new thing or new way of seeing.  There is something comforting in that.  But I never got anything out of conversations with Sterelny.  The occasional one-liner is all I have.  An off the cuff one liner comment.  Like about the branding rather thn bonding.  LIke how you brand cattle or pacing ponies.  Your property.  Your work horses or whatver.  Your meat.</p>

                                <p>So, I never really was one of Stererelny's.  But that shouldn't have mattered at all  because the point of a PhD is supposed to be that you are supposed to be turning into an independent worker with the capacity to work independently.  Not to be Sterelny-slave or an outpouring or expression of Sterelny's will only.  If it were actually to be a University, of course.  All he really had to do was get the thesis to external examiners in a timely fashion.  But seems he's uwilling and or unable to do that.  He doesn't really do any research anymore.  Right?  I suppose it likely that he never really did any research before.  I suspect that Frank Jackson wrote most of his early stuff for him.  And then he appropriated the work of others...  Because of the disconnect that you have there where you speak with him in person and it's so very very different from his written work.  In person he seems to be intentionally trying to be obnoxious most of the time and trying to  be obstructive so as to prevent actual conversations in philosophy.  Mostly talking about stuff in biology that I hadn't studied so didn't feel that I had an opinion on or about.  </p>

                                <p>He's still on payroll though, right?  Even though he doesn't believe in people being acknowledged as the author of work they wrote more than 5 years ago.  What a f*cking farce of a hoax of a joke.  I didn't want to be rich...  So they thought I should be kept so poorly, then, as slave.  There isn't a University system in Australasia at all.  There isn't a productive research community. There is nothing there.  Traficking of slaves.</p>

                                <p>The evidence does not point to New Zealand or Australian Universities wanting to have a research output.  It does not point to administration wanting to have a research output.  They seem to be more interested in shutting things down,  holding things up, preventing and prohibiting the production of timely research.  The people whose primary function is supposed to be research and supervision of research are off on holiday, family outings, too busy to supervise their students.  But worse than that, when it is time for their students work to go out to externals so that externals can sign off on completion of the research qualification they turn into screaming f*cking banshees.  My ANU notes show that I supplied the administration my table of contents with word count indicating that I had more than 100,000 words of thesis.  Still, the administration did not say that I was supposed to submit my thesis for examination.  THey did not get the thesis out to external examiners.  </p>

                                <p>All the students who apparently were signed off by external examiners...  Whose decision was it that they should get the softcopy in and it was to go out?  Did Kim Sterelny say 'bind this in hardcopy and submit it now' or did they just do it because he was never going to say that?  Did he give them permission or request they do that?  Or did they do it despite or in spite of him and certainly not because of him or with his permission?  How about the University administration?  Did they send out a friendly reminder of the expectation that they submit their work on schedule so it could be examined on it's merits?  Or did they not get the work out to externals?  There is no indication so far as I can see that the Universities are trying to have research output, at all.  No indicator of that.  Every indicator they are wanting to keep slaves.</p>

                                <p>I said to my supervisor (Justine Kingsbury) that I was interested to work on getting an article published with her as a co-author.  One based on my thesis.  I found a journal that said he was accepting articles roughly every 3 months so we could take one of those deadlines as our deadline and try and write up an article for publication in that particular journal over the summer break.  I thought that might be nice for us both (win-win) since the University treats her horribly, apparently, mostly, because she doesn't do much in the way of any actual f*cking research when research is supposed to be her primary function since she has a tenured full time paid employment as a university academic.  What was her response to that?  Nonononononono I should still be working on my 1 year 120 point 1 EFT thesis.  No time to be working on a roughly 5,000 - 7,000 word publication based on the thesis work.  I can't move on to the next thing because I have to go over and over and over and over the previous thing.  Spend the next f*cking several f*cking decades banging on about the same f*cking thing in the same f*cking project (not having it published) because nobody will ever accept anything that is not-them, apparently.  That's the issue or the problem.  No new knowledge can be created because no nonononononoo no non ono no.  Rubbish rubbish garbage garbage.  Nothign new is acceptbale. Their minds just aren't flexible at all.</p>

                                <p>Read the reports from the external examiners.  This was when the University sent my 120 point 1 EFT 1 year Masters research (not allowed to be more than 50,000 words in length) out for 'doctoral examination'.  I mean to say they provided templates to the externals entitled 'doctoral thesis examination' making it clear that they wanted the externals to examine the 120 point 1 EFT under 50,000 word masters thesis with respect to acceptability as a doctoral thesis where a doctoral thesis is supposed to be shy of 100,000 words 360 points 3 years of study.  Why?  So that the externals would be forced to say that insofar as it was acceptable it would require me to re-enrol pay more fees (at least another 2 years of fees in fact) and make changes to the substance (doubling it in length).  I mean to say the University administration refused to allow me to complete the 120 point Masters degree that I applied to be enrolled in because they wanted me to slave for a 3 year 360 point qualification.  I mean to say they sent my work out to be externally examined for the wrong f*cking degree.  THey set me up to fail.  That's how much they want research.  They don't want research.  They are f*cking stupid f*ckign psychopaths.  STupid f*cking idiots who cannot do their job at the most f*cking basic of level.  How hard is it to send the thesis out for the qualification the student was enrolled in?  Won't do it.  Noboyd home.  Nothing there.  NO research output.  Unless the academics take their first year students work copy paste it into one document and pass that off as research of their own.  A f*cking computer could output that.  There's nothing there.  There's nobody home.</p>

                                <p>Read the comments from the external examiners.  The overseas one wanted me to do 3 things.  1.  Define one of the terms I used.  When I was using with standard meaning.  Okay.  I can do that.  It won't take me long and you can feel like you are now part of the thesis since you forced a chanage to it you can feel like it's better for you being a part of it and since you see you in it it is more acceptable to you.  2.  Add more references for claims else remove claims that are bold claims that will be controversial to some ears.  Tone down what I am saying since most people don't accept the paradigm.  I mean to say, my thesis assumed a bunch of stuff (any thesis has to assume a bunch of stuff) and then reasons over that stuff.  But most of the critique involves people going 'nonono no no no no' to the basic assumtions.  So, they never would have let the project get up off the ground at all.  THey basically reject everything I have to say.  Of course they do.  THey are the only peopel witih anything to say.  They are the only people with speaking rights.  Cannot and will not hear anything other than themselves.  Anyway..  The external examiner had 3 main things they wanted me to do.  That could be done within 10 weeks.  So they werent' holding up the completion of the 120 point thesis and doing those three things they requested wasn't likely to make it worse, to be fair.  How about the NZ examiner?  What was their contribution towards making it better?  Making it good enough to be a research output for the qualification that I submitted it for (120 point masters research)?  What did the NZ examiner have to say about it being good enough for a 120 point 1 year research project?  Did they help make it better?  Or did they try and shut the whole thing down?</p>

                                <p>They wrote a book in response to my thesis, didn't they!  HOw many words of critique did my 1 year 120 points EFT MPhil thesis generate?  So much critique!  Almost a book in response!  That's how inspiring it was of getting someone bouncing off of what I had to say into ideas of their own.  That was the creative out-flow you might way.  Wow.  You would think, then, that having my thesis published would then provide a wonderful opportunity for the external examiner to get their own examiners comments on it published.  THen I could reply to their comments.  Then there could be a real-time debate on the issue.  Maybe other people could weigh in as well.  Isn't this supposed to be how new knowledge is created?  Right.  That must be why the University of Waikato's response to that was to refuse to get my updated thesis and comments back to external examiner.  To record that they re-enrolled me in programmed I never applied to be enrolled in (I was just supposed to keep handing over to them more and more and more and more research work so they could refuse to acknowledge any of it and call me garbage garbage rubbish rubbish stupid f*cking lazy) and record on my transcript that I fail.  I don't have the capacity to do 120 points of research in 1 year 1 EFT.  No research.  No research can be done at htat University. </p>

                                <p>How about the other universities of NZ, then?  Nobody would supervise me from Otago.  Not in Public Health and not in Philosophy. I was attempting to apply to do a 1 year research only project and nobody would have that.  None of the academic people were willing to supervise a 1 year research project.  THey couldnt' even say 'I don't have time to help you with it because I'm too busy not really doing any research myself but I won't help you -- but I will get it to externals if you submit it on this date'.  They wouldn't even do that.  No research output.  No research.  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>The Australian National University.  The adminsistration did not get my work out to externals. I don't think that any of the students had oral defences.  Not attended by externals.  I don't know that any of their students had their thesis externally examined.  It was just that some of the students were put on payroll and they passed them off as professor.  Did they have research outputs?  Not sure.  I think some of htem have research subsequently credited or attributed to their name.  Did they do it themselves?  Unclear to me.  I think that people send work to journals, don't they, then the authors are bullied into leaving so that people who can't or wont' do any research pass that work off as their own.  There is nothing there.  Nobody home.  That's why you go to morning and afternoon tea, people, so you can see if there is anybody home behind the research.  That's why you want there to be an oral defense.  So you can see if it is likely that they wrote the output.  Or whether they put them in some kind of group work environment where one person does everybody else's work for them.</p>

                                <p>Nothing there.  Nobody home.  Peter Crampton was getting all the Maaori Health money.  Right?  He was selecting the Maaori students he wanted for MBChB.  Carefully handpicked by Peter Crampton for everything it is that he values.  He was writing up publications with them, I mean to say putting their name on publications he wrote.  In Philosophy, no less.  He made it to Utilitarianism, rudimentary.  The main reason why Philosophy moved forwards from Utilitarianism (hundreds of years ago) is because most people think that scapegoating an innocent is morally wrong.  They also think that, say, killing off one to save many others, e.g., by stealing their organs, is also wrong.  But Crampton is a Utilitarian and people.  Well, he doesn't see people.  He just sees tools to be used for his own personal advantage.  That's how he gets to be head of the Maaori Medicine, of course.  Throwing however many applications away.  There is no alternative.  All of the research for him.  Do you write stuff for the NZMJ and have it peer reviewd or do they just publish every f*cking thing that you say Peter?  Is anybody allowed to write a critique or response to what it is that you have to say?  Wouldn't it be good for the Univesrity if people were to academically engage with you and have different ideas.  Then you could respond..  People could change their minds.  There could actually be an academic environment. But nono  no no no no no you indoctroniate the masses.  You tell everybody how it is.  You you you you you you you.  And the 3 or for yes-men carefully picked by you.  There's no university.  But of course, all of the money for you Peter Crampton.  So you can throw away all the applications until you have your little Nazi-Doctors picked out to socially engineer everything to be more and more and more like you.  That's a wonderful job for you!  If you are done pretending to be engaging in research then maybe you can go work for the DHB, now.  Throw away applications from nurses and doctors and so on so that only the ones on board with your vision can be employed to do anything anything anytihng you say.  There's nothing here.  Won't even allow externals to sign off on completion of 1 f*cking year of research.  Not possible to output any f*cking thing at all.  Nothing here.  nobody hoome. Allllll of the research everything for you you stupid f*cking shit.  Can't f*cking listen to anybody not-you.  Selifish f*cking prick.  Ruining everything for everyone.  Are you dead yet?  F*cking hurry up and get out of the f*cking way. </p>

                                <p>That is why they don't have lectures that are open to the public.  THey won't allow people to ask questions.  They seed a few people with questions they have given them, already, and they only take questions from them.  To conceal that the speaker actually doesn't know the topic and they are simply reading out a script that they stole from somebody else.  That's what you see when you talk to people at morning tea and so on.  The ones who can explain their work because their work is only a selection of the information and knowledge and ideas and so on that they have in their brains.  The people who you learn from when you have conversations.  And the party party party lets all get drunk and have a party and smile so pretty pretty for the camera so that all of the people want to come to the Australian National Universisty for all the right reasons.  COme and take the research and ideas from the people who will be bullied into fleeing.  Right?  Because it's sooooooo competitive.  ALl of the everything for you and your f*ckign selfish.  WHen I grow up I want to be a Sophist.  Take all the money for pretending to teach philosophy when I don't actually know anything about anything at all and there isnt' an education and training system, anyway.  Some people want to keep slaves  because the enslaved wouldn't voluntarily choose to spend time with them otherwise.  Therefore they must be enslaves.  Right.  You have to go camping and house sit.  It's importnt for career.  Yeah, right.  So... 10 years later...  Why hasn't my work gone out for external examination yet?   How long can a 3 year PhD possibly take ffs?  Have you got out your pen yet Sterelny??  WHy so f*cking slow...</p>

                                <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/opinion/300806891/inward-research-funding-model-applied-to-outward-tertiary-sector  So that's why academia is such a hostile environment where people are all 'garbage garbage garbage rubbish crap garbage' about each others  work.  So it gets to the point where you can't even state the obvious in print because everyone will just crap all over it.  Because it's soooooo competitive.  Anyone who has publication wants for everybody else to have less than they do to assert their position on the financial hierarchy.  If that means they refuse to get students work to externals examiners (if the students are researching independently from their supervisors as they are in fact supposed to be able to do) then they must be eliminated.  Why didn't the University of Waikato want research outputs, though?  I mean to say, if they were going to get money for acknowledging my research work then why didn't they acknowledge my research work? It is not about the money.  
                                </p> 


                                <p>
                                How about the Australian National University?  Why didn't they acknowledge my research work? If they get money for it then why not acknowledge it?  The Administration was supplied with a table of contents asserting that I had written a thesis of more than 100,000 words.  Why didn't they tell me to bind it so they wouuld get it out to externals since my supervisor was refusing to do his job of supervising me?  That way the externals could have told me what changes to make before they would accept it.  Instead of Sterelny who was only interested in keeping people as slaves for himself.  Party party party.  Who wants to party with Sterelny?  Who wants to house-sit his house?  Who wants to go camping?  You have to go.  It's important for your career.  You have to go and listen to everybody else give invited talks.  YOu have to tell them what you think of their talk.  Give them all your ideas.  Give them all your critique.  Help them make their work better. You have to.  It's important for your career that you go liten to them.  All eyes on them.  All eyes on them.  All eyes on them.  
                            </p>

                            <p>

                                 Why didn't Auckland want me to research psychiatry?  That would have  been a money earner for them.  Yes?  I know they say they don't value the case study kinds of things quite the way they value the randonmised double blind control trials.  But the case studies also require a lot less money to make.  Less people need to be involved in the production of.  One person can work on such things indepdently.  I don't think that this provides a full picture of what is going on.  The f*cking hostility where they really do throw studnets work away and refuse to acknowledge that studnets have completed requirements.  Refuse to allow externals to sign off on research completion.  Refuse to get students work to journals, even.  Refuse to allow studnets to function.  I mean to say they seem to be doing absolutely everything they possibly can to prevent and prohibit the output of timely quality research.  I suppose so that Chris Whelan can go blackbirding for 14 year old finance students for AUT.  Come on.  They aren't primariliy interested in research at all.  Look at the research work that I have done.  Independently externally examine it for quality.  Not 'it's all very very very very personal and we don't like your face if we rank you badly that means we are relatively higher ranked than you so we go around going rubbish rubbish rubbish pooh pooh pooh all f*cking day'. </p>

                                <p>What research output?  The first year University studnets output more research in one year than their professors do, ffs.  It's really not supposed to be that f*cking hard.  Party party party.  Who wants to have a party with the administration.  Better put on your very best party frock and do anything anything anything everything Professor Bloomfield-Umbridge does decree else he will simply take your work and pass it off as his own.  Give it away to his friends or other studnets so they can.  Bully you into leaving without getting your work to examiners.  There is nothing here.  What Universities.  What research.  There is nothing here.</p>

                                <p>I must have missed the ANU Phd Thesis defences...  I don't recall a single one...  Not a single one...  I don't recally anybody needing to defend their PhD thesis submission.  I do remember Brett Calcott and Ben Jeffares being grilled pretty hard by various people for their 6 monthly review.  To the point where Kim Sterelny started taking over answering questions that were thrown to them and handling their defence for them.  But those were not thesis defences at the end of their project.  I don't remember a single scheduled event which involved anybody's thesis defence..  At the end of their project.  That they were supposed to handle (and not their supervisor)  Hur.  I guess they just didn't get a bunch of theses out for external examination at all and then gave a bunch of people PhD's for no obvious or appreciable reason...  Huh.  I remember Nick Southwood saying he did everything his supervisor told him to do (as did I) and his thesis was accepted by external examiners without them requiring a single change.  I wonder if that is because it never went out for external examination at all.   Oh wells.  At least I don't need to tell them my ideas over morning or afternoon tea anymore.  Over drinks or dinner.  What's that John Matthewson, it doesn't mattter who has the ideas.  It only matters who is credited as  having them.</p>

                                <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/131238461/auckland-university-tells-staff-to-use-gptzero-to-detect-chatbot-cheats  Lol.  Chat GTP is probably what the University is using to grade the students work.  Chat GTP is likely writing the grading comments on the student work.  Insofar as they identify the students with capacity to do the work...  They enslave them and steal their outputs and pass them off as the work of the Rt Honorable Dr Ashley Bloomdfield-Umbridge PhD MD etc etc etc.  Of course.  So he can arrange a weekend workshop compulsory for all the 14 year old Vietnamese finance students enrolled in AUT, no doubt.  So they can learn about how they must do anything anything anything anything anything else they will never be acknowledged as having completed their qualification.  Must have!!!!</p>

                                <p>Q:  How do I genoocide an entire people?  A:  One by one  by one by one.  It's all very very very very particular.  And very very very very personal.  The individuals must pay the costs involved in holding the responsible individuals to account. Nobody can bear the costs.  It's just too expensive.  Far too costly.  Just curl up and die, everybody.  All voluntary-like.  Just hand Chris Hipkins all your stuff.  He has to pay various people to be Minster of This, That, and the Other Thing now.  It's all far too costly...  </p>

                                <p>Of course NZ could never go to war with China.  I mean, what would Jacinda wear??</p>

                                <p>Let her wear USA military uniform!  Oh.  Those are made in China.  Guess that USA can't go to war with China, then, they'd have nothing to wear.  The enemy could dress their own soldiors in USA military attire and eliminate them from within all stealth-like.  Maybe Jacinda could wear tar on her heels then.. No?  She could wear Pavlova?  What's that?  That's Australian and not NZ? Well, then, she could wear nothing then.  Now she understands the nature of choice.  Great.  Well done.  All the voluntary choosings for her, then.  All the voluntary choosings for her.  Great job!  WEll done!!</p>

                                <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/opinion/131256388/damien-grant-the-world-moves-on-but-a-teddy-bear-reminds-us-of-what-should-never-be-forgotten  Aw.  Silly silly sausage.  It's just one individual and another individual and another individual.  It's all very very particular and very very personal against particular and personal indiviudals.  There's no mass genocide.  Just very very very particular scapegoating against very very very particular individuals.  First they came for the Jews.  But I wasn't Jewish.  They were only coming for the Jewish individuals.  One at a time.  All very very particular and very very very very targeted like.  Not a problem for me.  I don't see a problem.  THey are only coming for not-me.  Then they came for the people with disability.  Not en masse.  Just all very very very particular and very very very very personal.  All very particular and very very very personal against..  Countless individuals, really.  Quarter of the population?  Eliminated one by one?  Nobody saw it coming!  All very very very very particular and very very very very personal...</p>

                                <p>There isn't any Psychiatry in Australasia because the wrong people won WWII in this region.  Psychiatry was developed by Freud and Jung and so on to actually try and help people who had trauma from war.  To help them recover.  But we don't have psychiatry in these parts because the government is more interested in continuing on with the WWII types of atrocities.  I mean to say they involuntarily detain people in conditions of torture in the name of psychiatry and they employ known pedophiles and rapists and date rape drug people and so on into psychiatary.  That seems to be what the government in this region thinks the function of psychiatry is.  To weaken and sicken the people etc.  Comparably to the rest of 'medicine'. of course.  It was the Nazi doctors 'doctors' who wanted to see what would happen when they drowned people and gassed them and so on.  Just to see what would happen in the name of important scientific research, of course.  Helping me helpling me helping me help myself to you.  I wonder what the process for being a Nazi Doctor was?  How they picked out who got to be a Nazi Doctor?  Did they prioritise the children of the Nazi Doctors?  Probably...  Probably thinking they would be most likely to continue on the crimes of their parents...</p>

                                <p>Hurry up and breed more slaves everybody!  The old ones woke up to their position and then it was time for them to be put out of their misery.  But first they need to breed us replacements so that we have all the slaves we need.  Theres nothing here.</p>

                                <p>I do remember having a meeting with Kim Sterelny around 6 months into my PhD candidature.  He said Paul Griffiths was coming into town and I was to go have a drink with them both.  I said I couldn't afford it.  He said it was important to my career.  That he would buy me drinks, then.  Wow.  Australian National University.  The Premier Research Institution of Australasia.  When was my PhD work supposed to go out to external examiners? 2009?  What happened?  Various of my written work was presented at conferneces and workshops and the like. So that other people could take it for themselves and pass it off as their own.  So that I could be bullied into leaving the University (sorry the 'University') without my work going to external examiners.  So that f*cking* retards like Sterelny can have all the research funding for themselves so they can pay for their students to go out drinking with them since it's soooo important to their students careers to go drinking with their supervisor and their supervisors friends on demand.  Worst 'University' ever.  I'm soooooo sad I don't have to have morning tea and afternoon tea with them anymore.  I don't have to go to school in order to eat my lunch.  Awwwww.  I miss my frienemies soooooooo muuuuuuuch.  Couldn't show me the most basic of respect by getting my work out to externals in a timely fashion so it could be externally examined on it's academic merits.  They were actually employed to help me.  But, apparently, it's soooooo competitive.  So they just take everything from me and bully me into fleeing.  Because that's how f*cking stupid they are.  One can only suppose.  Sterelny would say that it's been overtaken by psychopaths.  His selfish genes etc etc.  State of socio-biology since the 60's.  The way things were round the end of WWII before people were held to account for war crimes and atrocities.  Nobody was held to account in this region and the atrocities never stopped.  There is not a functioning administration in these parts.  No health system, education system, judiciary.  Social engineering experiment of 'brave new world' proportions where the aim is to breed and keep an underclass of slaves who will do all of the work so that the elite we happy few slavers can take all the credit and so on for themselves.  Until they get sick, of course.  At which point 'awwwww' the vultures swoop in and thats the end of their nasty bruitish and short little lives.  Because it's sooooooo competitive and when you see vulnerable targets they are simply there for the taking.</p>

                                <p>*  I call him a 'f*cking retard' because I'm apeing his manner or style of interaction.  It's all 'f*cked the dog' this and 'screwed the pooch' that and it's all apparently very very amusing and very very funny.  The complete and utter lack of professionalism.</p>

                                <p>I don't see any people.  Do you?  I see 'people' behaving as animals.  Trying to be animals.  Trying to say that they don't see any people either.  Just animals animals everywhere.  Animals and robots.  Right.  Zombies.  Nobody home.  Doesn't matter what you do to them.  Eat them for food.  Turn them off at the wall.  Lights out.  Night night.  Bye buy.  Repeatedly shoot them.  Just so we understand the function of 'medicine'.</p>

                                <p>I suppose that Sterelny's position as journal editor meant that he got sent quite a lot of articles that had been written.  Then the idea is to hold up the articles that you get from vulnerable people (e.g., students) and reattribute authorship to others.  Delay publication until the student is bullied into fleeing the field entirely and then you can reattribute authorship to others.  Take it for yourself, give it to your favorite studnets (the ones who will be totally dependent on you) and so on.  Of course Penn has the journal, now.  Because Penn is supposed to have research outputs so they want to attribtue the work to their own students so that studnets want to go to Penn so they can have research outputs.  I suppose the idea is that you pay the 'University' enough money and they will find some thesis or other to attribute to you.  An article or two.  Then they can put you on payroll at some 'University' where you only need take the work of your students and hand it over, in turn, so that others can pick out the ones with merit so you know that those students in particular need to be bullied into fleeing else need to be exterminated or whatever.  So that other people can keep their stufff.  Then, once you've got a whole lot of 'dead wood' (they call it) with tenured positions on payroll they can just cry cry cry about how they don't have any academic freedom.  It wasn't that they were hand-picked for the positions precisely  because they themselves lacked the willingness or ability to do any actual academic research, it is that they don't have the academic freedom to actually do any.  Yeah, right.  Whatever.  I don't think that most of them wrote their own thesis.  Know how you tell?  Because they won't allow their studnets to write their own thesis and they won't allow their students to get their thesis out to external examiners.  Theres really nothing there..  Nobody home..</p>

                                <p>There isn't any scientific research.  It's just an excuse for atrocities.  Want to observe people dying premature and preventable deaths?  You say that we don't know that it's preventable, yet, so we need to observe things for the next few generations before we would be able to have some idea...  'Scientific research' is the excuse for atrocties.  The government is the major funder.  THey are particularly keen on identifying as many vulnerable people as they can.  Creating as many vulnerable people as they can.  Targeting as many people as they can.  Weakening and sickening and so on.  Because, you konw, it's all sooooo competitive.  Gnawing each others arms off.  Kuru.</p>

                                <p>NZ has insisted on massively over-prescribing old generation anti-psychotic medications since...  Since they were invented.  Everybody knows that that is likely to result in long-term side affects of neurodegeneration.  Because the medications are neuro-toxic.  Tardive dyskinesias.  Movement disorders.  Parkinsonian-like symptoms.  That's precisely why they overprescribe them.  Intentionally.  Then you tell people that the reason they need to take the medication is because of the Parkinson-like symptoms and the medication basically kills them.  You can do that with the cancer drugs, too.  Neuro-toxic, they are.  Peripheral neuropathy.  Paralysis.  Of course, if people won't take them voluntarily then you can get  court order.  The courts will find in favor of awarding custody to the state.  Quickly quickly quickly, even,  before one of the sides is able to call witnesses, even.  Quickly quickly quickly.  You need to quickly quickly award custody to the state.  The state which hasn't even payed out for the last lot of atrocities, yet!  Too busy moving quickly quickly quickly on the new ones.</p>

                                <p>Urgency urgency it's an emergency.  All that need to be hurried through without public consultation, without the public being informed.  Precisely because they know the public wouldn't like or want that.  All the teenage children of the administration expediated into Medical 'training' programmes because they think they are most likely to continue on the atrocities of their parents  (or at least be quiet about them) while they pretend to be too stupid to process or progress anything else.  Too stupid to output a judgment 4 months post-hearing.  Too stupid to hold off enrolling the children of the administration until they turn 20 where the statue says they are eligible in fact.  Too busy using their discretion, discretion they believe they have, to assert themselves as arbitrary leaders of the prison detention camps up and down the land that is Australasia.  The ANU isn't a university because universities don't keep slaves.  What do you call it when they won't get their studnets work out to external examiners in a timely fashion?  I wonder...  Did any of the studnets work actually go out to external examiners?  Or did the University simply give some kids their qualifications without their work ever having gone out?  I mean to say..  Who externally examined Nick Southwood's PhD thesis?  Who were the external examiners who were not involved in the production of the thesis, at all?  Who externally examined Racheal Brown's PhD thesis.  Did they ever go out for external examination at all?  Or did they just decide in-house to award them the qualifications regardless?  How about Holly Lawford-Smith?  Who externally examined her PhD?  Did any of these studnets have an oral defence?  So that people (members of the public and university academics) could question them about the thesis?  To make sure that they understood the content of it.  I mean to say, that's the mechanism for ensuring that PhD students actually wrote their own work?  Right?  When were the oral defences?</p>

                                <p>What University?  There's nothing there...</p>

                                <p>Why didn't my work go out to external examiners?  Why won't they send it out now?  Why won't they send it out?  Is it because they think external examiners would fail me?  That can't be why they won't send it out.  They are failing me by not sending it out.  They won't send it out, therefore, because they believe that the externals would pass it.  Would sign me off.  They won't send it out because there never will be a job for me.  All the jobs for them.  The only game in town.  Nobody else was eligible to apply.  Nobody else had a PhD.  All of the everything for those happy few.  Oh so happy.  So they can tell their studnets they are required to go out drinking with them -- their career depends on it.  THey are required to house sit for them.  They are required to go camping with them.  They are required to listen to them pretending to be impressed an in rapt awe.  They are supposed to suck up to them and pander to them.  Hang out with them on demand.  What University?  There isn't anything there.  They won't get the work out to external examiners.  Sterelny says he doesn't acknowledge anything that was done more than 5 years ago.  I suppose that means that he thinks he gets to keep anything he has forced to be abandoned.  If the author isn't credited with it within 5 years then it is regarded abandonware and they reatrribute authorship of it.  Well, then, what has he done in the last 5 years?  If he doesn't think that anybody should be credited or acknowledged for anything they produced more than 5 years ago why is he still on payroll?  Studnets have stopped sending him their work now, right?  He's not editor of a journal anymore.  Does he 'definate no' publications and then pass them off as his own 5 years later?  What a f*cking scummy hoax of a f*cking scummy scam.  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>___________</p>

                                <p>How bad do the weather bombs need to be before...  People turn to the likes of Chris Hipkins for comfort?  Before...  All eyes on me!  All eyes on me!  All eyes on me!!!  Important public service announcement!  All eyes on me!  It was not very long ago that the government was considering using the army?  Was it?  To accompany politicians when they went political campaigning.  Because they were just starting to realise how the consequence of declaring war on the people (ordering people to give up jobs and ordering people to close up their businesses because of government mandates around vaccine and people being detained in theier own homes) meant that the people were starting to take up arms against the government.  The governmetn was starting to realise that they needed military to stop people asking questions of them publically that they didn't want to answer and so on...</p>

                                <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/484408/cyclone-gabrielle-areas-of-hawke-s-bay-left-a-disaster-zone-i-d-call-it-an-apocalypse-basically  Civil defence.  That's a good idea, Chris.  You need to pay a mercenary army of 'civil defenders' to accompany you on your campaign trail.  It's less of a security threat for you if you weather bomb them first.  Right?  They can start to approximate more of a third world bargaining position where they can cry cry cry cry cry to you for supplication.  That would make you feel like a really big man.  Right?  Godly.  Relative to them.  That's the aim the goal the purpose or the point?  Right?  Minister of all the things.  </p>

                                <p>Other people have portfolios, now.  Now that the Minsiter of Everything is on the campaign trail that means his attention is on that so other people have portfolios now.  I stil haven't heard back from the recently appointed 'Minister for Courts'.  I received a response that the 'Minister of Justice' has delegegated to the 'Minister for Courts'.  What are the expectations on judgment delivery?  Timliness.  What are the expectations?  If they aren't able to deliver judgments to a timeframe...  What are they doing on payroll?  Wah wah wah apparently they have been off on holiday and they have  been sick.  Aw.  Poor them.  Maybe if they need time off sick they could go onto Supported Living Payments for the time off sick they need and they could pay someone willing and or able to do their work in a timely fashion to do the things that need to be done to a timeframe.  What's that?  They were only appointed because they were corrupt.  Huh.  Oh yeah, that's right.  Because there is nothing here.  The Ministry of Injustice was it?  The prevention and prohibition of courts?  What justices?  </p>

                                <p>The people are hierarchical and competitive.  They don't believe in equality.  That people are equal (worthy of equal consideration of their interests).  They will pretend not to understand.  The way they pretend not to understand the most basic of morality.  Might is right.  The aim of life is to get as high up the social hierarchy as you can.  Social hierarchy is about power.  You assert your interests ahead of or before other people's equal interest.  You have the power to ignore and disregard their interest and you get what you want.  That's the aim or the goal of life.  To become God.  All powerful.  To have everything go ones own way.  To not have to pay any heed at all to anything other than yourself.  So interacting with people is all this...  Postural...  All this posturing.  As people puff themselves up and strut about trying to persuae the other that they are bigger than them and if it comes to conflict between interests they will have their own asserted at the expense of everyone else.  Does that sound or seem like someone you want to be close to?  Spend time with?  WOuld you want to have a baby with something like that?  So they can eat it if they get hungry, one can only suppose...  There's nothing here..</p>

                                <p>We don't have 'civil servants' in the government.  The government enslaves the people.  The government does not serve the people.  Not even trying.  No such thing as the government working for social development.  Doesnt' matter what any of the laws are because they will not appoint judges via proper process to ensure they are upheld.  They won'tn judge in accordance with the law.  There's nothing here.  Is it that htey don't have basic reading comprehension or is it that they are corrupt?  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>It's soooooooo competitive.  Medicine.  It's soooooo competitive.  All the applicaitons that need to be thrown away.  So that Dr Leeks can be positioned into place...  For all the good work that he can do...  And various people like him.  I mean it isn't like he was doing anything so very different from what everybody else is doing in the name of psychiatry.  Right?  He wasn't doing anything worse or different from what the other psychiatrists were doing.  They were specially chosen specially handpicked for psychiatry for all the qualities that were valued for that.  I mean to say it's hard to find people like Dr Leeks.  Not just anybody could do it.  I couldn't.  I couldn't treat people like that.  That's howcome I'm not competitive or not really a competitor for psychiatry.  Apparently.  I don't have it in me.  Professor Glue, on the other hand.  Drugging the teenagers and not keeping accurate medical records or charts.  To help them feel better about communal sleeping on Marae, was it?  There's nothing here...  Not even the most basic hint of 'try'.</p>

                                <p>Getting close to 4 months, now, and the Social Security Appeals Authority (SSAA) still has not released a judgment on Roe v Ministry of Social Development.  See, what happens, in NZ, is that the Government refuses to supply applications to enrol, refuses to acknowledge progression of training (e.g., by refusing to send theses that have been submitted for examination out to be examined for the qualification the studnet applied to be enrolled in) refuses to graduate all (and only) students who have completed requirements..  Keeps them on 'Supported Living Payment' rather than paying wages because it refuses to acknolwedge it's on training and qualifications...  Then, if you complain about it (and things like it such as them keeping false enrolment records recording that you have been enrolled in various programmes that you never applied to be enrolled in) the courts will...  Well, pull judges out of retirement to hear the cases.  Because that's how judge appointment works.  That's the recrutiment and employment process for judges, now.  So they can make up evidence (assert they have evidence that they actually don't have, refuse to acknowledge that they have evidence that they were actually supplied with).  SO they can ignore half the laws.  So they can declare that they don't see anything wrong with the Universities doing anything they want.  Selecting students for whatever arbitrary reasons they want.  Giving or withholding graduation for whatver arbitrary reasons they want.  In fact, the courts don't need to accept filings either.  Didn't you know?  They can just throw the filings away.  They can simply refuse to schedule hearing dates.  THey can simply refuse to supply written judgments on cases they have heard.  If htey don't want to write a written judgment (where they make false claims about evidence, where they intentionally mischaracterise the case, where they refuse to fin din the interests of justice..  What are you going to do about it?  You and whose army?  There's nothing here...  The Court of Appeal is refusing to hear cases.  The Supreme Court orders thousands of dollars against so that it can assert that it doesn't have any conception at all of what is in the public interest and the fucntion in NZ of the supreme court is to tell individuals that it's all very very particular and very very personal about them.  THey are personally and individually singled out for particularly having a very very particular treatment all very particular against them.  ANd that this kind of scapegoating (that occurs over and over and over nd over) is all perfectly acceptable.  It isnt' the function of the court to put an end to scapegoating and the like.  Come on.  The entire point of the prison camp detention facility of Australasia is to put some of the bullies in charge of the others.  Let them compete each other to death.  Squabble and squawk amongst themselves.  Land of criminal degenerates.  No satellites.  No indepdent vaccine discovery.  There's nothing there.  It's soooooooo competitive.  People with capacity and dwillingness cannot function.  Exterminated.  Not what we value.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/131240062/three-international-campaigns-to-recruit-nurses-sees-just-32-staff-hired  They are not trying, at all.  They claim to receive 'expressions of interest' and most of those are thrown away.  They are simply thrown away in some 'pre-selection phase'.  That's how hard we are trying to fill the positions.  We are refusing to allow people to apply to work those jobs.  We are throwing their 'pre-applications' away.  How much money do we make when people pre-apply and so on and so forth?  How much money do we make off or from that process?  People have to apply for a visa to move to NZ to work that job.  How much does the visa application process cost?  How much money do they collect from people applying for visa as part of this process?  Applying for registration costs money.  How much money do they collect from people applying for registration?  How much money do they make?  We aren't told how much money we spend on the marketing and the advertising and how many people on hundreds of thousands per year to throw away pre-applications and to delay visa processing.  I don't know how much of an 'incentivisation' or 'bribe' or whatever you want to call it needs to accompany a pre-application or an application or whatever.  How much extra money needs to be paid on the off chance that they might not throw your application or your pre-application away.  How do they actually and truly decide which people to hire?  Is it actually the case that we see who has  been wrongful deathbringing and so on and hire those who foreign countries are conccerned will have public outcry against their atrocities only?  Is that actually NZs role on the world stage?  A prison camp or detention camp (without a trial) for all the garbage of the world?  Is that actually what we aim or aspire or desire or actually are?</p>

                                <p>I mean, we will not train a workforce.  We throw the preapplications away.  We throw the applications away.  We say that people fail aspects of their training when we simply make all these demands on them to do things like unauthorised cervical examinations and drinking and so on and so on.  Then we don't actually process their work on it's academic merits.  We don't actually care for the most basic level of professionalism.  That's not what we are selecting for.  We seem to be selecting for the incompetent.  Those unwilling or unable or both to do the actual job.  We will not train a workforce.  We will not allow internationl community to sign off on completion of training.  Will not graduate students.  Will not publicaly advertise jobs.  Won't employ them. There is nothing here.</p>

                                <p>The scummy scam is that you pay the government and they record levels of debt against your name only.  THey put you to 'work' as an unpaid volunteer.  You pay the university for your 'work experience' or your 'work placement' and then you can play doctors and nurses or university academic or whatever it is just so long as you pay them you pay them you pay them you pay them.  They won't pay anybody to work those jobs.  They will pay people to be part of the managment and administration scummy scam only.  Keepign various people enslaved doing the job for no pay until it is time for them to go away.  What social services?  There's nothing here.  THey aren't trying at all.</p>

                                <p>They surely are not so f*cking stupid as to be throwing so much money away on advertising and readvertising and readvertising and marketing.  That isn't plausible.  How much money do they make off of people applying for visas and so on.  Processing fees.  Application fees.  Applying to register?  How much moeny do they make?  I suppose the real scummy scam is that they will tell people that they aren't 'eligible' (their favorate garbage output thing to say) then they will say that they will consider them eligible if only they would...  Now there are various tihngs they can say.  If they housesit for them.  If they look after their cats.  Maybe they will if they party with them enough.  If they can look like they enjoy it.  Maybe they will if they agree to enrol in this, that, or the other course or programme of study.  They won't acknowledge the foreign nursing or doctor qualifications, you see.  THey will have to do this or that course in New Zealand paying international student fees and complete that course before they are eligible.  So, really, the foreign marketing campaign for qualified nurses and the like is actually just more blackbirding for student slaves.  Who will be put to work doing the job while they pay international student fees to the 'universities'.  And, of course, that scummy scam can run for as long as the visas are renewed.  I'm sorry, as long as the government collect up more and more money for them to keep their visas current or live.  Then they can be involuntariliy detained in the psych ward in conditions of  torture, else imprisoned and told they can plead guilty and be out in a year else don't plead guilty and wait 2 years for a hearing date.  Else they can get the f*ck out.  Just run away.  Because there is nothing here.</p>

                                <p>We are supposed to believe that some 60 year old in the UK forged her University of Auckland qualification and actually she shouldn't have been employed by the NHS, at all.  Does that seem plausible or likely at all?  I suppose the case is actually that the NHS never would have hired her in the first place is they hadn't have known that she was a fraud.  I mean to say, she was practicing as a psychiatrist.  So that means she passed exams to be accepted to train to be a specialist psychiatrist.  Whether or not the University of Auckland says they graduated her from MBChB or not she passed graduate level exams for entry to psychiatry specialist training.  They are tests of knowledge?  Are they?  What is their function?  THen she did the specialist psychiatry training in England.  Did she?  What hospital?  ANd she was found competent every step of the way.  Was she?  And she then recieved her specialist psychiatry accredittion and qualification and so on.  All of that happened when she was in England.  SO...  Whether or not she completed MBChB..  Is a bit like asking whether she completed Form 5 English.  I mean, who the f*ck cares if you completed Form 5 English if you get your PhD in to the University and if they had have got it to externals and the externals would have signed off that it was in fact good enough for the qualification you applied for and were working on...  Who f*cking cares.</p>

                                <p>But there really isnt' anything here.  THey only would have hired her on the condition that they could end her any time you like.  I mean to say that will be the next step with implants (we seem to be doing it already) we press the 'destruct' button on various people.  Like me.  Right?  Hey..  Let's just not get her thesis out to external examiners.   Haha.  What's she going to do about it.  It's sooooo competitive and various people are on payroll and there is no alternative so the people on payroll just throw all the pre-applications away throw the applications away throw the theses away.  Throw the students work away.  Throw the students away.  There's nothign there.  The win.  They are the head of the nothing.  There's nothing there.  What hospital?</p>

                                <p>Why does NZ need a 'temporary morgue' for 8 bodies?  Get out there people!  See how many you can drown in the name of 'flood', now.  It's soooo comeptitive.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>I suppose this website documents corruption in Australasia.  The decision that current or present leaders have made to govern as Gods over detention, prison, or slave camps.  There doesn't appear to  be a public health system, education system, judiciary.  Only people on payroll to prevent and prohibit and obstruct and confuse and delay.  They mostly seem to be picked out all special on the basis of nepotism, where they are especially keen to scurry through the particularly stupid or morally bankrupt to lord above everybody else.  They aren't publically advertising training places or employment opportunities, they aren't engaging in merit based selection, they are corrupt, through and through.  They seem to think that their children are most likely to cover up their crimes and that seems to be what they have devoted themselves to and what they choose for their legacy to be. </p>

                                <p>The Australian constitution says very specifically indeed that New Zealand is a State of the Federation of Australia.  But wah wah wah there are various reasons why Australia does not have to uphold it's own constitution.  The people of NZ did not consent, apparently.  But they didn't even supply voting papers to NZers to be able to say what the people of NZ did or did not consent to.  There is a process for changing the constitution if they want to grant independence to NZ and that process has not been followed.  But the rules don't apply to Australia.  Ruled by a bunch of Gods who do anything anything anything they want.  Hey, let's treat NZ as an off-shore detention camp new manus island for Australia.  What is NZ going to do about it?  </p>

                                <p>The Australian Federal Court will not process filings.  They say they don't have jurisdiction.  Picked out for their reading comprehension, were they?</p>

                                <p>They aren't allowing studnets work to be externally examined on the basis of it's academic merits.  They won't get the work out to external examiners.  Apparently they are allowed to make decisions on entirely personal grounds that they aren't accountable for because it's all personal and very very particular problems that they have with however many individuals.  See, what justice is or means in these parts is finding people you think are 'vulnerable' (people who aren't going to raise an army against you) and scapegoating them for everything.  That's what justice is or means in these lands.  Which is just to say that there is no justice at all.  There is nothing here.  No education.  THey just pick out the children of the administration and give them all the money and titles and honors and awards.  They won't even get others work out to externals.  They steal it for themselves and claim to be the author of it else they refuse to acknowledge the output of others because of their own stupidity and their own f*cking selfishness.  All of the money and the titles and the honors and the awards so that they can keep slaves and steal everything from everybody else.  There is nothing here.</p>

                                <p>Private business can't function because the government steals everything.  Orders them to be shut down.  Diverts resources for themselves.  Is not fair in external contracts.  The judiciary can't or won't function.  The law schools are not being fair on how they process applications.  They are not allowing progression through training to be acknowledged.  They aren't graduating all and only those who are meeting internationally accepted standards.  They give the paid positions to the kids of the administration.  They pick out the incompetent and or malevolent to ensure that their position as Gods over the slaves is ensured.  There is nothing here.</p>

                                <p>There aren't any education and training systems.  They can't do it.  They won't do it.  What is the research output of the English or Philosophy Departments in NZ Universities?  In Australian?  THeir primary activity is supposed to be research.  Their first year studnets output more research work than they do.  Each and every year.  There is nothing here.  Nobody home.  Hey, let's write a report about how the Government is morally obliged to identify vulnerable children and take them and give them to Dr Leeks.  The only person allowed to do psychiatry in these parts.  Carefully selected for all the qualities that we value.  Selected to train a new workforce of psychatrists.  See how many children he could take out eliminate remove so that all of the money and titles and honors and awards could go to him so we can build a monument to him because what it is that we most value in Australia is the likes of him.  Clearly.  I mean, they wouldn't process an application to enrol from anybody else.  THey wouldn't acknoweldge progression through training.  No sign off.  No paid employment.  All and only the likes of Dr Leeks need apply.  Most valuable employee.  Let's move him around and see how many regions he can get people understanding everything it is that we value in this region.  Everything we want the world to be.  The exploitation of vulnerable people.  Using and abusing them and maiming and harming and destroying.  The only game in town.</p>

                                <p>The courts won't process or progress legal filings.  The judges were picked out precisely because they were unwilling and unable to do their jobs.  I mean, what are we supposed to think at this point?  Can't do it.  Won't do it.  All of the money for them.  All of the money for all of the people who can't and won't do the job for which they are paid.  All of the money for Andrea Howard to throw applications away.  All of the money for Peter Crampton in the name of equity.  All of the equity positions for Peter Crampton.  Since he moved here from England when he was, like, 12.  Clearly to be head of the Maaori.  Picked out all special to be head of the Maaori at such a young age.  All of the equity for him. </p>

                                <p>Corruption.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>____</p>


                                <p>The transcript of the High Court Proceedings for Roe v University of Otago would show that  the Justice kept insisting that I was wrongly claiming to be 'entitled'
                                to  be enrolled in MBChB.  I stated very clearly to the Justice in both my written submissions and in person before the court that I did not maintain that I was 'entitled' to be enrolled.  Rather, I maintained that I was 'eligible' to be enrolled.  THe Judge refused to hear that.  The Judge insisted on mischaracterising the issue that I  brought before the courts in his written judgment as my having a false sense of entitlement.  At which point...  What?  The only sensible question to ask is:  'Is the judge stupid?  What is wrong with him?  He can't repeat back what I just said (over and over and over ) both in writing and in person.  Is he f*cking stupid?  No?  Then what is his f*cking problem?  What is going on here?                       </p>

                                <p>What is the difference?  The difference is that the Education and Training Act states quite clearly that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are 'eligible' to be enrolled in the programme that they have applied for.  The University of Otago was refusing to supply applications to at least some domestic adults (e.g., myself) on grounds that the University deemed them to be 'ineligible'.  But they do not have the statutory power to deem domestic adults 'ineligible'.  The University is supposed to follow the statute.  And they refuse.  The Judge is supposed to order or instruct the Univerity to follow the statute else remove the responsible parties from office if they are unwilling and / or unable to follow the statute.  But they will not.  </p>

                                <p>They are not just refusing to supply applications to enrol (on grounds that they have deemed people to be 'ineligible' who are in fact eligible by statutory law of New Zealand).  They are also throwing away applications that they have received from eligible applicants BEFORE they have considered the application on it's academic merits.  Peter Crampton, Andrea Howard, Bryan Hyland, and John Reynolds have all been involved in using their positions such as chair of the Medical Admissions Committee, administrator, Deputy Chair, to throwing away applications to MBChB before the application has even  been placed before the Medical Admisions Committee for the application to be considered on it's academic merits alongside the other applications that have been received.  They say they can throw them away instead of considering them on their academic merits because they have deemed the applicant 'ineligible' but they do not have the power to proclaim that.  They are acting ultra vires refusing to supply applications to applicants who are eligible by statute, refusing to process applicatons on the basis of their academic merits.  </p>

                                <p>It would be interesting to know if all of these individuals have at least one child, each, who was accepted in MBChB at one of the Univerties in Australasia.  I mean to say, if administration is so corrupt as to removing applicants from the applicant pool so as to ensure or improve the selection of other candidates.  A sort of reverse equity using public resources (medical training places) for private advantage.  Because only their children are 'entitled'.  Sometimes people give the places to the children of administration outright.  For example, the daughter of the VC of the Univeristy of Queensland knew that his daughter was offered a place in MBChB in QUeensland even though she was not rank order scored  high enough for a place on the basis of her academic merits.  Other times they send their children to a different University.  Swap them so it is less obvious to everyone how corrupt they are.</p>

                                <p>So Justice Gendal was...  Pulled out of retirement, was he?  To refuse to judge the case I actually brought before him...  To write up a straw-man case and accuse me of bringing something unwinnable before the courts.  Costs are awarded against me because I was wrong that I was entitled.  I never claimed to be entitled.  I claimed to be eligible.  Roe v University of Auckland established that I was eligible by statute.  It's not that f*cking hard to see the problem, here.  Corruption with the courts, now, too.  </p>

                                <p>___</p>

                                <p>People are saying that I did not meet ANY of the requirements for enrolment in MBChB with the University of Auckland.  That is false.  I met ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS.  That is what makes their refusal to supply me with an offer of enrolment wrong.  Do you follow?  Can you hear that?</p>

                                <p>What were the requirements?  First, you had to be eligible to be enrolled in that progarmme.  Was I eligible?  Yes.  I was.  In virtue of my being a domestic adult who has attained the age of 20 years.  The Education and Training Act states that I am eligible to be enrolled in the progarmme I have applied to.</p>

                                <p>Does that mean that the University of Auckland is required to enrol ALL of the domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years?  Since they are ALL eligible, by statute?  The answer to that is, no.  There can be reasons why the enrolment numbers need to be limited.  This is something that can be questioned.  This is not something I have chosen to question. I accept the cap on the number of studnets to be enrolled for the purposes of this discussion.  </p>

                                <p>So, then, if there are more eligible applicants than there are available places in the programme how are they to decide who to enrol?</p>

                                <p>The University of Auckland has published a selection algorithm that they state they will use in order to rank order score candidates who are eligible, for hte purposes of selection.  This algorithm involves UMAT / UCAT score, interview score, and GPA.  There are specific instructions on how they are to calculate the GPA.  It is to come from the last 2 years of graded full time study (at least 120 points in 1 year for full time study) including summer school papers when those summer school papers are above stage 1.</p>

                                <p>The Education and Training Act allows that candidates may be preferred on equity grounds.  That means to say a studnet who scores lower may be offered a place even though they didn't score well enough, in the interests of promoting equity.  Equity grounds, for Auckland, include disability.  That means to say a candidate with disability may be selected even though their rank order score isn't quite high enough.  This is for the purpose of ensuring that the population of medical students and future doctors is more diverse than it would be otherwise.  I did not ask for equity consideration to be applied to my application.  That means to say, I asked Auckland to rank order score me for selection the same as everybody else.  I did not ask for them to give me special promotion on equity grounds. </p>

                                <p>So..  What was my rank order score then?  Was it high enoguh for offer of place?  If there are 250 places, for example, then was my rank order score somewhere between 1 and 250?  Or, if 50 candidates were promoted on equity grounds then was my rank order score between 1 and 200?  Do you follow?</p>

                                <p>What was my rank order score for selection in 2019 and again in 2020?  Was it high enough for the University of Auckland to be required to enrol me (given how many equity candidates they admitted in that year)?</p>

                                <p>Do you follow?</p>

                                <p>The answer to that question is...  The University told me that it was not high enough for offer of place.  I said I did not believe them and asked for evidence of how they chose to calculate my rank order score.  They supplied me with information as to how they calculated it.  HOw they calcualted it was different from how their algorithm told them to calculate it.  For example, they used one part time year where I did less than 120 points in one year. But their algorithm states they will use full time years, only, where the student did at least 120 points in that year.  They also did not calculate the best 120 points in a year where I did excess of 120 points.  Instead, they calculated my worst 120 points.  But I did a summer school paper in that year that was above stage 1 specifically for the purposes of bringing up my full time GPA.  IN response to my providing this information to the University (along with my own calculation where my GPA, according to their algorithm was 8.6) the University said that my GPA did not matter because they proclaimed me to be ineligible to have applied.  But, Justice Fitzgerald pointed out, they do not have authority to say that domestic adults are not eligible to apply.  The statute proclaims domestic adults to be eligible. </p>

                                <p>So, why didn't Justice Fitzgerald proclaim that they way they handled my application to enrol in MBChB was ultra virae?  That was what I asked her to do.  They did not have the power to decline my application on grounds of 'ineligiblity' because the Edcuation and Training Act prohibits them from doing that.  Rather, they were required to process my application on it's merits.  Same as everybody else.  I didn't ask for equity consideration.  Why didn't Justice Fitzgerald order or instruct them to go away and calculate it properly, according to their selection algorithm, since I was eligible in fact?  She accepted what I said (their lawyers accepted what I said if you listen to the transcript Bell Gully lawyers accepted my GPA for purposes of selection was 8.6).  But the University of Auckland refused to state what my correctly calculted rnk order score was.  And Justice Fitzgerald failed to require them to go away and deliver a judgement on my rank order score that was produced in accordance with their selection algorithm that they published for the purposes of their own accountability.</p>

                                <p>So, that's Otago and Auckland.  Not being fair, at all, in how they go about selecting what studnets to enrol in MBChB.  The worst of it is that they aren't sort of sneakily doing it surreptitiously...  Rather, they are choosing to use taxpayers dollars to hire major firms and senior counsel for themselves to defend their entitltement, they believe they have, to pick nd choose whatever studnets they want to enrol for whatever arbitrary reasons they have.  If you look at what students they choose to enrol in fact, I am not too sure what you see.  The children of the administration?  That seems most likely in fact.  They tell people that they aren't good enough, particularly that they aren't academically strong enough, but they are not making decisions on the basis of applicants academic strengths at all.  They are not even trying to be fair.  They choose to hire lawyers to defend their sense of entitltment.</p>

                                <p>The University of Auckland informed me in about 2017 or similar that I was 'ineligible' to apply for MBChB.  That was false, but that was what they told me.  I was acting on the basis of information that they provided to me, when I applied to enrol in a 120 point MPhil thesis with the University of Waikato.  The University of Auckland stated that finishing the 120 point qualification in the 'minimum, normal, or standard time' associated with the qualification would be sufficient for them to regard me to be eligible for MBChB.  The only reason why I applied to the 120 point MPhil programme was because I had been given this advice from the University of Auckland.  Advise, as it turns out, that was very very very very very costly for me.  Both with respect to money (enrolment fees) and also my time.</p>

                                <p>The University of Waikato then refused to process my enrolment for the qualification that I had applied to.  Now, this was not because there were more applicants to the qualification than there were places available in the programme.  I believe (but I do not know) that I was the ONLY APPLICANT TO THAT PROGRAMME.  The programme was listed in the University Calendar.  THe progarmme was approved by the Tertiary Education Commission as being 'right sized' and so on.  But they refuse to process my applicatino to enrol in it.  I applied by the published deadline.  ANd they simply refused to process the application.  Instead, they enrolled me in a qualification with a course code that is not listed in the University acaademic calendar, at all.  They enrolled me in a qualification that I never applied to be enrolled in, with very differnet start dates.  Regardless, I stayed in regular email contact with the person who was my supervisor including sending her work every week so she could see my progress.  She sent me emails saying that she was off on various family holiday trips.  That was nice for her.  All year, the University refused to accept that I was going to submit the 120 MPhil on 14 september to allow up to 3 months externl examination of my thesis so as to make up to 10 weeks of changes, that I thought the externals would likely require, so that I could then have it submitted in hardcopy without re-enrolment being required of me.</p>

                                <p>Three softboudn copies were track and trace signed for by the research school and the Dean refused to get the thesis out for external examination in order to prevent and prohibit external examinaers from signing off on my timely completion of the degree.  The University told me that I was required to 'keep working' and submit a thesis for examination at a later date.  After a couple weeks I supplied them with another thesis and they send the under 50,000 words 120 point MPhil thesis out for external examination with instructions for external examiners to examine it with resspect to acceptability as a 360 point 'doctoral thesis' or PhD.  This was so that externals would be required to say that in order for it to be acceptable as a doctoral thesis it would need changes to the substance, since it would need to be about doubled in length.  The Univeristy then re-enrolled me for more points in the MPhil and said if I did not pay additional fees and undergo additional labor I would never qualify to complete the MPhil.  They chose to employ award winning in house counsel to send me letters saying that I owed them more money else I would never complete the Degree.  Also to inform me that the University was giong to hold me under 'zero fees' indefinately until such time as externls signed off on completion of requirements for the degree.</p>

                                <p>They pulled Justice Toogood out of retirement to hear my case against Waikato.  I claimed specifically they were not properly handling applications to enrol, progressions through training (refusing to get the thesis to examiners, sending it to be examined for the wrong degree).  They were refusing to acknowledge completion of graduate research work.  They were falsely invoicing the studnet loan scheme (for progarmmes of study I never even applied to) and presumably the government as well.  Justice Toogood didn't see anything wrong.  He thought it was his job to tell me that I 'hadn't done enoguh' to complete a 120 point qualification.  He refused to accept that the Tertiary Education Commission decides what 'right sized' means and they define 120 points as 1 academic year as being comprised of 34 weeks work which includes the external examination period.  </p>

                                <p>The New Zealand Vice Chancellors Committee has the statutory function of upholding quality and integrity of NZ University qualifications.  Chris Whelan in his capacity as VC of it has statutory responsibility or duty to hear whistleblower complaints.  The NZVCC has policy documents on how they will handle complaints of wrongdoing from both studnets and staff.  THey say that since I was not staff whisteleblower protections do not apply to me.  The NZVCC said in response to OIA request that they have only received 1 complaint of wrongdoing since CHris Whelan was appointed to office in 2014, I think it was.  That means to say he refuses to acknowledge that he has received any complaints.  Apparently he says that he hears a lot about people complaining about 'personal' or 'relationship' problems, particularly regarding graduate research studnets and various people on payroll to supervise them or get their work to externals, but none of them are accepted by him to be complaints of wrongdoing.  The Judge said that I did everything I needed to do to lodge a complalint of wrongdoing.  So I complained about wrongdoing in fact.  Regarding the University of Waikato keeping false enrolment records and false trnscripts (false enrolment records on the transcripts).  But since the NZVCC writes the NZVCC policy on how they will handle complaints, they don't have to follow the policy they wrote for them to follow because they can change the policy retrospectively. THeir policy stated they would forward the evidnce of wrongdoing to police for govenrment prosecution else have a meeting of the vice chancellors so they could remedy the situation in house preventing the need for prosecution and they do neither of those things.  Chris Whelan says in the name of privacy they throw away the complint and don't acknowledge it and the government will not prosecute wrongdoing within the University.  I have informed the police.  They told me it was a personal private matter for me.  It wasn't public intereset.  The government will not prosecute.  THey will hire a major firm to defend the NZVCC's entitlement to keep false studnet records and false transcripts.  To refuse to enrol.  To refuse to progress through training.</p>

                                <p>So you can see that there isn't an education system in NZ.  Not even trying.  They aren't even trying.  It isn't that they are just a bit sneaky and sly. I mean you catch them out red handed.  And their attitude is 'no no no no no no we refuse to do any of the things we are supposed to do (supplying applications to enrol, processing and progressing them on academic merits, allowing external examination of academic merits, acknowledging completion of all and only those who have met the external standards).  There's just nothing there.  Nobody home.  Not even trying to be.  No tertiary education sector at all. Not even trying to be.  Slave, prison, detention camps.  Up and down the land.  Not even trying.  </p>

                                <p>And the courts?  Well, they don't seem to  be trying, too.  Justices pulled out of retirement to be most unfair in the written judgments characterisation of the cases that I brought before the courts.  Justice Fitzgerald was fine, so far as she went, but she failed to provide teeth.  She did not instruct them to rescind their judgment that was ultra vires about my not being offered enrolment on grounds I was ineligible and replacing that with a judgment that was within the law.  What was my rank order score?  How many equity candidatees had been accepted?  That's enough to know whether or not I should have been offered enrolment.  Also compensatin.  It needs to be too costly to the University to do it wrong so there is financial incentive for them to do it right.  THey should bear the costs of their own inability or unwillingness to do their f*cking job.  </p>

                                <p>The other Justices seem pulled out of retirement to mischaracterise the case that I brought.  If Chris Whelan has the statutory function of upholdling quality and integrity by timely handling of complaints and there is a policy around in house sorting it out and then external prosecution if they won't...  And he is throwing the complaints away..  Then he needs to be removed from office.  He is not willing or able to do the statutory function for which he is on payroll.  He isn't doing the job at all.  What the hell.  Corruption.  Corrutpion, hey.  Is it legitimate to pull judges out of retirement?  What the hell?  Is the idea that it doesn't matter howmuch they mischaracterise the case and refuse to deliver a judgment in the interests of justice because..  What is anybody going to do about it?  Spend the next 100+ years trying to have them removed from office?  COrruption within the Judiary.  Not even trying to uphold justice.  What judiciary?</p>

                                <p>What health system?</p>

                                <p>The last thing Harlene Hayes did was...  Refuse to graduate 1/3rd the medical cohort, wasn't it?  THey had been signed off as having completed the workplace internships that the University of Otago had helped arrange for them to  be sent on.  The University refused to accept that they had been signed off.  I think (but I do not know) that they were then informed that they could go on to their junior doctor positions in the hospital. But, they would need to keep paying the Univerity money for continueed reenrolment and they would have graduation withheld.  So, then, they are passing themselves off as junior doctors in the hospitals, but they are not graduates of the Univeristy of Otago because the University refused to give them the qualifiction.  We were told that 1/3rd had their qualification withheld because of issues with overseas workplace internships. We werent' told how many had their qualifications withheld because of issues with local or domesetic workplace internships.  New Zealand does not appear to have an education and training system.  Relying on work outputs of people kept or held as bonded servants or slaves.</p>

                                <p>How much money do you think someone might pay to get to play doctors and nurses in the hospitals?  How much money would someone pay to, I don't know, get to artificially inseminate women who have been anesthetised for unrelated procedures or...  Do anything anything anyting in the hosptials of New Zealand?  </p>

                                <p>They aren't processing applications to enrol.  They aren't acknowelding progression through trianing.  They aren't supplying graduation to all and only people who have met requiremetns.  Corruption.  THere's nothing there.  They don't seem to be trying, at all.  They hire lwyers to defend their entitltement to refuse to process aplpicatons and so on.  </p>

                                <p>The Australian National University is also refusing to process applications to enrol, over the last few years, at any rate.  I applied so as to see how they would process my application.  They won't process it.  They say my application is incomplete and that is false.  </p>

                                <p>The Australian National University refuses to process student work.  I have over on the writing page a 100,000 + word document that I got to my supervisor and university administration and they won't get work to external examiners.  THey just won't do it.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  They just refuse to do it.  I complain to them and they just refuse to accept that I have complained.  THey say I need to revise and resubmit my complaint over and over and over and over and over.  Gaslighting.  I haven't actually lodged a complaint.  Didn't you know?  I haven't actually applied to be enrolled, I haven't actually done any work.  See all the work that I haven' done over on the writing page.  I must be a randomly generated robot or something.  What the f*ck????</p>

                                <p>I filed everything that needed to be filed for the above cases to progress through the court of appeal.  I filed everything  by the deadline.  In fact, I needed to file various appeals of the court of appeals judgment that none of the above cases were of any public interest at all.  Apparently they are all very very particular and personal to me.  The court of appeal informed me (in the knowledge that I was kept by the NZ government on 'Supported Living Payment' rather than wages that I was required to pay more than $20,000 to the court of appeal in order to progress the above cases.  Things were not held up in the court of appeal because I missed a filing deadline.  Things stopped because the court of appeal demanded that I pay them more than $20,000 'security for costs' on the grounds that the above are not matters of public interest.  This decision of the court of appeal was upheld by the supreme court who ordered additional costs to be paid my be for having filed an appeal with the supreme court on the grounds that the decision of the court of appeal was manifestly unjust.</p>

                                <p>I filed with Work and Income for advance benefit payment so I could pay the security for costs amount set by the courts.  They declined that.  I followed the appeals process for that.  I did not miss any filing deadlines.  The Ministry of Social Developmetn was granted extensions.  The case was heard by the social security tribunal in October.  They still have not delivered judgment on the case.  They say they have no plans to deliver a judgment.  They are overwhelmed, apparently, by all the filings they get. </p>

                                <p>Subsequent to my having recieved the supreme court judgment and the judgment from the benefit review committee I was informed that my mother passed away and some money was coming to me from that.  So, now, if I can pay the security for costs amount that was set by the court of appeal then what?  The court of appeal says the cases have been deemed abandoned.  I was out of time.  I did everything I was required to do by the deadline, various other parties did not do the things they were required to do.  They were given extensions.  They are given payroll.  They are given extensions and payroll.  They order me to file nd refile nd refile and cry cry cry about how they are overwhelmed with all of the filings they have required.</p>

                                <p>There isn't anything here at all.</p>

                                <p>There isn't any psychiatry or any medicine.  It's just a government institution of abuse.  Dr Leeks was revered as a mighty leader.  It wasn't that he was doing anything different from what anyone and everyone else is doing in the name of psychiatry.  Right?  It's hard to try and select for studnets who will not see anything wrong with this kind of thing, studnets who will be active participants.  There doesn't seem to be any indication that things are any different or that people with power want for things to be any different.  They aren't even trying to be fair at all.</p>

                                <p>Socrates said 'the unexamined life is not worth living'.  The univerisities think it is really really funny that they simply refuse to get studnets work out to examiners, refuse to fairly examine it on it's actual merits.  Instead they engage in 'personal' or 'personality' based selection on the basis of nepotism or whatever.  Who they like to party and travel with.  Who makes them feel good about themselves because they smooth their ego only and pander to them.  There's nothing here.  They aren't even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                                <p>I don't even know if it is true or not, but I thought I saw that Ashley Bloomfield had been appointed Professor at University of Auckland.  He isn't 'doctor' in virtue or PhD or MD, though.  I mean to say,  he hasn't applied to study for a research doctorate qualification, he hasn't done the independent work for one.  He hasn't graduated from a research doctoral degree. He isn't qualified to be Professor.  He has an MBChB which the world medical directory lists as an undergraduate level qualification and a...  One year Masters?  Two year Masters?  With a one year coursework and a one year research component?  I suppose being a Professor is an attractive prospect since the High Court has ruled tht you can, effectively, enrol whoever you want for whatever arbitrry reasons you want quite irrespective of whether they have even applied to the University.  You can take a gander at the photogrphs or whatever and record levels of debt against their name and indoctronate them into believing that it's soooooo competitive they must be willing to do anyting you say because you say for as long as you say.  Suck your d*ck on demand or anything anything anything.  Why aren't you regisered to practice Medicine in NZ Ashley?  That's what you are qualified to do -- right?  Or, they only acknowledge that qualification on the understanding that you aren't registered and you never work with patients.  Ayesha...  Shane Reti does the bare minimum to keep up his registration.  Correct?  So his patients can only see him for 1 or 3 weeks of the year, or similar.  NOthing here.  Nobody home.  People don't have healthcare because of politics.  Correct.  Also don't have education.  Also no judiciary.  How's Una Jagose doing?  Still throwing away evidence?  Ensuring that health records are kept insecurely so they can be destroyed or at the very least all be inadmissable as evidnece of the governments crimes against the people.  There' snothing here.  NOt even trying.</p>

                                <p>Do you think Ashley has the capacity to do a research qualification from an Australasian University?  What is involved in doing one?  He would have to get them to get his work out to the external examiners.  Why would they do that?  Why would they get his work out to external examiners?  Why wouldn't they just take his work and never ever ever ever ever sign him off?  Why wouldn't they just take his work and reattribute it to other people?  Then they can appoint as Professors all and only people who steal their studnets work and pass it off as their own.  Or who upload their studnets work to turnitin so that the undergrads of princeton can pass it off as their own.  Or the professors at princeton.  Why not appoint only people who are incapable of doing research and make them slavers of those with capacity.  Never sign off on anybodh with capacity.  Just keep them as slaves.  Theres nothing here.  They won't get the work to the examiners.  They won't allow the examiners to sign off on the studnets work.  Nothing here.  Nobody home.  Not even trying.  </p>

                                <p>We are supposed to believe Ashley Bloomfield has done enough for a Professorship.  He hasn't even done enough for a PhD or an MD.  He never even applied for the Professor job that he isn't even qualified for.  Right?  He was just told that that was where he was being re-deployed to next?  I mean, I don't supppose it is that his research output is any less than the research output of various other people who have been placed on University payroll. To ensure that the work outputs of those with capacity never go to externals.  </p>

                                <p>The most blatant case that I know of was Fiona MacPhearson taking my work on delusions.  She had powerpoint presentation handouts and maybe even access to the written versions of things that I've put on my writing page.  Then she wrote something on delusions and synasthesia that looked really rather a lot like she just took my work and incorporated it into her own and passed it off as hers without any acknowledgment or reference to me.  This was when she was on payroll with a University in Scotland.  I guess that set the tone for everybody else to just take whatever they wanted from me. I mean, what was I going to do about it?  If I complain I must be crazy.  Right?  If you write a thesis about psychiatry that makes you mentally ill.  If you write a thesis about disability that makes you lacking in capacity and if you write a thesis about yellow then, clearly you are yellow.  If you write about trees then I guess that makes you a tree.  There's only nonense.  Nonsense garbage garbage garbage.  There's no sense in how they treated me.  I didn't enjoy spending time with my frienemies.  I wonder why.</p>

                                <p>I saw something in the news to the effect that a medical student had been thrown out of Sydney University after he was pulled before the courts (for the second time) for beating his girlfriend.  I don't know if that was Hylands son or grandson, specifically.  Reynolds son was about the age of going off to Uniersity when Reynolds was made professor. It is a matter of public interest whether he used his position as Professor to expediate selection for his son on the grounds that his son is entitled (one can only suppose) to bypass academic merit based selection.  The Univeristy of Otago has stated that it uses 'alternative' or 'other' selection to select students into medicine who have never studied at Univerity level and some who have never been to polytech or done any tertiary education at all.  They say they are entitled to select whoever they want for whatever arbitrary reasons they want.  They are not even pretending to be a functioning university. </p>

                                <p>I don't want to do Medicine because of these people, because of people such as these.  Can't imagine much of anything worse than having to spend time with frienemies such as them.  The silly games they are playing.  Fact is that most people are not like this.  They expect better from our public servants.  They expect better from university selection process and accreditation programmes and so on.  They expect better when they ask for help from social services and from the hospitals.  They expect better when they apply to university.  They expect  better.  They do.  They really don't know that things are as corrupt as all this.  I think most people would be surprised to learn.  So, now the people understand why we don't have a health system, education system, functioning judiciary.  Because of people's selfishness when it comes to their children and their willingness to use their public position for their own selfish private advantage at the expense of everybody else.  It is true that it is not in the public interest at all.  What they are doing, I mean to say.  Which is something that is in the public interest to learn.  So they know what kind of psychopathic frenemies have taken over our schools and hospitals and universiteis etc.</p>

                                <p>Oh we cannot wait to see...  What Ashley-Bloomfield-Umbridge will decree...  Hem Hem.</p>

                                <p>It is just f*cking garbage of a waste f*cking dump of a waste f*cking land.  There does not appear to be any of the most basic of 'try' from the education system, the health system, the judiciary.  Certain people seem to feel entitled, in fact.  They take up all the training places, they don't follow the laws, they can't / won't make judgments on the basis of them.  There's just nobody home.  Nothing there.</p>

                                <p>During Covid Lockdown I presented to the ED of the Grafton hospital with a likely bacterial infection from a mechnical toe injury from walking too much during lockdown.  This was when they were saying that GPs didn't have enough PPE and the hospitals were not overwhelmed.  Rather, hardly anybody was turning up to them, because people were afraid of Covid.  So I put on my N95 mask and went to the ED.  I said I was also concerned about parasites since I'd been walking a lot in the Domain and was concerned about hookworm since I didn't know the sewerage outflow situation of the swampy ground, there.  So close to the hospital.</p>

                                <p>THey put me in a one person room with no windows and locked the door on me so I could not leave.  THey kept me there for more thn 12 hours.  Nobody had filled out any forms to authorise them to keep me for a psychiatric assessment.  But they refused to supply me with a phone so I could call a lawyer, they refused to supply me with a phone so that I could call the police and report my unlawful detention.  The room that I was placed in was not a suitable room to keep someone if you think they are mentally unwell therefore at risk of harming themself.  There were extensive cords from cardiac equipment.  There was a sharps bin that may  have contained sharps (I didn't check).  THey actually put me in the room with a line / a sharp in my arm.  That's how concerned about my safety they were (yeah, right).  After more than 12 hours they then filled out the paperwork that was needed to keep me for a 5 day observation period.  They then moved me into the most restrictive environment possible.  The most secure ward. </p>

                                <p>I was one of maybe two females on the mostly male ward.  There were no locks on the bedroom doors.  I was required to share single stall bathrooms with male patients.  They did not supply me with sanitary materials in a timely fashion.  They wrote in my notes actually that I was delusional for saying things about blood. </p>

                                <p>They took me into a single isolation, again, and said I was required to take what they claimed was a prescription medication (old generation antipsychotic) orally otherwise they would remove my pants and inject my backside.  FOrcibly.  THey had around 4 male staff who were going to do this.  They were standing around waiting for my 'decision' after having dragged me into seclusion.</p>

                                <p>THey then proceeded to hold me for 7 days.  They were only authorised to hold me for 5.  In the least restrictive environment.  Not the most.  The least.</p>

                                <p>I requested my file notes.  THey supplies scaps of notes here and there via time limited online access only.  I kept requesting, I kept requesting, I kept requesting.  I got sick and f*cking tired of it and initiated Judicial Review of Administrative Action requesting removal from office of the most senior people responsible with the courts.</p>

                                <p>To this day they have supplied no medication charts.  That means to say there is no evidence that a psychiatrist prescribed anything at all for me to take.  So, then, what did they force me to take?  What was it?  They said it was an old generation antipsychotc that had been prescribed for me,  but that was false.  What was it?  Was it LSD?  Was it Ketamine?  What was it? </p>

                                <p>The Auckland District Health Board chose to hire for themselves a Queens Counsel and instructed him to file to have my proceedings thrown out without a substantive hearing.  The Judge instructed for a 2 hour hearing of the matter to have the proceedings thrown out.  In that 2 hour hearing I supplied to the Judge the medical records that had  been supplied to me.  They document how I was detained for more than 12 hours without the necessary paperwork for keeping me in the hospital.  THey document how a phone and lawyer were not supplied to me.  THey document how there were no medication charts for me at all, no prescriptions, and yet they also document how I was taken into seclusion and required to take medication by mouth on threat of injection.  THey document how they continued to keep me for 2 days after the section lapsed.  The Psyhciatry notes say that I am to remain in the hospital on a voluntary basis even though I want to leave.  I am to stay as a volunteer.</p>

                                <p>The Judge said that I was to refile my filings.  That the proceedings were not to be struck out,  but I was to do more filings for the courts.  He refused to schedule a substantive hearing of what I had filed already.  He awarded more than $5,000 costs against me for having lost the application to have proceedings struck out (even though he did not strike the proceedings out).  This was all upheld by the supreme court.  </p>

                                <p>What psychiatry?  What health system?  What judiciary?  THere is nothing here.</p>

                                <p>Who was responsible?  One way of looking at it was that Ashley Bloomfield Umbridge was responsible for the hospitals  being under-staffed.  For not employing actual psychiatrists to work in the hospitals.  What's that Ashley, there aren't any?  Because they wont' publically advertise the jobs.  BEcause they throw teh applications to work there away.  SO that they can make you Professor of the University, now.  </p>

                                <p>Yet another year of wrongly decided people who are supposed to wrongful deathbring and murder and sexually violate and bully and abuse and oppress...  Yet another year.  Yet another year.  They are supposed to do important medical research?  They refuse to calculate a GPA ffs.  Nobody home.  Completely and utterly lacking in the most basic honesty and integrity.</p>

                                <p>They used to kill people with mercury.  They would prescribe it as a treatment for syphilis.  If the syphilis didn't kill you then the mercury would.  Cancer treatments can be that, as well.  People confuse the toxic side effects of the medciation with the condition that was the reason for them to start taking the medication.  Screening tests that themseves promote if not overtly cause the cancers they are screening for.  </p>

                                <p>Why would you think that the health system would be about health anymore than the justice system would be about justice anymore than the education system would be about education?  There's nobody home.  Nothing here.  The government broke the social contract in fact.  The people who have hijacked the social services holding everyone to hostage while they use public resources and so on for their own selifish private advantage to the ruin of us all.</p>

                                <p>So, while I'm being involuntarily detained in a seclusion cell I'm wondering why...  I mean, is the idea that since people aren't presenting to the hospital they really need to keep anybody who does (to keep the beds fill since they probably get more money for having the beds filled).  I wonder if the room I am being kept in specifically is cardiology so they get more money from cardiology for keeping me in that room.  I think about how we keep hearing about various people who ask for help and various families who ask for help.  How they don't get the help they need because the health system is too busy involuntarily detaining under conditions the UN has declared amount to torture in fact various people who don't want to be there.  Claiming they are 'volunteers' who are there 'voluntarily'.  You don't need to post security outside and keep locks on the doors of the ward to prohibit people from leaving when they are there voluntarily.  It isn't a hospital, is it.  No.  It is something different entirely.  It is most concerning when we hear that students are raped in their university residential halls, detained in the name of psychiatry, then deported without their qualifications.  It is concerning to hear Auckland manufacturing LSD when the hospital refuses to keep accurate medical records.  It isn't a hospital.  And it doesn't appear to be a university, either.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  The Judiciary refuses to function.  I suppose because they couldn't / wouldn't process applications to and completions from law either.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.</p>

                                <p>I have written to the Minister of Justice and asked the Ministry to remind the Social Security Tribunal of Government expectations on the timliness on delivery of judgments.  THis is not the same as asking for political pressure to affect the CONTENT of the judgment.  Can you hear the difference.  The Ministry of Justice refuses to acknowledge receipt of my complaint.</p>

                                <p>No indication of the slightest little hint of 'try'.  All of they payroll for them.  So they can say that they are too busy being sick and too busy being off on holiday to do their f*cking job.  Why didn't the ANU get my work out to external examiners when it was time for that to be done?  The external examiners are meant to decide whether the studnet had done enough or not and what changes may need to be made for the student to then be signed off. And they simply refuse.  THey will not do it.  ALl of these people on payroll who refuse to do their job.  All of the payroll for them.  All of the payroll for them.  All of the payroll for them to keep slaves.</p>

                                <p>Justice Toogood did  not see anything wrong with the University of Waikato refusing to enrol me in the programme I applied to when I applied by the published application deadline and I was eligible to be enrolled in the programme and the programme was not oversubscribed since I was the only applicant for it.  He didn't see anything wrong with the Univesrity invoicing my studnet loan and the government for claiming to have enrolled me in courses of study that aren't listed in the University Calendar, even.  Then them refusing to get my work to external examiners, repeatedly.  Refusing to accept that I had submitted work for external examination.  What could 'keeping false records' (of enrolment) possibly mean?  If it doesn't mean claiming to have enrolled students in qualifications the studnets never applied to.  Claiming to be supervising students and then refusing to get their work out to externals to prevent and prohibit externals from signing off on completion fo the qualification?  The Government refuses to arrange for prosecution of the Univesrity keeping false enrolment records.  Claiming on my university transcript to have failed me for progarmmes of study that I never even applied to be enrolled in.  Claiming on my Inland Revenue Department account that I owe them money for programmes of study I never applied to be enrolled in.</p>

                                <p>Not even trying.  Hey.  Not even trying a little bit.</p>

                                <p>With 'friends' like these...  With Professionals like these appointed to most lucrative paid government payroll positions...  With people like Andrea Howard having been re-deployed to refuse to process applications for humane ways of dealing with the possum problem.  Redeploying Peter Crampton to the Southern District Health Board so he can ensure that only the Junior Doctors behind the Professor Glue Factory giving ketamine to teenagers and killing them off when they won't shut up about the crimes of various officials...  Dr Leeks 2.0...  I suppose that's the real push to enrolling people's children.  Did Dr Leeks have children?  Were they expediated into Medicine because (the ideology was) they would be most likely to continue on his crimes?  Was that the basic ideology?  </p>

                                <p>Didn't these Justices pulled out of retirement for the occasion leave sons or grandsons or great grandsons to ignore half the laws, make false claims about evidence, ignore half the evidence.  Do everything they can to obstruct and prevent and prohbit justice?  Where are there children?  Expediated into Law, probably - right?  Or expediated into Medicine?  So they can tell the judges that they want to keep this one or that one heavily drugged in a psychiatric hospital and it isn't in their 'patients' interest for their patient to have a fair trial or appear before the court or not appear in a sufficient drugged state etc.  Not 'healthcare'.  Not 'justice'.  There doesn't appear to be anything here at all...  Not even trying.  Not even the slightest f*cking hint of f*cking 'try'.</p>

                                <p>We are supposed to believe that all the NZ medical graduates are employed in Australia.  But that is not plausible.  What happens is that they say 'you are require to pass yourself off as junior doctor while you pay the univerity you pay the university you pay the university you pay the university'.  Then, when you are done paying the university you are imprisoned.  That seems to be what NZ likes to do, now.  When it is time to graduate studnets from training (and pay them for doing the job) it is time for the student to be vanished.  Imprisoned.  That's a great idea.  Make an impossible degree programme.  Maybe get the students writing 'I did seek external tuition to study for the UMAT' so that you can feel justified refusing to pay them because they lack the willingness or ability to follow the most basic of instructions.  Maybe get the studnets documenting their crimes in the ethics class.  Writing up about how they have been sexually violating patients performing 'unauthorised cervical exams' shall we call them without the patients consent.  Select for all and only those students so we don't have to feel bad about marching them off to prison or death camps or whatever when it is time to graduate them from their training programme and pay them.  And pay them and pay them.  To put the students to work pay the university pay the university pay the university.  Then it's time for you to die. They broke the social contract.  There is nothing here.  Nobody home.  Australia pretends to be too f*cking stupid to be able to parse it's own f*cking constitution ffs.  Not even trying to be rule by law at all.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  Not even trying.  Not even a tiny little bit of 'try'.   </p>

                                <p>How long can it possibly take for the Social Security Tribunal to declare that they don't see anything wrong with the Government refusing to process applications for training or employment, refusing to enrol or employ the people with the relevant academic merits and experience and qualifications, them choosing to hold people on less than minimum wage government welfare so that the courts can claim that it's all very very peresonal anad particular against that individual, not a matter of public interest at all, and refuse to process or progress filings complalining about the government keeping false records.  Refusing ot process applications for training.  Refusing to do any of the things that government is supposed to do.  There's nothing here.  Nobody home.  NOt even trying to be rule  by law.  The people employed don't seem to have the willingess or ability or..  Capaciaty..  Training?  THey don't seem capable or competent to even understand what any of it means.   No speak the English.  Just open their mouths and f*cking garbage falls out.  Just f*cking garbage.</p>

                                <p>Hey InJustice Toogood.  How much they pay you to not see anyting wrong with the deaths of Mason Pendrous and Olivia Podmore?  To not see anything wrong with the University of Waikato refusing to do any of the most basic of things that it's supposed to do with respect to keeping accurate graduate student enrolment records and getting theses to external examiners?  HOw much do they pay you?  ANd how was it that you came to be appointed to office, anyway?  You were retired..  And then you were offered a job as High Court Judge.  Is there some kind or sort of process for that is there?  Or did they re-write the laws especially for you?  Did they re-write the laws saying that it was okay to employ retired people as Judges before or after you were appointed as Judge?  I'm just curiosu whether you think you are required to follow the laws or whether you think that you are God so that the laws should all be rewritten around you?  For how long are you supposed to sign you pawprint on things claiming to be judgements of the courts?  For the next 100 years?  When are you going to die, InJustice Toogood?  Christ...  When do you plan on dying, already?  How many years of government payroll have you had, already?  HOw many years of governmetn payroll for you?  Are you that f*cking broke that you need to be employed now?  You weren't able to train any studnets over however many years to do whatever it is that you do?  God.  I hope not.  Time to get out of the f*cking way I would have thought...  Let somebody competent come through...  Well, it's obvoiusly in the Bag with Justice toogood.  ALl of the money and all of the bags.  All of the everything for f*cking you.  WHat a f*cking joke.  If you were competent I wouldn't need to cast about for a reason why you are in the position you are in when you are obvously and clearly not competent.  What could 'keeping false records' possibly meeeeeeean?  How long did it take you to do your 2 year Masters in law at Yale, Justice Toogood?  4 years?  Longer?  How can you possibly be too stupid to understand that a 1 year masters should be completable in 1 year.  There are 2  year masters programmes..  Of course.  Usually comprised of 1 year of (roughly honors level) course work.  Then a 1 year thesis.  What's that?  A 1 year thesis.  Did you write your own 1 year thesis at Yale Justice Toogood?  Or did someone give you the work outputs of someone else to pass off as your own?  DId it seem to you that your supervisor wrote it for yuo?  WHo writes your judgments for you?</p>

                                <p>Who paid for you to go to Yale for a 2 year Masters in Legal Studies?  Was that a New Zealand Government initiative?  The taxpayers paid for you to go to Yale and get used to having Judgments given to you by various people over there.  Was that the idea?  I guess Yale and Harvard probably gets students to write the Judgments for the third world nations.  The ones that can't / won't send them anybody with the actual capacity to do the thing.  They can just go and be given things from others and pass those off as their own.  I don't imagine or suppose that you write your own Judgments, InJustice Toogood.  You don't hear so well.  There are none so blind as those who will not see.  Not even trying to uphold Justice or Fairness.  Do you even have the capacity to apprehend such things?  That is your legacy.  Well done.  The prevention and prohibition of justice.  The promulgation of injustice.  Well done, you.  Well done.  I guess Ashley can find 40 virgins to your liking and meet you someplace for 'better do this if you want to be signed off as having completed your qualification' (and then haha fooled you just kidding) 'degree' programme.  Yeah, right...</p>

                                <p>It is very informative to see the High Court at Auckland so unattended.  I mean to say the Law studnets don't even bother to attend court days.  There isn't any point.  It isn't like they can learn to be better lawyers by watching the InJustices or Lawyers in action.  They would only be exposed to just how corrupt the courts are.  Seeing how the Judges refuse to listen to what is being said (e.g, the issue being the legal issue of the legal term 'eligible').  Seeing how the judges bully and abuse people.  Basically.  Effectively.  We dont' appear ot have a functioning law system at all.  Prosecution is incompetent.  I suppose because some people's kids think that it sounds like a sexy cool job so they put those kids on the payroll.  But they aren't actually competent to prosecute anything at all. But even if they were, it wouldn't matter, because none of the evidence is admissible.  THey wouldn'dt have said they graduated from police training college if they didn't learn all about how they are supposed to ensure that the evidence is inadmissable.  Then they can simply bully the person they find most bully-able and scapegoat them.  Instead of having a legal system.  We can just do that.  Find the person who seems most bully-able and scapegoat them.  There's really nothign here...  I don't see anybody really trying to do any different.</p>

                                <p>Guffaw guffaw guffaw.  How do we get her to become a terrorist.  Else kill herself already?  Front row with popcorn.  I'm sure there are many incompetent inbreds who are watchign in rapt awe..  It isn't like they are interested in anything else..  It is their entitlement.  Of course.  Might is right.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/new-crown-solicitor-for-auckland-announced/QOZVTDM6PVBHPMZXN6IVRAJHXY/  Meredith Connell Receptionists say that Meredith Connell can't prosecute this, that, and the other thing, because the government department has put a dollar in their pocket already since Meredith Connell is private also public.  So the government can put a dollar into the private Meredith Connell so that the Public Meredith Connell can't prosecute the government for corruption.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.</p>

                                <p>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-64495673  But there aren't any jobs for you.  People in your parents generation and your grandparents generation thought that they wanted more than 40 years of government payroll for themselves so you lot need to go off to death camps, already.  No jobs for you.  All of the money for them.  So they can have multiple houses and keep harems of slaves.</p>

                                <p>Hi Sterelny!!!! Hi!!!! Hi!!!! have you sent my thesis out for external examination yet?  Any comments for me, then?  What changes should I make before it gets sent out?  Have you managed to get out your pen yet to start work.  You are paid to supervise me.  No?  You are on payroll to supervise me.  What work have you done, then?  Any comments for me?  When shall I meet with you?  ANy plans to read my work?  Hi!!!! Hello!!!! Anybody home???  F*cking psychopath.  For f*cking real.  Hiiiiii Who wants to go driiiiinking...  Hey just look after my house for me, okay...  I'm too f*cking lazy to pay someone to do it.  Respect.  Basic f*cking professionalism.  Are you f*cking dead yet?  F*cking hell...  WOrse.  Supervisor.  Ever.  Nobody home ffs.</p>

                                <p>You have got these kids, right.  And their parents do EVERYTHING for them.  All the very very very very best of everything that money can buy.  THeir parents really go gunning for them.  They get all the very very very very best of everything.  The best of the housing.  The best of the teachers.  The best schools.  The very very best of everything.  Every opportunity.  But still...  But still they can't get a place on the basis of their academic merits.  You have to engage in corrupt practices to throw various other applications away because your f*cking precious children are that f*cking stupid that they just can't do it without your gunning for them.  Pulling out all the corruption things that you can do to cut everybody else off at the knees.  Because depriving everybody else of housing and so on still wasn't enoguh.  Your kids are that f*ckign stupid.  Do you get it, yet?  Can you see??  That f*cking stupid.  Making hostages of us all.  Duh....  It's tooooo f*cking haaaard.  Wait for me.  DO it for me.  Just hand over all your stuff!!! Mine!!!! mememememe f*cking me.  I'm sooooo selfish..  Alllll of the f*ckign everything for me!!! Duuuuuh!!!! Buy me a place in Medicine Dadddy!!!!! I wanna go rape the aboriginals!!!  I'm too f*cking stupid to calculate a GPA!!! But I'm supposed to be working with Harvard to make a vaccine.  Yeah, right.  I'm too f*cking stupid to tell the difference between 'eligible' and 'entitled' when one (and only one of those terms) is in the education act.  I'm too f*cking stupid to focus on what is relevant for a judgment.  Too f*cking stupid to write a judgment.  That's why alllll of the law training places to me and my stupid f*cking friends so we can pat ourselves on the backs about how f*cking stupid we f*cking well are making everything worse for everyone every f*cking day.  NZ is in the Australian constitution as a state of Australia.  But everyone is too f*cking stupid to read english.  Too f*cking stupid.  It's like a f*ckign taser to the brain.  No point f*ckign speaking.  Nobody here.  NOthing home.  Overtaken by stupid.  Unbelievable.  Lobotomies all round.  No doubt.  Fixing up the nasal polyps.  Nobody here.  Not even trying.  Just nothing here at all.  What a f*cking joke.</p>

                                <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/483996/new-health-minister-at-odds-with-frontline-healthcare-workers-over-staff-shortages  Every year you get a new intake of junior doctors, that's right.  And the last thing that Harlene Hayes did (before she was redeployed from Otago to Western Australia) was put the 'students' to 'work' in the hospitals passing themsleves off as Junior Doctors while they paid the university, they paid the university, they paid the university, while their graduation was withheld becuase the university refused to acknowledge they had completed the requirements of the qualification because it refused to accept they had  been signed off as having completed the internships the university had sent them on.  No surprises that they want foreign (and domestic) students to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the university and pay and pay and pay to sit 'examinations'.  Probably examinations where a few people sit around and throw away the examination scripts so the actual paid positions (and the training accreditation) can go to the rapist murdering children of the administration only.  THe kids it was always going to go to.  Quite irrespective or regardless of the actual knowledge or ability of the candidates.   Nothing at all to do with luck.  If it was luck it would be a mirror on society.  How society actually is.  But they are trying to socially engineer society so that it looks like the outputs of their f*cking medical doctor breeding programme.  NOt even trying even a teeny tiny little bit.  Can't / won't process the applications. </p>

                                <p>I mean..   Socially engineering New Zealand to look like Peter Crampton in the name of equity.  Yikes.</p>

                                <p>They are right that the way they are going about it is not a 'sustainable' or 'long term' solution.  The Holocaust was supposed to be the 'final solution'.  I think that's what needs to happen, here?  Just bomb the crap out of it.  What alternative is there?  What alternative can there be?  When they would have us believe that 90 to 98 per cent of the 'people' in this region are criminal degenerates without a sense of morality.  Unwilling and unable to demonstrate basic levels of reading comprehension.  Unwilling and unable to process applications on merits.  Nepotism.  But not only or just nepotism...  If they can get their kids merit selection based overseas they will do that...  So it's just the worst of the criminal degeneate children of the inbreds who are expediated the all of the everything in these lands.</p>

                                <p>And of course it isn't that they are stupid.  I don't believe in stupid (as standardly conceived)  it is that their motivations, inclincations etc are different.  For example, they go to university to have morning tea and lunch and afternoon tea.  THey pat each other on the back telling each other how clever they are and take take take from others who they don't think are cool enough.  Or whatever.  People who don't seem to enjoy their company.  How am I supposed to enjoy their company when they aren't progressing my work?  They aren't doing tehir f*cking jobs?  I'm sure the judges are very very very popular in the whiskey bar and their social clubs.  Everybody wants to play golf with them etc etc.  Well, then, all of the everything for them then.  They are like the children who like to play games where they are over-powered.  Except it isn't a game and they are not children.  </p>

                                <p>I speak simply.  THat is ignored.  I speak simply.  That is ignored.  I explain more.  Still ignored.  I explain more.  Still ignored.  After a while I start producing something they think is garbeled.  Of course.  That's because they never were going to listen.  I can die or produce garbled garbage.  I wouldn't have needed to file ANYTHING AT ALL with the courts if the Univesrities had been able to see a problem and actually move to fix it.  I wouldn't have needed to put in any official requests for information.  Their f*cking stupidity makes so much stupid work for htem nd their f*cking stupid.  So they can say they have no plans to do the job for which they are paid (deliver timely judgmetents for example).  Well then allll of the everything for them.</p>

                                <p>So, there we go.  Australaia.  That is the state of it.  There's nothing here.  The present day leaders govern like they are terrorists over their people.  There is no alternative.  All the 'alternatives' are just as bad as each other.  Playing the 'how low can we go' game and 'there is no alternative'.  The wrong people won the war in these parts, that's for sure.  Nobody was held to acount for WW2 atrocities in these parts and they simply never stopped.  There is not a functioning education syste, health system, judicial system.  There is nothing here.  They are focused on eliminiating those they perceive to be vulnarble.  Kuru.  There's nothing here.  There is no reasoning with them.  THey cannot or will not hear it.  There is nothing here.  So...  Send your undesirables here, everybody.  Every nation of the world.  Let Australasia be the detention slave prison camp for the world.  Let it be everything the leaders tiny little hearts and minds and brains desire.  There is no alternative.  The final solution.  There is nothing here.</p>

                                <p>Send all your rapist pedophile bully abusers wrongful deathbringers to Australaia.  We will give them a population to oppress and sicken and weaken and all the resources they need to mismanage and misadministrate and ensure the prevention and prohbition of social development and the furtherment of injustice and sickness and weakness and everything it is that we most value in and for this world.  We will give them all the titles and honors and most lucrative of government payroll to do anything anything anything.  But only if what their nastly little hearts and minds desire involves these qualities that we most value in upside down and back to front land.  Everything we want the world to be.</p>

                                <p>So.  We won't need to train a workforce.  We can just take all the people struck off from overseas.  Just take all of the Medical Graduates from Harvard and Yale and the like.  Ones that have been depoloyed to Australasia because they thought they would fit in better here given everything it is that we value.  </p>

                                <p>I mean...  What am I supposed to say or think?  Oh.  My problem is that I thought things were supposed to be fair.  Right.  I see...  Whereas...  THings are not supposed to be fair?  That's what we are busily working towards, then?  Is that the ideal of it?  People don't have healthcare in these parts because they will never ever ever ever ever allow anybody to work that job.  Not going to happen.  That's where they like to put the worst of the physical and sexual offenders.  Because they can call it 'medical examination' and 'medical treatment' and 'medical research' and people have some idea of what playing doctors and nurses is supopsed to involve.  The injustice system is mostly about imprisonment.  But together they can keep as many people involuntarily detained in conditions of torture as they can get away with.  For their own entertainment, or something, I suppose.  Apparently it's for the children.  Making the world a better place for their children.  So that their children can have hostages slaves prisoners, too.  Because that is the most desirable thing of all, of course.  THe most valuable.  Everything it is that we value.  Seems to be.</p>

                                <p>Isn't it strange how the only ones who claim to need 'more time' are those who are paid by the hour or day or week or month or year.  All of the extra time for them and all of the money too.  So they can cry cry cry about how poor poor them simply doesn't have the freedom to do the job for which they are paid.  Cry cry cry cry cry we don't have any research output because we don't have any academic freedom.  Cry cry cry.  We need extensions after extensions after extensions because we are toooooooo stuuuuuuupid to hit 'forward' on the email so that the work that was sent in to us is forwarded out from us to external examiners so the work can be externally examined on it's merits.  Too stupid?  No?  That's not the problem?  WHat is the problem then?  Cry cry cry cry cry about how it's toooooo haaaaaard.  Well then I suppose the only solution can be more and more and more money for you to cry cry cry cry cry about how you don't have freedom to do the job for which you are paid.  Cry cry cry cry cry poor poor you.  Poor f*cking you.  Party party party party party.  Who wants to have a party?  Cry cry cry cry about how you are too f*cking stupid to do your f*cking job.  And too f*cking immoral to get out of the f*cking way.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>That is, of course, exactly what they are doing.  I mean to say that nobody was every trying to breed a race of elite.  What people were trying to do (what they have not stopped trying to do) is to get better and better at undermining and stabotaging as many others as they possibly can.  Getting the infants conceived in alcohol and pickeled in it in utero.  Then removing them early and putting them in an incubator so they can ensure they are sufficiently oxygen deprived.  They are intentionally trying to breed them and set them up for a lifetime of poverty and sickness and deprivation and dependency.  Trying to breed happy little house-elf slaves who will do anything anythin anything.  Socially engineer it to be so.  That's the plan the goal the aim the purpose the point.  That is the aspirational motivational desirable goal.  To become God!  To win the great hierarchy of life game!  To have alllllll the slaves.  So get out there, everybody!  Take a chance!  Have a go!  Get in there!  Take what you can for as long as you can because you can!  Then cry cry cry about how it wasn't your fault that you were too stupid by design.</p>

                                <p>They aren't trying to create a world that is good for people.  They are trying to socially engineer hell on earth for as many people as possible.  Relatively speaking.  That appears to be the aim the goal the purpose or the point.  You need to cry cry cry cry cry about the inevitability of selfishness and so on in order to get funding for the brilliant ideology that we all busy ourselves working busily towards making the world as horrible and nasty for as many people as possible for one child.  One special child who will get to be lord and master over everybody else.  God.  The God child.  Your child.  Of course.  But, then, why not eat your child and you could be God instead.  Right Justice Mander?  How about you take your kids jobs and your grandkids jobs and your great grandkids jobs and you be judge for the next 100 years.  Or is the idea that each of your kids is going to go out there and exterminate a few island villages...  Go artificially inseminate an aboriginal community or two or all of the aboriginal communities.  I'm trying ot understand why Medicine is sooooooooooo competitive.  Oh, because its about the power to help myself to you.  I see...  Well then.  I guess you have to pass the psychopathy test (establish your fitness to eliminate many many many people and deprive and sicken many manhy people) before they will even consider who your Daddy is.</p>

                                <p>It does not make any sense.  They are not even trying to be fair, at all.</p>

                                <p>They do not think.  Is what I realise.  They do not think.  And they are not trying, at all.</p>
