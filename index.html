                        <div class="container">

                            <p> https://www.nzherald.co.nz/travel/go-back-to-australia-expat-told-after-offensive-us-flag-tiktok-post/NXOWDA4MLJCPNOYQ2O64HXLFUY/  That's because if you got into a car or something and drove out to the suburbs...  The places where tourists aren't likely to go...  You'd see the confederacy flags  being flown.  People sitting on their front porches with their guns waiting for the US government officials to turn up.  That would be 'get off of my property.  One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand - BANG'.   </p>

                           
                            <p>There is an age of retirement for civil servants / government employees.  Many of them were expedited into their payrolled positions on the basis of who their parents were, more than anything else, and they've had 45+ years of government payroll so they could keep entire harems of dependents.  And now it's time for them to retire.  Only, they won't get out.  How old is Justice Toogood?  Since when did reappointing a Judge who was past the age of retirement constitute a Judge having been appointment by proper process?  We are really expected to believe that abosolutely nobody else could have worked that job.  We'll need to blackbird for some foreigner to work it.  Lure them here under false pretences.  Get them to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for visa processing and moving expenses.  Then simply not pay them and awwwww.  What are they going to do about it?  Them and whose army?  How many 'medical doctors' are over the age of 65.  Still on government payroll.  They won't train anybody else, they won't register anybody else.  Mostly they don't actually know anything.  They were hurried into postition when they were 17 or 18.  Quickly quickly quickly before the people realise they don't know anything and they simply aren't that bright.  Get in there!  Have a go!  Abortions.  Euthanasia.  Arficial insemination.  Knock-out babies.  Gene studies.  Fixing up the nasal polyps (labotomies).  Electric stimulation to the genitals.  The babies in the incubators.  Experiments on oxygen deprivation and setting them up for a lifetime of 'I'm soooo lucky I'm a gamma baby I don't have to work half as hard as Ashley Bloomfield'...  The only game in town.  Can't even / won't even process applications for enrolment.  Won't acknowledge progression through training.  Can't even / won't even get work to external examiners.  What University?  What Health System?  What Judiciary?  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  There's really nothing there, hey.  All these people over 65 years on payroll and however many of the next generation expected to just f*ck off and die, then, so that the likes of Justice Toogood can have yet another day in court.  He can't even / won't even see anything wrong...  Poor Dr Leeks.  Poor Dr Green.  What they were doing wasn't any different or any worse than anything that everybody else on payroll was or is doing.  Right?  Poor poor them.  Best give them more and more government handouts to enable them to move someplace new and continue on with their crimes.  </p>

                            <p>The NZ government cries and cries and cries about how it doesn't have enough money.  But it refuses to collect taxes that every other nation collects.  Will not do it.  Insists on being a tax haven for all the criminals of the world.  That is the function of NZ.  Right?  To be a prison camp detention facility.  That always was the function of Australasia.  To be a destination location that was attractive to all the criminals of the northern hemisphere.  Try and lure them here all voluntary-like.  All the criminals of the northern hemisphere.  NZ and Australia doesn't need to train doctors or lawyers or engineers.  We can take the incompetent ones struck off for malpractice from the Northern Hemisphere.  America and England can threaten their students with being shipped to the colonies having to mind the gamma babies arranging for their overexposure to lead and so on so that Des can't see anything wrong you simply can't prooove that there is an association between exposure to lead and brain damage.  It isn't brain damage, anyway, Williams Syndrome is endemic and it's culturally normal for no attachment to a paraticular or specific individual to form and...  The dumb and dumber show.  The problem of evil.  Indeed.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  More than 45 years of government payroll.  Get the f*ck out.  Payroll stops.  Why is that so f*cking hard to understand?  Nobody home.  Nothing there, hey.</p>
