                            <article>

                                <p> My understanding is that the courts did not consider the question of whether the infant needs surgery (what options there may be and what risks may be involved with the different options).  The parents and courts all assumed that there was 'my way or the highway' with respect to what the surgeon / surgical team / hospital staff were saying and the highway involved the likely death in the near future for the infant.  The only optionw was open heart surgery apparently (not a balloon catheter) and the open heart surgery was likely to require blood products.  Nobody questioned those things.  Nobody questioned how or why the baby had a defective valve in the first place. Or whether the baby in fact had a defective valve at all.  That is important with respect to competency of the party that the courts wanted to grant custody to.  For example, if it turns out that they didn't even have a radiology report on the state of the heart and whether that kind of condition rights itself as the kid grows or not...  If they didn't even have secure imaging to show that there was the problem that they say that there is...  If they don't even have accurate records about the child.  If the condition was caused by (for example) giving the mother steroids to induce premature delivery so they could keep it in a Fisher and Paykal incubator in conditions that has a tendancy to result in enlarged heart size and various problems..  Then the competency of the surgical team / hospital staff would be in question.  It would be good to hear some expert witness or testimony from clinically trained people from overseas about best practice in circumstances such as these.  About whether the open heart surgery is the only option, whether blood products are even needed, whether there is reason to believe the kid has stenosis, whether there is reason to believe that operations are needed.  And, of course, a good review of precisely what it is that they are doing to the kid when the kid is institutionalised into their custody.  The decisions they are making on behalf of the parents about various aspects of care that tehy believe they are entitled to make following on from the court order.  Whether they are keeping the parents properly informed of the reasons why they are choosing to do things their way (what other liberties they are taking), I mean to say...  </p>

                                <p>I was a firm believer in vaccinations.  I would have personally chosen to take my vaccinations when they were available to me.  But then I saw how the NZ Government bullied people into complying with Government directive.  How our Government was so quick to grant exemption from liability to the manufacturers of the vaccinations saying that the Government would accept personal liability for harms arising.  Seeing how the Government refuses to pay out the victims of abuses in state care.  That is or means to say the most plalusible reason why it was the Government waived manufacturers liability for harms arising for the people of New Zealand was because they were selling out the health of the New Zealand people.  They waived the manufacturers liabiltiy because of why?  Why?  So they could get cheaper vaccines?  But why not simply allow people who didn't want one to not have one, then, and that way you wouldn't need to have so many of them...  It just doesn't make any sense...  They were hoping that we would get sent the defective ones?  The ones that were more radiclly experimental than everywhere else?  Begging for the ones most likely to result in most harm?  It just doesn't make any sense why the NZ Government was so very very quick to do something that seemed only to be to sell out the health of the people.  </p>

                                <p>If they won't uphold 'no' then there is no power to say 'yes'.  We don't have informed consent in New Zealand.  People are not supplied with information so they can make informed decisions.  The courts weren't supplied with the information that they needed to make an informed decision about what was in the best interests of the child.  They did not hear from diverse experts.  'My way or the highway  because mine is the only expert opinion that will be acknowledged as expert opinion by the Government and the only opinion I am allowed to express if I want to stay on Government payroll as expert' is not enough for anybody to make an informed decision on the basis of that information.  Dissentors aren't allowed in New Zealand.  Anybody who says anything different or critical is duly exterminated.  Not funded.  Disabled incapacitated handicapped bullied to death by the New Zealand Government.  The reason why I did not have a second vaccination is not because I doubt the science behind vaccination.  It is because I doubt the honesty and integrity of the New Zealand Government.  They won't process my applicaiton to enrol in Medicine according to the algorithn that they published for the purposes of accountability.  They are choosing whoever they want for whatever arbitrary reasons they want.  That is the process by which they arbitrarily chose Dr Leeks and various other colleageues..  Ones who did not choose me.  I'm not taking it personally...  But I do find that much of their research is dubious, at best.  Maybe I am wrong about my concerns.  Well, then, they should be big enough and ugly enough to answer my concerns, then.  I am very willing to admit that I was wrong and sometimes I do in fact turn out to be.  But it's just not plausible that in a country of this size with this many people being vaccinated, we haven't had any cases of any harms arising from vaccines.  Other countries, with apparently worse or lower vaccination rates than us, have, however.  So, how can that be?  It just doesn't make any sense.  It defies credibility.  There is no baseline signal coming out of New Zealand.  The honesty and integrity is sorely lacking.   </p>

                                <p>I think there likely are many legitimately serious concerns that we should have about quite a lot of or quite a few of the, particularly major, research projects that various people are up to, within New Zealand.  Many of them are in fact parts of international or world health studies or investigations.  It seems that New Zealand has signed up for or been signed up for being the control group (no treatment) or getting the wrong end of the stick (so to speak) on what treatments are offered (e.g., the ones likely to result in harms, most notably) and that there is no informed consent because individuals have been signed up for experimental conditions or observational conditions that they are required to be kept in for the duration of the experiment, study, or trial.  The health professionals and the governmetn is supposed to stand up for the people of New Zealand, however.  And they won't do it.  I can't tell if that is ignorance or stupidity or maliciousnes or malevolence or hopelessness much of the time.  I don't know...  But this country only appears to be going backwards...  </p>


                                <p>The most plausible reason that I can think of as to why the NZ Government agreed to waive manufacturers liabilty for harm arising is becuase the manufacturers were likely concerned that NZ did not have a health workforce willing and or able to follow the manufacturers instuctions as to how the vaccine was to be transported, stored, and administered.  There were specific and particular instructions provided by the engineers or designers or manufacturers or researchers, you see.  That were based on conditions that they researched.  So, how many doses were to be taken from each vial.  What the expiration dates or hours were for each of the vials or each of the doses reconstituted from the contents of the vials.  Instructions as to how they were to be reconsituted.  The manufacturers liabiltiy extends to what?  To the vaccine being administered and administrated by people with a certian degree or competence and training and so on and so forth.  Teh abiltiy to follow basic instructions.  Instead of 'let's get together and have a yakkity yak yak yak about how we want to do things in our unique socio-cultural environment of New Zealand'.  When more doses were taken from the vials (when we did not have low dead space syringes, even) without our even checking in with the manufacturers first about the possibility.  And so on.  Most of the harms arising were, the manufacturers plausibly thought, ones arising from the local environment.  Ones they couldnt' control..  NOt without sending in an army of Harvard Grads, or similar...</p>

                                <p>So...  This was the kind of information that featured or factored into my decision to say no to second and subseqent vaccination.  Also my recognition that I couldn't say 'yes' becuase I couldnt' say 'no'.  There isn't informed consent in our health system because of the whole bully compliance thing...  The people kept held detained as hostages in our health system.  My recent unlwful detention . NO accurate heath records were kept.  I was given a dose of antibotics in the ED under emergency authorisation from a nurse..  But then no medication charts were available for the remainder of my stay.  So was I allowed to complete the full course of anti-biotics?  Or are they doing everything they can to breed anti-biotic resistent infections in the hospital?  This country makes no sense at all...  I'd think it was incompetence or ignornce.  But the refusal to process my application to Medicine according to the algorithm that was published for the purposes of their accountability makes it considerably more likely that there is genuine maliciousness and ill intent.</p>

                                <p>I wonder if, this weekend, some other kid dies (where the parents were crying out for help from the hospital system) only there wasn't a bed for their kid becuase the hosptial people were too busy being all up in this other kids business. We can't help you becuase there never will be enough to go around. Going out of their way to do everything everything everything for this other kid (bill the government for everything they could get for having him) and getting on on telling the parents that they had control to do anything anything anything they wanted to their kid for the weekend.  Before, you know, handing it back.  The worst of the helecopter science.  Brought to you by New Zealand...  Culture of  bullies in fact.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1jPUB7gRyg  Here comes the 18  year old children of the administration!!!</p>

                                <p>Actually...  Black people's blood is not the same as white people's blood.  For example, there is higher prevelence of sickle cell anemia in black people's blood.  They think that it protects from maleria.  That was how they were able to kill of the (white) endentured servants with maleria when it was time to pay them for the work that they had done on the plantations whereas they kept the african american's (black) as slaves refusing to pay them that way.  Also, studies were done on black people.  For example, the effects of untreated syphilis on the negro male.  They thought it would be  great idea to intentionally infect or to withhold penicillin (an effective treatment) from black males in order to see what would happen, or some such.  They knew enough to target that particular group for the observational study.  I mean to say the researchers weren't enrolling their bosses or their friends or their brothers into those kinds or sorts of experiments.  They were decidedly for the 'other'.  The syphilis studies appear to me to be broadly comparable to our rheumatic fever studies.  Except that we are targeting children whereas they went after adult males.  </p>

                                <p>I don't know why they are so restrictive about who is allowed to donate blood.  I wonder if the reality of it has more to do with them having about as much donated as they are willing or able to process.  So they don't really want more donors.  I don't know.  It takes money to process it.  But processing it involves the production of products like anti-body treatments and the anti-bodies that they harvest from the blood donations can be sold.  So there is money to be made on those kills.  So to speak.  There were also concerns, I had thought, about purchasing medical treatments from India and nations that were not upholding of their people's right not to donate.  I mean to say, there are concerns around nations like New Zealand being limited or restricted in being able to purchase, for example, antibody treatments from India that may have  been obtained by vulnerable people (people kept vulnerable) who did not give informed consent.  Because, you know, if someone is an antibody factory then why not hook them up on a ventillator and take as much blood for them for antibody treatments for everyone else as you can get away with?  I mean to say, morality in New Zealand land involves the one being sacrificed for the team of 5 million.  So, it wouldn't really be responsible for anybody to purchase medical treatments and the like that had been developed in New Zealand.  Since the most basic of the ethics is sorely lacking...  Anyway...  I think we were getting blood products from India at some point.  I remember reading that there were concerns about how the treatments had been collected or developed.  And I thought to myself..  It isn't like we do things any differently here, though, is it?  I remember reading the high court case judgment about the person who did not consent for his relatives organs to be donated for transplant.  And they took them anyway.  Transplanted them anyway.  I am trying to remember who that particular surgeon and surgical team was...  What the consequences were for them?  If they needed to move along and go steal people's organs in the Australian Outback or whether they could just keep on keeping on in a major urban centre of New Zealand.  Don't forget:  There is no alternative.  THey won't process applications (for enrolment or employment) from anybody else.  Only game in town.</p>

                                <p>I don't know...  But I think Twitter was about AI.  Artificial Intelligence.  Training the Twitter Bots to appear as intelligent as a person who tweats.  About as intelligent as a twit.  A twitter user.  Tweater.  Whathaveyou.  Anway...  I think the estimates were that around 1/3rd the population of Twitter were Twitterbots.  Artificial intelligence programmes.  There supposed to take information from people, primariliy, but also each other, I guess, and imitate.  Copy.  Variation.  Innovation.  Creativity.  Whatever.  Anyway...  Then you could see how successful the AI was when you see how many people are choosing the Twitterbots rather than the actual people.  Anyway..  I guess what happened was that political leaders ended up following the Twitter Bots more than they ended up being responsive to their own populations of atcual people.  I mean to say the Twitter Bots ended up training the peple to be indistinguishable to a Twitter Bot.  Most people think that AI is cheating when it pulls people down to it's level.  I mean to say, a computer programme taht is indistinguishable from a person in virtue of having incapacitatted a person is cheating. </p>

                                <p>There was a post-modernist essay generator quite a while back...  That would generate a gramatically correct output with actual words but it appeared to be nonense.  THey called it post-modernist becuase of how for people who hadn't been trained in or taught in the field (or similar) there were all these words that nobody really knew what they meant.  So you sort of chain them together into complex sentences and who knows what's  been said.  But the grading grinder (AI grading programmes) if they weren't deciding the grades on the basis of what race the student was, what the post-code of their parents home address was, whether they paid 'donations' or 'bribes' to Crimson Education etc etc...  The grading progarmmes could, for example, grade work on the basis of whether there were any typos or gramatical errors.  I mean to say the AI grading algorithm could give highest grading marks to the essays that had been AI generated.  So that the computer programmes could be programmes to preferentially select for computer programmes else people who could easily pass themselves off for being a computer programme so they could be fired, I suppose, and replaced by computer programmes in the very near future.  In other words..  Exterminate (flunk out) all the people who are not indisctinguishable from computer programmes.  Then when people are used to seeing tha tpeople are trained to act indistinguishably from computer programmes fire the peple.  Get rid of the payroll to and for them.  Replace them with computer progarmmes for real.  Why not?  Isn't that a great idea?</p>

                                <p>So, lets see.  Computer programmes could write hte laws for a country.  That's a good idea.  They could write all the research outputs of the university.  All of the research.  All of the independent inquiries.  All of the judges judgements.  What else could the computer progarmmes do...  They could write the speeches of the leaders.  They could write all the plays and the poems and all of the arts.  I wonder if you could have an entire nation run by artificial intelligence progammes and if anybody would be able to tell...  If anybody would know...  Hey, I know, let's make the nasty little despot of New Zealand a test case!  What a wonderful terrific idea/l!   </p>

                                <p>So there is going to be an inquiry into discovery.  What they mean to say, is that they are refusing to prosecute government officials for obstruction of justice whe the government officials refuse to hand over documents that are needed for the other party to have the information that they need to file with the courts.  For example, refusing to supply public health records to people whose records they are else to family members of people who were declared dead by the public health system of New Zealand.  They intentionally withhold the records so as to obstruct justice.  They intentionally withhold the health records that are very highly likely to contain evidence of the crimes of the New Zealand government employees against the people of New Zealand.  One can only imagine or suppose that a pre-requisite for a job in the records office is actually to prevent and prohibit and confuse and obstruct.  I mean, Una Jagose, herself, was instructing New Zealand Government employees to throw away evidence of abuse by Government employees.  Right?  She was intentionally ordering the destruction of evidence.  They pay her half a million dollars per year in order to ensure that instead of instructing Crown Law to prosecute the crimes of the Government employees they throw away evidence of their crimes.  Not even the teeniest tinyiest hint of 'try'.  Hey.  I mean...  Can it really be that they are this incompetent?  This stupid?  Or is the better explanation that something quite entirely different is going on...  Where is Una Jagose?  Where did she go with her millions?  </p>
