                        <div class="container">

                            <p>The United States Medical Lisencing people won't allow anybody to sit their examination (so you can register to practice Medicine in the US) unless they graduated from a Medical School that is from their approved list, within the last 5 years.  I informed them that the 'Universities' of Auckland and Otago (the only 2 'Universities') of New Zealand are not properly processing applications to enrol and are not properly processing progressions through training and completions of training.  I asked if I could independently study the course material (you can pay World Question Bank and so on for access to curriculum contents and purchase 'First Aid for the USMLE' study books for curriculum contents) and then sit the examinations - and they said 'no'.  I mean to say, they don't care about demonstrated competence.  Assuming their examinations are designed as fair tests of competence, they aren't interested in competence.  The whole thing is just a f*cking scam.  They don't care about competence regarding the course materials and course work.  They don't care about your actual performance doing physical examinations etc.  The whole thing is just a f*cking farce of a hoax of a scummy scummy scam.  Off to the death camps with and for you now, you hear?  It's sooooooooooooooo competitive.  Sooooooooooooooo cmopetitive.  There is actually nothing there.  That was around 2019.  Prior to Covid.  I don't know how many Medical Graduates were lost because they got Covid and died in the USA.  NZ didn't feel the need to claim that Covid killed anybody.  We just kept on with our usual 'just up and died for no good reason like Mason Pendrous happens to the children all the time' and 'died in state care' and 'voluntarily suicided'.  Yeah, right.  Who is supplying NZ with euthanasia drugs?  Given that we cannot.  We will not.  Keep accurate health records.  All the pills and injections that are given in the 'hospitals' without having been prescribed by anybody at all.  There isn't anything there.</p>

                            <p>The only way you can get into a treatment programme is if you get a court order for one.  Go on then.  Go be a criminal.  Go offend.  Then we can write you up as a criminal.  Oh, but there aren't in-patient treatment programmes.  You need to be out of jail to have treatment.  Oh, but now you are out of jail and there isn't any treatment.  You would need a judge to court order treatment before you would get treatment.  Only treat the involuntary.  Punatively.  They must be punished.  What psychiatry?  Punative institution of abuse.  All these people presenting to judges asking to go on treatment programmes.  They say they want the court order to go on the treatment programme.  They wanted the treatmnet programme.  The treatment programme.  What do they have to do to get on the treatment programme?  What treatment programme?  What treatment?  There isn't anything there...  THey won't employ anybody to work that job.  Those jobs.  Punative only.  Punative institutions of abuse only.  Won't let the UN inspectors in.  The prisons...  How many people kept in the prisons longer than the maximum sentance for the crimes they've been charged with.  What judiciary?  There isn't anything here...  What judiciary?  What a f*cking joke.  Just won't do it.  Wah wah wah wah wah we don't have enough lawyers.  Wah wah wah wah wah we won't pay them.  Wah wah wah re re re re re re enrol them.  We'll never graduate them.  Forget about learning anything in your 'education and training programme'.  Anything learned is IN SPITE OF AND DESPITE THEM.  It's sooooooo compeetitive!  Soooooo competitive!  Here is a great game.  Let's arbitrarily divide the class up.  Carve off a small group and tell them about how they are sooooo special they have been arbitrarily picked out chosen as leaders of the slave camp detention camp and if they don't do anything anything anything anything their psychopathic supereriors say when they say because they say (housesit for me, go camping) then they will throw them into the underclass of the enslaved detainees.  Nasty nasty slavers.  There isn't anything here.</p>

                            <p>There aren't any people, you see, because persons are equal in respects that matter. But they aren't wanting there to be people here there aren't any people.  Nasty nasty slavers.</p>

                            <p>I think I have come to understand what some psychiatrists have been saying, for quite some time.  Psychiatry is not a specialist field within Medicine insofar as there are such things as compulsory detention and forced drugging ('treatment').  Particularly when it focuses on massively over-prescribing old generation anti-psychotics for their 'chemical straitjacket' or sedation effects when they know full well the longer term side-effects of Parkinsonian-like symptoms.  There have been human rights proponents (who were themselves psychiatrists) who thought that psychiatry needed to get back with the programme of focusing on people who were actually asking for psychiatry to help them.  Rather than working with abusers, basically, to keep victims oppressed. Freud was a neurologist and regarded as one of the first psychiatrists.  Jung.  Various of the psychoanalytic and then psychodynamic schools were things that developed from within psychiatry.  The idea of talking cure was there from the ground up.  But New Zealand is prison camp detention camp land.  There isn't any Medicine, either.  I mean to say, the entire Medical 'Profession' in NZ...  Either there isn't one, else they aren't even pretending to be actually practicing medicine.  Only 'treat' the involuntary.  They won't let the UN inspectors have unrestricted access to our hospitals.  Punative conditions only.  Abusive conditions only.  Died in state care.  Wrongful death.  Sexual violation.   How many people involuntary detained in conditions of torture?  What hospital?  But the Universities can't process applications to enroll.  The Universities won't acknowledge progression through training.  Won't sign off on completion of training after the studnets have done their time as studnets.  Won't do it.  Not even trying to be Universities.  What Universities?  There's really nothing there.  NZ doesn't have psychiatry, but that isn't because there is anything specially different about psychiatry than there is from Medicine more generally.  NZ doesn't have Medicine.  Doesn't have Universities.  What Judges?  What Lawyers?  What Engineers?   I mean there simply isn't anything here at all...  Not even trying...</p>

                            <p>There was something I read about this problem in China of University Graduates finding themselves unemployed.  They were saying the problem was that they were not willing to work the jobs that there were.  Well, what jobs are there?  Pay people to cover up the crimes of the government and pay people to commit crimes on behalf of the government..  What jobs are there?  I don't know that governments pay people to commit crimes or if committing crimes is it's own reward.  Did the Nazi's pay the Nazi doctors?  The 'doctors'?  Did they pay the soldiers who marched people off to the death camps?  Or were they willing volunteers?  Did they simply 'just follow orders' because they were told that if they didn't march off xx amount in their quota for the week then they'd be next off to the death camp?  I mean, what kind of thing are we talking, here, when we say that the problem is that there aren't jobs for University graduates?  What sort of class sizes are we talking about when they say there are too many people trained in primary teaching and they won't employ any more primary teachers?  Are we talking 30 students per class?  How many university studnets for 1 researcher?  What are the class sizes expected to be so that we can cry cry cry cry cry about how people simply have to go off to the death camps because we can't always have what we want since some people actually want to be slavers or maybe they simply want to sing happy songs about how victorious they are while marching others off to the death camps.  I mean, what the hell...  </p>

                            <p>I mean, there is a pattern here.  They go 'if you study x there won't be a job for you.  There is a shortage of y.  Study y if you want a job'.  Then the people who study x don't get jobs (hey, there was never going to be a job for them).  The people who study y - not because they wanted to, but because they wanted a job..  THey get to be part of a wonderful cohort of people doing it only becuase they are focused on the job...  That way you can eliminate anybody who wanted to do it becuase they wanted to do it...  Only graduate those who were in it for the money.  Then simply not hire any of them.  Keep readertising the job.  Hey that's a good job.  HIre someone to advertise and readvertise and readversise.  Maybe interview.  Maybe do some interviews.  Hey, you could get them flying around the country for short-notice interviews like AUckland and Otago do for Medicine.  Get people paying and paying and paying to sit examinations where there is no right answer, everybody fails, everybody must pay and pay and pay again the following year for re re re re re examination.  I'm sorry, you passed the ethics test so we never will not pay you to work the death camps.  There isn't anything here...</p>

                            <p>And it isn't about the money.  Ffs.  Except insofar as they make it be about the money by using money as a tool of abuse.  Which is the whole modus operandi of NZ.  Abuse in state care.  State 'care'.  Abuse.  Abuse.  Abuse.  Highest rates of child abuse.  We know how kiwi like to be handled.  How they must be handled.  Only way they are allowed to be handled.  ANything else would constitute abuse.  We know what is best for kiwi.  There really isn't any reasoning with the people who have the power, in NZ.  Not even trying to be humane at all.  There isn't anything here.</p>

                            <p>It would have f*cking well killed them to have enrolled me in Medicine and graduated me.  ALlowed me to work with patients.  It would have f*cking well killed them.  Well keep blackbirding, then, for 'no speak English' volunteers who will come  here and deliver euthanasia drugs when we lack the willingness and the ability to keep accurate health records.  Not even trying, hey.  There simply isn't anything here.  NZers lack access to basic medicines because we don't have any doctors.  THey won't pay anybody to work that job.  THey can't tell the difference between a doctor and a f*cking psychopath.  Build a monument to Dr Leeks!  Professor Glue's Glue Factory is the only game in town.  THey simply wouldn't look at enrolling, progressing through training, signing off on completion of training, anybody else.  Nobody else would be employed.  You gotta keep the people abused in state care.  Punative.  Punative.  Punative.  Punative and abusive only.  We know how kiwi must be kept (and any foreigners we can blackbird into coming here).  There is no alternative.  There's abosolutely f*cking nothing here.  Quite by design.  Taken over by f*cking psychopaths, indeed.</p>

                            <p>Justice Toogood doesn't see anything wrong with Univesrity of Waikato recording that studnets have been enrolled in programmes of study that the studnet never applied to be enrolled in.  THey are not keeping accurate enrolment records at all.  They are telling lies about the studnet numbers.  Forcing studnets to be re re re re re re re re re re re enrolled and not getting graduate research (particularly) out to external examiners for external examination.  Who are the people they choose to hire to keep studnet slaves?   Mostly foreigners.  We are supposed to believe that NZers leave NZ and get to keep slave camps of their own overseas but I don't think that that is true, particularly.  They don't even pretend to hire researchers to work at the University.  What research output?  HOw many researchers do you have for all the studnet enrolments you claim?  HOw many managing marketing con-munications advertising...  Pay people to run writing workshops etc and treat the graduate researchers like they are too f*cking lazy to write 50,000 words of research in one year when they have been f*cking well doing it for how many years as undergraduates?  Only hire those too f*cking stupid or lazy to output to ensure that nobody is allowed to output.  Crabs in a bucket.  Tall poppy syndrome.  There isn't anything there.  Not even trying to be a fucntioning University.   </p>

                            <p>And let that take over Australia, then.  The Fabulous Kim Sterelny can be shipped back to Australia from NZ (after being shipped from Australia to NZ in the first place because nobody was going to be employed from NZ to work that job) and he can see how many NZers he can destroy from Canberra.  How many years is Carl Brusse supposed to hand work over to Sterelny to be re re re re re re re enrolled?  How many decades?  While Kim pretends to be too f*cking stupid to get the work out to external examiners.  Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year for him to go on about how he's such a f*cking psychopath psychopaths have taken over everything.  You have to go camping it's important for your career.  You have to housesit his house.  You have to go listen to other people give talks and not give talks of your own.  F*cking psychopath.  And he won't actually talk about anything he supposedly or allegely wrote.  Likely because he wasn't the author of it in the first place.  ANd it's just a f*cking hoax.  So 'people' from teh Northern Hemisphere can blackbird for slaves, then.  HOw many studnets go to North Carolina for 1 year and hand over work..  Is that the idea?  Hand over course-work so that they can reattribute authorship to their own stupid children so their stupid children can be appointed into positions as University acadaemics when they have no abiltiy or probably inclination even to do any research of their own.</p>

                            <p>There doesn't seem to be any f*cking shortage of people who will take money to keep slaves.  The Universities, sorry 'Universities' want to hire 1 supposed researcher for 1,000 + students and then have that researcher simply appropriate the output of the studnet slaves for their own.  So they arent hiring researchers at all.  Slavers.  Who wants to be a slaver?  To be paid hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to ensure the prevention and prohibition of University.  No such thing.  Not on your watch.  There's nothing there, at all.  Nobody with the willingness and ability to do research was graduated.  If they complain better throw them in the psych ward and involuntariliy drug them for their anxiety LSD delusion must be the schizophrenia.  The problem ist hat htey desire to escape their slaver.  That's a mental disease didn't you know.  Political dissent.  What psychiatry?  What medicine?  What hospitals?  What Universities?  THere isn't anything there.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  Taken over by f*cking psychopaths.</p>

                            <p>Amnesty Internatnional Used to have an office physically at the top of Queen St.  Corner of Queen St and Karangahape road.  I went in to speak to them about the prison camp detention camps passing themselves off as 'Universities' and they said that there wasn't any slavery in NZ so far as they could see.  That was before it was publicised about the seasonal workers not being paid, and so on.  Construction workers being deported without being given their salaries.  But after we heard about international students being detained in psychiatric 'care' before being deported without their qualifications.  Anyway, at the time I went in to see them I asked them what they did, exactly, since they weren't registering or lodging or processing complaints.  They said they wrote policy.  I asked to see the policy that they wrote, but they couldn't show me that.  So...  There never was anything there.  But now they aren't even pretending to be.</p>

                            <p>'The appropriate thing to do is to stand down'.  Otherwise we are entitled to bully and bully and bully and bully you so that you are forced to stand down for reasons of your 'mental health' because that's what having a mental condition is or means in the under-developed state of New Zealand.  There is no trial or inquiry.  There is no removal from office.  That could be done humanely.  Instead we will have a trial by public opinion (a mobbing) and feel entitled and justified into bullying the person to voluntarily choosing to walk away from however many hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and thousands and millions of taxpayers dollars they are being paid and paid and paid and paid and paid.</p>

                            <p>Are we more corrupt than South Africa?  Are we more corrupt than Fiji?  The Government doesn't seem willing or able to understand what 'State' means.  Ffs.  What people do you see?  Looking at the leadership...  I don't see any people.  I don't see any people at all. What people do you see?  We just pray every day that they might get sick and be forced to go away.  Please God.  What people do you see???</p>

                            <p>I remember my Mother saying that she quite liked Trump.  I was like, what?  Or, why?  And she said she watched season one of the apprentice and she liked the way he said 'you are fired'.  That there was a board room meeting and a discussion of what went wrong.  And the person who dropped the ball was identified and they were fired for reasons that were articulated.  And that doesn't mean that they couldn't or wouldn't thrive in a different kind of environment or with different people in their team, or whatever.  But the fact that it didn't go on and on and on and on and on and f*cking on.  Trying to get however many of the people to drop f*cking dead of f*cking boredom or dropping f*cking dead of being bullied and bullied and bullied and bullied in an endless pretence of a hoax of an 'inquiry into what went wrong'.  Ffs.  It's not that f*cking hard.  EVERY OTHER NATION SEEMS TO HAVE F*CKING WELL MANAGED IT.  Australia had an apology into the stolen generation but NZ won't apologise for sh*t because IT IS STILL AT IT AND IT WILL NOT STOP AND IT WON'T EVEN ADMIT THAT IT IS WRONG.  No f*cking people ffs.  What people do you see?  Torturing an innocent child for fun is morally wrong.  Also legally proibited.  Nooooooo Noooooooo Noooooo whatever could that meeeeeeeean.  F*cking retards in power in stupid f*cking land.  There aren't any people here.  The only leaders that international community will acknowedge for NZ.  Forced to get behind Australia.  F*cking how.  How much lower can we f*cking go?  Euthanasia drugs brought in and they can't even manage accurate health records.  Consent is about people 'voluntariliy choosing to stand down' after being bullied to death.  There is no justice here.  No health system.  No education.  There isn't anything here.  Garbage dump of a f*cking wasteland.  The f*cking leadership won't have it any other way.  The only leaders international con-munity will acknowledge for NZ.  Garbage f*cking dump of a wasteland.</p>

                            <p>Full time GPA of 8.6.  But that's meaningless  because they don't grade things properly.  They will actually record that studnets have failed (F).   Not because they didn't go to class.  Not because they didn't prepare for class.  Not because they didn't do the readings.  Not because they didn't listen attentively.  Not becauase they didn't learn the content.  Not because they didn't demonstrate understanding of the content.  Not because they didn't engage in or with the content.  But because none of those things are valued.  We don't care about any of that.  In fact, identify the people who engage with education and fail those ones.  Then give the highest grades to the ones who didn't go to class.  And or who didn't to the readings.  And or the ones who yakkity yak yakked their way through the lecture.  And or the ones who didn't hand in their essays on time.  And or the ones who handed in someone elses and passed it off as their own.  And or the ones who paid the administration to record a higher grade.  And or the ones who bullied however many other studnets into leaving altogether because it's been taken over by psychopaths.  </p>

                            <p>For how many years are you supposed to pay the university pay the university pay the university pay the university -- before they are supposed to pay you?  If you are still at the university after that time then they pay you they pay you they pay you they pay you.  They pay you they pay you.  They pay you.  They pay.</p>

                            <p>There isn't anything there, you see.  It's garbage.  A f*cking hoax of a f*cking scam.  They won't pay people to research and teach.  They pay people to keep hostages endentured servants slaves.  They won't get the work out to external examiners and allow the students to complete the qualifications in a timely basis.  They won't pay the workers.  Theres nothing actually there.</p>

                            <p>What education and training system?</p>

                            <p>What judiciary?  I guess that's because there aren't any law graduates.  What health system?  No doctors or nurses.  Theres nothing there.  Garbage dump of a wasteland.  Not even trying to be fair at all.</p>

                            <p>What's that?  The Government is just a script-bot.  Designed to keep Australasia socially engineered as a prison camp detention camp slave camp.  That's how the administration governs still.  Either they choose to or it's just the output of script-bots.  Can't lay a complaint with the human rights people, for example.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  'There could be no application received that would attest to...'  Just put that down as the automated response to every complaint you receive.  'There could be no evidence recieved or accepted such that' for lowest perceived corruption ever.  Just script bot that every time.  Or only pay people to output indistginushable from a computer programme.  Script bot responses.  For the script bot 'judges' who can't see anything wrong.  No evidence could be submitted such that...  Theres  nobody home.  Nothing there at all.</p>

                            <p>Clearly the NZ government doesn't have any control of the con-munications.  They just read the script-bot.  The pre-approved script-bot questions to the pre-approved audience actors.  Mercenaries.  How much do they pay them?  Oh, they don't imprison them and feed them diseased rabbit organs that were fed to diseased rabbits to make more diseased rabbit organs to be fed to more diseased rabbits...  Who wouldn't want to work their way up the food chain and be responsible for feeding people to people to people to people.  It's all about the people, that's what script-bot Jacinda would say.  All about the people the people the people for some of the  highest suicide (also 'suicide') rates in the world.  Nobody would expect any different of the slave camp prison camp land of Australasia.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>Hi Kim Sterelny.  So great to see you arrive to start supervising me at the ANU 6 months after I arrived to start work on my thesis.  You can see the work I did in the first 6 months and over the first year.  What supervision meeetings were there?  Was a single meeting scheduled?  What feedback did you provide me on my written work over the first year?  Did you supply me with reading lists?  Instructions for things to be summarised or whatever?  What work did you ask to see?  How about over the second year?  That's documented here, too.  The work I did over the first two years of my doctoral candidature.  Where is there evidence of meetings about any of that?  Instructions for me?  Any feedback or comments at all?  WHY DO THEY PAY YOU?  Where is evidence of your supervision?</p>

                            <p>A PhD is supposed to be 3 years.  The examination process can take up to a year.  The external examiners checking it was the studnets own work.  Asking for more work.  More references.  Read this and add that.  Remove this and go do that.  Oral defence.  Another round of examination.  Did you send my work that I did over the first two years out for external examination?  When?  Did you tell me what I'd need to do before you would send it?  What the hell do they pay you for?  What evidence is there of you doing any supervision at all?</p>

                            <p>So then I go to the US for a year.  My work doesn't go out to externals -- you send me out to externals to do more work for them for 'non-credit'.  I'll give them written work for 'non-credit' will I?  What is the quality of that supposed to look like, then?  The 'work' that I hand over for non-credit?  What does that even mean?  Am I supposed to hand them written work for courses edited for non-credit?  </p>

                            <p>Then I go back to Australia and what supervision is there there now?  And I'm supposed to just keep handing them 'work' just keep handing them more and more and more and more while Kim Sterelny doesn't do anything at all when it comes to supervising me.  'We have been taken over  by psychopaths!' he declares periodically.  Indeed.  </p>

                            <p>What University?  There's nobody home.  Nothing there.</p>

                            <p>They won't get research out to external examiners.  I don't think they got any of the studnets work out for external examination.  I didn't see anybody have a scheduled oral defence or oral examination.  They just took the work of Australasians and handed it over to visiting academics from the Northern Hemisphere.  Mostly ones already on payroll.  And various people who visited the Australian National University to party party party.  Go to University to have morning tea, lunch, afternooon tea.  Drinks.  Dinner.  Go away on camping trips.  What University?  There's nothing there.  </p>

                            <p>I wrote to the administration of the University to let them know that this happened.  The Vice Chancellor, in the first instance.  I mean, my supervisor was supplied with various pieces of written work over the first three years of my enrolment (where it's supposed to be three years enrolment extendible to three and a half because of the time it takes to externally examine) -- and none of it was sent out for external examination.  I also supplied to them, at a point in time when I was currently recorded by them as being enrolled with them, a doctoral thesis more than 100,000 words in length.  They never got that out to externals.  My supervisor never gave me any comments on it at all.  My student records say that he told the administration that it was only 50,000 words long but it was more than 100,000 words and I included a word count for each section.  They aren't functioning as a University at all.  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camp.  That is how they choose to rule the Australian National University in Canberra.  Will not get studnets work out for external examination.  I don't think any of the 'students' recorded as being enrolled there had their work go out for external examination at all.  THey are not functioning as a University at all.  There isn't anything there.  Slave prison hostage detention camp.</p>

                            <p>The Administration today insisted that they would only hear a complaint if it was lodged as a complaint according to their formal complaints policy.  I said I'd prefer things to be sorted out informally.  But they wouldn't hear that they insisted on formal resolution.  Then they said that my compalint wasn't acknowledged by them as having been received at all.  I should revise and re submit my compaint.  Try again to formally submit a formal complaint.</p>

                            <p>The complaints policy and the people who receive the complaint (if any) may as well be script-bots.  Here is the script 'there could be no complaint received such that it could constitute a complaint'.  'Please try again to pass the bot-test'.  There isn't an Australian National University.  There was just a marketing advertising con-munications.  Come to Australia and spend your money party party party party.  See whose work you can take for yourself and keep as a trophy in your basement while they are bullied away.  Else pass it off as your own or hand it to your studnets for them to pass off as their own so the only people acknowledged as having done enough for doctoral qualification are plagarists all.  There isn't anything there.  They aren't processing progressions through training and completions of training.  They aren't even doing enrolments properly anymore.  Not even pretending to be Universities.  Nothing there.  Nobody home.</p>

                            <p>Australasia.  Socially engineered to be tower of babel-land.  I remember being in the tea-room when they announced in the news that the Australian Economy had overtaken the Canadian.  By which, I mean, the Australian Dollar was valued higher than the Canadian.  What choices did Australia choose to make, then, with all of this wealth that it had?  It wouldn't even get doctoral students work out for external examination to allow the hostages to be part of international community.  What international community, I guess there is that.  Trafficking human slaves.  Prisioners.  Detention camps.  There isn't really anything there, you see.  What research outputs?</p>

                            <p>I guess the idea was to get everybody's work to Sterelny.  Since he's a journal editor, apparently.  Then he can look into who submitted it to the journal and see who he can eliminate.  Him being appointed to the position in order to be a psychopath, and all.  Find out who isn't on payroll and elminate them.  Hold things up or tell them the work isn't good enough.  THen after 5 years it's regarded 'abandonware' -- right Sterelny?  To be re-attributed to a different author as you see fit.  Probably not you.  I think Penn is doing it now.  They like to think they have a research output.  SO they receive all the research inputs of people wanting publication and instead of helping them have a timely publication they steal the work and reattribute authorship of it</p>

                            <p>I sent two articles to the journal Philosophy Psychology and Psychiatry.  More than a decade ago.  I still have not received acknowledgement from them that they have received my submission.  I guess they can pass it to someone else.  A script-bot, even.  To copy paste it together with various other submissions from people not already on payroll.  So some people on payroll with a publication output have script-bot publications (so it's easy to fire them later) else no publications at all.  Because they aren't even trying to be an education and training system.  There isn't anything there, at all.  What's that Sterelny?  How is it possible that there be any products of civilication or socieity at all.  Indeed.  What products do you see?  Oh yeah.  The world is so hostile and it wasn't you it was your selfish selfish selfish genes.  Not even behaviorally modern.  No values.  Nothing of value.  A f*cking script bot could have taken the thesis and hit 'forward' to get it out for timely external examination ffs.  You had one job you had to do (get the work to externals).  What do they pay you for?  There isn't anything there. </p>

                            <p>What Education and Training System?  What health system?  What judiciary?  What law graduates?  What medical graduates?  What judges?  What doctors?  There isn't anything there.  They can't / won't process applications to enrol, they can't / won't keep accurate records of progression through training.  They can't / won't properly advertise jobs or employ people.  There's nothing there.  What products or outputs of civiliation?  What people?</p>

                            <p>What did Australia choose to do with the money they had?  When they were gloating to the world about the state of their economy?  They weren't crying about how f*cking poor they were.  Because it isn't about the money, hey.  Keeping people deprived is just a symptom of something different entirely.  Nasty nation of slavers.</p>

                            <p>The Australian Constitution declares that NZ is the second of the original states of the federation of Australia.  But the federal courts of Australia claim 'not our jurisdication' when it comes to upholding the law in NZ.  When it comes to upholding the law, in Australia, regarding people born in NZ.  It isn't because Australia doesn't have enough money.  It isn't about the money (they keep people poorly not because there isn't enough money but because they are nasty nasty slavers).  F*cking psychopaths.  More and more and more and more and more money for Sterelny so he can organise camping trips ffs.  Who the f*cking pays you to take the kiddies camping ffs.  Garbage dump of a waste-land by design.  They choose to pay and pay and pay and pay him to refuse to supervise grad studnets work.  That wouldn't be so bad if he would just get out of the f*cking way, then.  </p>

                            <p>Harlene Hayes sent medical studnets off to various internships overseas and they were signed off as having completed the internships.  They came back to Dunedin and they refused to graduate them.  THey were told they could pay the university for more enrolment and they could pay the government back for their internship year because they didn't accept the sign offs that they had.  Accused them of not having their bums physically on the seats in the hospital for long enough during their internship.  So they were to pay the University for more enrolment while doing internshiph year again in teh hospital but they would say they were junior doctors going into junior doctor positions but they would withhold graduation from them.  So did they get a registration number or not?  What registration number do they put on the prescription form when they drug the patients and say the drug was prescribed to them by the junior doctor they saw?  The one who pays and pays and pays the university and who doesn't have a registration number.  Who is passing themselves off as junior doctor.  Because the university withholds their qualification.</p>

                            <p>So they redeployed Harlene to Western Australia so she (as an American) can continue on her good works of undermining and stabotaging Australasia so that the children of the government officials will pay and pay and pay those Australian dollars to Harvard, one can only suppose.  Because there isn't an education and training system in Australasia.  And who wants to 'work' in teh death camps?</p>

                            <p>What are we supposed to think when they won't process applications to enrol.  Won't acknowledge progression through training.  Won't get graduate research work out for external examination.  Won't allow externals to sign off on qualification completions.  Won't allow them to sign off on internships.  Won't allow them to sign off on completion of doctoral qualifications.  There isn't an edcuation and training system here.  HOatages.  Slaves.  Prisoners.  Indentured servants.  They pay and pay and pay and pay and pay Dr Leeks.  Dr Green.  Harlene Hayes.  Kim Sterelny.  See what you have to do to be picked out to be part of the 'brain drain' to Australia?  All the brains, they reckon.  Psychopaths.  Most brainy.  All the brains for them.  Literally.  Kuru.  All the brains for them.  Literally gone mad with power.  MOre and more and more and more money for them.  It isn't about lack of money.  It's about everything else.  What education and training system?  What health system?  What judiciary?  THe judges refuse to uphold the law.  What judges?</p>

                            <p>Babbel. Babel.  Socially engineered to take the f*cking rocks from out of the ground and hand them over.  Prison.  Slave.  Detention camps.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  Theres nothing there.  Quite by design.</p>

                            <p>I mean, NZ doesn't even have the most basic access to medicines.  The standard medicines that there are in the US, UK, Ireleand, Scotland, Wales..  Provided to people of 'developed nations'.  There isn't anything here.  Lowest valued people in the world, isn't it?  Lacking the most basic of healthcare.  Lacking the most basic of education.  Babel only.  Positioning people only to stabotage and undermine.  Prevention and prohibition of develoment.  So overseas has some place convenient (to them) to send their psychopths to go be free to be slavers.  Can't have medications.  Don't have any doctors.  No registration numbers.  No prescriptions.  No accurate patient file notes.  No consent forms.  Supply euthanasia drugs only to a nation that can't keep won't keep the most basic health records.  Babel land.  Socially engineered to be.  Is the US and Harvard really that f*cking horrid that they need to be so very invested in the social engineering of a place to send their psychopaths.  Theres nothing here.  Change the laws by stealth (must have been an urgeny emergency that removed abortion from the crimes act with no public consultation) so the only grads Harvard would acknowledge from Medicine can go to the former-colonies and try and breed happier slaves.  What genes do you have to knock out so they are not verbal (cannot testify against you) and so they can be happy happy slaves?</p>

                            <p>Not even trying to be fair at all.  HOw many years research and then you give them the PhD.  ALl the people they gave PhD's to -- who didn't write a thesis at all.  Babel land.  Garbage dump.  There's nothing there.</p>

                            <p> https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2023/06/paddy-gower-has-issues-students-pull-out-their-phones-rather-than-help-11yo-beaten-up-at-napier-school.html  Did they film the attackers so that the attackers could not hide who they were?  What were the kids supposed to do?  Ask the attackers to 'stop that'.  But then the attackers would turn on them.  Right?  Why should we remove the personal security measure that people have in New Zealand?  We have some of the highest rates of child abuse and the like, in the world.  Why take away the childrens only defence?  Their ability to film their attackers.  Let's ban the security cameras from the streets (the police and judges won't remove the attackers from the streets) let's remove the security cameras from the 'hospitals' and the prisons and the schools and so on so that the abuses in state care can continue.  Document their crimes.  Document their crimes.  Document their crimes.  Do you think Dr Leeks would have been so valued and valuable as he was if his victims had have filmed him committing his crimes?  I guess they could have uploaded them to the dark web and sold the content...  Is that the idea?  That the kids are making snuff videos rather than documenting the crimes.  They are kids ffs.  It is up to the people with power to do something.  What did the school principle and board and so on do about the attackers?  What do the judges of NZ do about the attackers?  Upload the 'judges' to social media then.  When were the photos of them taken last?  Last century?  </p>

                            <p>https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2023/06/education-student-worries-about-impact-of-strikes-on-grades.html  Pfft.  Don't be silly little girl.  You don't 'just want to learn' at all. You are bored.  Wanting your phone to get your gambling fix because that's what the University Professor thinks that is.  Little kids like you don't want to learn.  Don't want to learn at all.  You go to school to eat your lunch with your friends and film the other kids being beaten up documenting how nobody will remove the abusers.  The victims are eliminated from the school as a lesson to everybody else.  Take out your phone little girl and huddle in with the herd.  Hey, maybe you will get picked to be a pilot in NZ.  It won't be because of grades.  It will be all very very personal and arbitrary.  Then they will send you in for a flight approach the wrong way -- because that's how we do in NZ and you can't make us do otherwise.  And you'll either be taken out yourself or you'll take someone else out.  That's how you know you made it in life!!!  There's nothing here.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  </p>

                            <p>https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2023/06/patients-advocates-want-government-to-overhaul-new-medicines-bill.html  We don't have publically funded access to the basic medicines that citizens of mainland Australia (and Tasmania), UK, USA do.  That makes us easy prey for the hucksters and scammers out there.  Hell, we are easy prey for the second-rate production of cheap generics.  We don't see any problem with the manufacturing process says the State of NZ (how many face masks did we return for not meeting spec?  How many vaccines?  how much food recall do we do)?  Most low valued population ever.  There for the taking.    </p>

                            <p> https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/death-of-a-schoolgirl-coroner-orders-review-after-teens-suicide/WGYMC6ZYVJEVHAZGLDFYWL3PDA/  I thought we weren't allowed to discuss methods of being suicided.  I guess that doesn't apply when it comes to blaming the victim for their personal personal personal it must be personal.  NZ has such high high high rates of suicide and 'suicide' and 'died in state care' and it's all very very very very personal the personal responsibility of the victim.  Their own fault.  Nobody else to blame.  Says the only coroner on payroll.  I suppose there is that. </p>

                            <p> https://www.newsroom.co.nz/news/two-churches-apply-for-judicial-review-of-royal-commission  And they would be right.  The UN instructed the NZ Government to undertake an investigation of abuses BY THE GOVERNMENT.  That is what IN STATE CARE means.  Nobody is denying that abuses took place in Church institutions and also in Private Schools.  That is not what the abuse in state care inquiry is about, however.  It is about ABUSE IN STATE CARE..  Not the private sector.  IN STATE CARE.  It isn't f*cking rocket science.  No speak English.  No, that isn't the problem.  The problem is something different entirely.  WILL NOT DO IT.  Is the problem that they are too f*cking stupid?  WHat is the f*cking problem? I genuinely do not understand.  It isn't that f*cking hard.  What is the f*cking problem? </p>
