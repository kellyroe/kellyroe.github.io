                              <a href="writing/gogoethics.png" target="_self">Who wants to do their very very best to cause or induce cardiovascular disease in pacific island people (in the name of `equity targets', no doubt)?  </a> 



                              <p>
                                  I wonder how many applications they will get for that one.  I wonder how many people will actually pay the 'University' (bring external sources of funding with them) in order to murder death kill pacific islanders.  I wonder how it gets through the ethics board.  Do you?
                              </p>

                              <p>Or maybe it's a phoney ad, and they got hacked.  Or maybe not.  I mean...  This is the only kind of reseach the government will fund, or something?  How was it that Dr Leeks was payrolled for however many years and then moved to Melbourne to better facilitate his ongoing crimes?  How could that be?  Oh, but it isn't any different from what various other people on payroll are up to.  And that is precisely why they payroll them.  Isn't that right?</p>

                              <p>See, we start with abusing rats.  Or maybe insects, and then rats. Then move our way up the great hierarchy of being.  Dogs and cats and pigs and monkeys.  Then 'equity targets' of indegenous peoples from all about the world.  Then we get to the trailor trash the indentured servants who will die of maleria when it's time for us to pay them (all voluntary-like) and then...  Why then we can  be all opportunistic when various high ranking officials get sick.  Someone calls an abulance on them, or something.  A momentary vulnerability.  Get in there and have a go.  Fake it till ya make it.  Take it then you have it.  Nasty brutish and short.  Taken over by over taken by psychopaths.  No other game in town.  Nobody else need apply.</p>

                              <p>I wonder if they hired a brown face to market the marketing of the important targeted research?</p>

                              <p>I wonder how many people actually voted in the 'Voice' election.  Various aboriginal people were saying it was politicised and divisive..  The sort of targeting that we do.  Wherever we have our sights on the food chain.  The great hierarchy of being.  With people trying their very very busy best to become gods.  No conception of anything higher than themselves.</p>
