                            <p>Question:  What does it meeeeeeeeeean... For a `hospital to have been taken over by militants'?  Just so we would know it when we saw it.  Just asking.  For a friend.</p>

                            <p>https://newsroom.co.nz/news/  Huh.  Newsroom looks less like Nature, now.  The branding, I mean.  </p>  

                            <p>What could it possibly meeeeeeeeean for a hospital to have been taken over by miltants?  Maybe when they aren't processing the applications to enrol in medicine, or nursing etc anymore.  They aren't acknowledging progressions through training.  THey aren't honoring graduations.  They aren't publically advertising.  They won't fill the positions.  What could it possibly meeeeeeeean for a hospital to have been taken over by militants????</p>

                              <a href="./writing/ks.png">Here is an example of an email from Kim Sterelny (who will not write me a reference) so you can see how he chooses to speak to me.</a> 

                              I collated the 'few small chunks' as he refers to them, here:
                              </p> 

                                <p><a href="./publish/2013-rep.pdf">Roe, (2013).  A few small chunks for 2013.</a>
                                </p>

                                <p>2018 I wrote a 120 point MPhil for Waikato (because Auckland told me that they'd consider me for MBChB if I completed a new qualification from a NZ University).  I know it was a 120 point 1 EFT qualification --  because that's what I applied to be enrolled in only.  That was what I authorised to be charged to student loan only.  But the University ('university') of Waikato doesn't see it that way.  Quigley thinks he has unlimited power to charge whatever he likes to people's IRD.  He can record them being enrolled in programmes of study they never applied to!  Justice Toogood (over 65, pulled out from retirement for the occasion) doesn't see anything wrong with the 'university' of Waikato keeping false enrolment records.  </p>

                                <p>They refused to send 14 September 2018 thesis out to externals.  Refused to do it.  THey send a 05 October 2018 thesis out with instructions for externals to write `doctoral reports' of the under 50,000 words 120 point thesis only.  Of course they had to say that in order for it to be acceptable more words would need to be added (substantive changes).  But they sent it out to be externally examined for the wrong qualification!  I substantively updated it (and provided a commentary as to how I couldn't do everything the NZ examiner asked of me within the under 50,000 word length limit for the MPhil.  They refused to get the 24 February 2019 substantively updated thesis back to externals.  Never sent it out.  Never sent the commentary out.  30 June 2019 they send it out this time requesting MPhil examination only.  The external examiner doesn't know what year it is.  They wrote external examiners reports in 2019 signing the date as 2012.  FFS.  They request oral defence here:</p>

                                <p> <a href="./writing/OSex2019.pdf">Overseas Examiner's report of 2019 (he seems to think it's 2012)</a>  He asked for an oral defence.  So when is the oral defence?  Waikato updated my transcript to record F that I failed a qualification that I never even applied to be enrolled in.  Now Jacinda apparently gets 3 fellowships from Harvard (I don't know who would have written her a reference for a thing like that when I can't get references from Martin Davies or Kim Sterelny) because she's going to write a  book.  Really.  Really?  Or are they just going to take a book from someone else and cross out their name and write her name on it?  All honorary-like?  What University?  There's nothing there.  </p>

                                <p>We don't have doctors in the hospitals becuase they aren't processing the applications to enrol.  They won't do it.  They aren't processing the graduations.  Dr Leeks and Professor Glue etc etc, Dr Green.  They were the only ones they'd acknowledge.  Nobody else need apply.  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>I applied to do a PhD with the ANU last year -- to see how they would handle my application to enrol.  They aren't processing applications to enrol.  They say my application is 'declined' because it is 'incomplete' -- but that is false.  It was not an incomplete application.  That's just bullsh*t garbage nonsense drivel talk.  My application was good enough for them to enrol me in their doctoral programme before and keep me for how many years?  How many years did I produce work output for the ANU?  Where is my degree?  When did my work go out for external examination?  Do you need me to hard  bind it?  When is my deadline to do that?  Send it out, already?  For how many years am I expected to work while Sterelny gets paid -- how much again?  To do what, now?  He has no teaching.  He has only a small handful of graduate research students.  ANd he's off on holiday.  He's off on conference.  See ya!  Where are his comments and instructions etc?  Check his email outbox.  Why do they pay him?  There's nothing there.   Nobody home.  Not processing applications to enrol.  Not processing graduations.  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>What's that Jacinda?  Our common humanity?  Is that what made you tell the graduates of Harvard (so to speak) that nobody would be prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus in NZ.  It's the real destination location to breed all those knock out sex puppets for their bolt holes.  No doubt.  The new Epstein needs a new wing-man.  How many teenagers will want to go to Harvard to party party party with Jacinda?  That's what academics is.  Of course.  F*cking nailed it.</p>

                                <p>I guess Kim kept giving me other people's work where they had read my work and taken everything they wanted from it and didn't acknowledge or credit me at all.  He delighted in sending me other people's work so I could go 'gee that sounds like my earlier work that nobody credits or acnkowledges me as the author of'.  John Matthewson used to say 'doesn't matter who does the work only matters who is acknowledged or credited as having done the work'.  I guess he would know.  No oral defences because then people would demonstrate that they don't seem to understand very well the work they have been credited with.</p>

                                <p>I applied to work on informed consent.  How there wasn't any medicine in australasia becuase they aren't respecting the consents.  When people are screaming and begging you to stop and not do that and to let them go then that's not medical treatment.  Some things really shouldn't need explaining.</p>

                                <p>My work is obviously not dated.  The new phrenology is the new orthopedics.  The `normal' curves of the spine and exercise prescription.  Fixing the spine into the `normal' position as a treatment.  How hard it is to lie flat.  What that means.  You can lie flat when you are dead is their attitude.  There isn't any healthcare becuase nobody wants anybody else to live.  It's sooooo hostile and competitive.  Right Sterelny?  </p>

                                <p>Development, too.  Tummy time.  Prescribing lying them on their bellies when they don't have strength in their spines to pull their legs out long.  Forcing them to hold their heads up so they don't suffocate when tehy don't have strength to lift their heads up lying on their  backs.  We sooooo loooooove them.  Yeah, right.</p>

                                <p>Know who else just looooooved people?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Harlow  Only one they would fund.  Only one of any actual merits.  Obviously.  Send him forth to help 'other'.  Or maybe people actually are psychopathic enough to appoint him guardian of their own kids.  I don't know.  That's not a game I want to play.  Nobody can function.  Taken over by militants.
