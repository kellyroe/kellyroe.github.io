                            <p>There is an age of retirement for civil servants / government employees.  Many of them were expedited into their payrolled positions on the basis of who their parents were, more than anything else, and they've had 45+ years of government payroll so they could keep entire harems of dependents.  And now it's time for them to retire.  Only, they won't get out.  How old is Justice Toogood?  Since when did reappointing a Judge who was past the age of retirement constitute a Judge having been appointment by proper process?  We are really expected to believe that abosolutely nobody else could have worked that job.  We'll need to blackbird for some foreigner to work it.  Lure them here under false pretences.  Get them to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for visa processing and moving expenses.  Then simply not pay them and awwwww.  What are they going to do about it?  Them and whose army?  How many 'medical doctors' are over the age of 65.  Still on government payroll.  They won't train anybody else, they won't register anybody else.  Mostly they don't actually know anything.  They were hurried into postition when they were 17 or 18.  Quickly quickly quickly before the people realise they don't know anything and they simply aren't that bright.  Get in there!  Have a go!  Abortions.  Euthanasia.  Arficial insemination.  Knock-out babies.  Gene studies.  Fixing up the nasal polyps (labotomies).  Electric stimulation to the genitals.  The babies in the incubators.  Experiments on oxygen deprivation and setting them up for a lifetime of 'I'm soooo lucky I'm a gamma baby I don't have to work half as hard as Ashley Bloomfield'...  The only game in town.  Can't even / won't even process applications for enrolment.  Won't acknowledge progression through training.  Can't even / won't even get work to external examiners.  What University?  What Health System?  What Judiciary?  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  There's really nothing there, hey.  All these people over 65 years on payroll and however many of the next generation expected to just f*ck off and die, then, so that the likes of Justice Toogood can have yet another day in court.  He can't even / won't even see anything wrong...  Poor Dr Leeks.  Poor Dr Green.  What they were doing wasn't any different or any worse than anything that everybody else on payroll was or is doing.  Right?  Poor poor them.  Best give them more and more government handouts to enable them to move someplace new and continue on with their crimes.  </p>
