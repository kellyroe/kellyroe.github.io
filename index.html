                                <p>This website documents how Australasia does not have functioning health system, education system, or judiciary.  Nobody was held to account for atrocities around the time of WWII and they never stopped with them.  Australasia cannot claim to be 'rule by law' or part of the free and developed world.  The leaders choose to run the nation/s as a detention camp only. 
                                </p>

                                <p>There are no universities.  They won't get the students work out to external examiners.  They keep hostages collecting up more and more and more money from the government and from the student to keep them enrolled and re-enrolled and re-enrolled.  They employ slavers, effectively.  I don't know if people have been passing my academic work off as their own (or re-attributing it to other people) but they seem to have a 'yay' or 'boo' theory of academic achievement which is mostly tied to who your Daddy is.  Then the idea is that the people on payroll can take the work and ouputs from others and take more and more and more money for themslves by forcing re-enrolment and re-enrolment and re-enrolment. There is no education and training system, here.  No judiciary.  No health system.  Nothing nothing nothing at all.
