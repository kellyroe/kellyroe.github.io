 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2023/01/alleged-fraudulent-auckland-university-graduate-practised-psychiatry-in-uk-for-19-years-court-hears.html</p>

                                <p>Likely they wouldn't have hired her at all if they didn't think that she was a fraud.  I would imagine that when you are keeping institutions that are not even pretending to be theraputic so that you can torture people, effectively, and keep them punatively in conditions the UN would likely say amount to torture, then you have a certain special kind of staffing problem.  Wouldn't you say?  How are you going to find people willing to commit atrocities?  Or, at the very very least, willing to turn a blind eye to atrocities being committed by others?  I would imagine that you would have to find people willing to do anything anything anything anything.  Really train them up.  Teach them all about 'the other' and how badly you will treat them if they don't comply.
                                </p>

                                <p>Why are they going after her now?  All of a sudden?  What happened for them to declare her to be a fraud now, all of a sudden?  Time for them to pay her, was it?</p>

                                <p>The Calendar Regulations say they can hold you back for 1  year (make you repeat 1 year) of Medical School.  It does not make sense, therefore, that she would have dropped Medicine entirely after being failed for 1 year of the course when repeating the year (so the University can get more fees from you) is something that they do.  In fact, Didn't 1/3rd (at least) of the Medical Cohort of University of Otago fail their internship which meant their Degree was withheld?  They had recieved signoff from their internship placement but the University didn't accept that it was sending them to placements that the University would acknowledge (accused them not of paying bribes for sign off but of not doing enough work even though they had been signed off).  They wanted them to take up their junior doctor positions in the NZ hosptials, anyway, but they weren't going to pay them their junior doctor salary.  THey were going to need to keep paying the university.</p>

                                <p>There aren't that many psychiatrists in the world.  If she was accepted to train as a psychiatrist in the UK and she practiced in fact it is disingenuous to think or say that nobody knew of her or remembered her as having failed out if she did fail out in fact.</p>

                                <p>They intentionally select criminals so that they don't pay them.  Then they move them around so that again, they don't pay them.  Also, the whole doing anything anything anything anything anything.  Keeping people in punative conditions of torture and so on and so forth.  Nobody there.  Nothing home.</p>
