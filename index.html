                                That's considerably more than 50,000  words of research output in one year?  This is years after I give him a more than 100,000 words thesis document that he never gave me supervisory comments on and he never gave to externals to examine.  I'll just keep giving him more than 50,000 words of reseach every year and he can...  Reattribute authorship to others?  Is that the idea? I suppose the point of him emailing me this was that I was supposed to cry cry cry and plead about how I'd do anything anything anything not to be cut from the programme.  He was fishing for me to send him more work.  So he could redistribute it to others so they could claim the research output.
</p>

<p>E.g., John Matthewson took credit for publishing work on function (the new work that Kim is thinking of, no doubt.  Attrtibuted to John Matthewson).  John took all my handouts and seminars from various conferences and workshops, you see.  John would say 'it's not about who does the work it's about who is credited as having done the work'.    Fiona MacPhearson took my seminar handouts and was very interested in what she told me was a new topic for her (delusion).  She asked me to send her stuff for co-authorship.  She then started giving seminar talks about publication that she had written without crediting or acknowledging me, at all.  I don't know how much more of that there is because I don't read their work outputs.  They don't pay me to read their outputs.  Their outputs are mostly kept behind paywall which makes sense of why they don't want me having University affiliation anymore.  Kim would say that anything more than 5 years old is considered abandonware.  So they only need delay publication for 5 years before they feel entitled to reattribute authorship.</p>


<p>I did not see any of the students (not Rachel Brown, not Nick Southwood) with reports from external examiners.  I did not see either of them (or anybody else) defend their thesis publically after receiving external examiners reports.  I did not see anybody graduate.  Did anybody?  How did they decide who to publically credit with PhD?  Did they credit anybody?  Various people found their way onto payroll, allegedly or apparently.  Apparently various people are on payroll.  But I'm just expected to keep handing over my work for no pay.  What Universities?  </p>

<p>Tahua O'Leary...  I was told that the external examiners accepted the thesis they were sent from him without requesting any changes or alterations to the thesis.  The University would not get his work out for external examination until he had been working on it for how many..  Decades?  And then the external examiners did not find so much as a typographical error?  Not so much as a single misplaced apostrophe?  They couldn't find even 1 reference they thought should be added?  I mean to say it's more likely that they never sent it out for external examination at all than that externals had nothing at all to say.  It's not very psychologically plausible to think that an external examiner wouldn't find something to pick.  To justify their extistence as external.  What happened to or with an oral defence?  When was that scheduled?  The public defence?  What Universities?</p>

<p>I did not see Holly Lawford-Smith with reports from external examiners, with a scheduled public oral defence.  Did she graduate?  How?  I did not see John Matthewson with reports from external examiners or with a scheduled public oral defence.  Did he graduate?  I did not see Ben Jeffares or Brett Calcott...  I did not see Aiden whatever his last name is.  Adrian.  Any of them.  I didn't see any of the ANU graduate research students with reports of external examiners, I did not see any of them have a scheduled oral defence.  Did any of them actually graduate?  Apparently various of them were given paid employment in Philosophy post-graduation.  Given paid positions that were supposed to have conferred PhD as a pre-requisite.  They were given the paid positions.  But did they graduate, at all?  I mean anybody can pay a couple hundred dollars for a hard-bound book.  I wonder if they have transcripts and what their transcripts say.  I wonder if they have pieces of paper proclaiming them to be doctor for their wall.  I wonder how the visas go...  It just does not make any sense to me, at all.  Do they just apply for positions and for funding and say that they have a PhD?  Does Kim Sterelny actually write them references acknowledging they have done enough work for a PhD?  Or do they just write their own references?  Kim Sterelny won't write me a reference.  Martin Davies wouldn't write me a reference after I wrote the work on delusions based on the summer school scholarship.  THey don't have basic honesty and integrity.  Not so far as I can see.  There's nothing there, at all. </p>

<p>I found the following little bits.  You can really follow my CV on the 'descent into madness' or similar, that there is.  Not really a 'descent into madness' but taking...  What was that?  One of the best students they've ever seen and bullying them into outputting work that was garble.  Gaslighting to garbage.  No speak English.  Up is down and in is out and it's down and out and round and round.  The wicked problem of evil and all those terms are technical.  The esteemed literature of the various kept on payroll.  That's the idea.  Right?  How many years of ignoring research output.  What University?  They say everybody has one book in them.  I suppose by that they mean that you kill someone (fail them out or bully them away) and you take their work as a trophy and pass it off as your own.  Right?  Just the one.  Enough for tenure.  Like how Dr Leeks was most revered for being a pedophile. Know who else is most valued?  Plagarisers.  People who will take their students work and pass it off as their own and fail their studnets else bully them into fleeing.  What University?  </p>

<p>You just go 'no no no no no' re-write it different.  You just keep saying that.  Pick out every second sentance and go 'no, where is the evidence for that'? And so on.  Kim Sterelny thinks that Philosophy is bio-technology where anything more than 5 years old is obsolete.  Of course.  Plato and Aristotle are so last year.  That's why he takes the philosophy out of philosophy so he can claim that.  Claim to be too f*ckign stupid to see patterns of yesteryear.  Of course it's only my work that dates.  Becomes dated.  When it's time for him to get it to externals if he's too f*cking psychopathic to do his f*cking job.  Apparently (the fake news says) the ANU has another NZ student, now, working on the prison detention hostage refugee camps of Australia.  They think it's funny to keep a NZ pet hostage workign on that within the fine institution of the ANU.  Quite the trophy for them or similar.</p>

<p>Kim Sterelny had only a small handful of graduate research studnets.  He had no teaching.  He only had to supervise our work to completion.  ANd he takes and he takes and he takes and he takes and he takes.  And he won't (else can't) talk about any of his work that was done more than about 5 years ago.  Likely becuase..  He doesn't understand it.  He probably wasn't the author of it, at all.  I wonder if Frank Jackson was.  Or how or why he's saying that he's co-authoring various things with Kim Sterelny.  It just doesn't make any sense at all.</p>

<p>What University?  For all the EFTS of enrolment..  Australasia..  For all the studnets you claim to have enrolled in graduate research qualifications -- where is the research output?  Where the hell is it?  All the 50,000 word masters theses?  The 50,000 words of research output every f*cking year.  For how many years is someone supposed to demonstrate their capacity before they get publically acknowledged and payroll for f*cks sake.  Kim is over 65 and it's time to go.  Get the f*ck out.  You f*cking psychopath.  Get the f*ck out.</p>

        <p>The law and medicine assignments (above) make it clear they are vocational training and not academic oriented.  The law essay instructions (I can't find them now) did not say that we were to provide references from case law or otherwise.  Clearly.  Usually I do provide references for academic work and I wouldn't have ommitted to provide references if I was instructed to have supplied references.  I wouldn't have made such a silly error as to have ommitted reference to particular cases -- if I had have been instructed to have supplied references to cases, in particular.  I wouldn't have not done that unless they specifically told me that it was okay before I wrote my essay.  I didn't fall on my head anytime between my previous work and this work ffs.  How many times am I supposed to prove my capacity over and over and over and over and over.  An entire lifetime of research output for low to no pay.  While various other people kept on hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.  They refuse to meet with me because they know full well I understand the work they have been credited as the author of.  THey aren't willing and or able to engage in academic dialogue or discourse or debate.  They don't seem to understand their own reserach outputs much of the time.  No oral defence for them either, it seems.  The Medical people wouldn't allow ANY of us to reference properly - no direct quotation.  Even when quite a few people in the class were graduates of arts / social sciences degrees.  Only enrolled in the class because they advised us it was required for 'competitive entry to MBChB'.  I think the idea is for them to get studnets uploading to Turnitin academic work that would not be acceptable if students from Princeton or Rutgers or wherever submitted it as their own.  It's not academic work.  It doesn't reference an academic literature (it references NZ government websites only).  It doesn't have references.  Then you write the students up as not being able to produce academic output.  That's the idea isn't it Sterelny?  How garbelled you need to keep everybody else so that you appear competent by contrast.  Only accept into 2nd year Medicine people you feel okay about refusing to graduate later.  They can pay and pay and pay the 'university' for re re re re re enrolment.  You don't need to worry about them being seen as attractive to overseas nations.  Not unless they want to participate in teh keeping of slaves.   
        </p>

        <p>It's so obviously a 'I'm a gamma baby' degree.  Else...  I was picked out (all Stanford Prison Experiment, like) to be over-lord.  They have learned how you pick out a few all arbitrarily to manage the masses (in the name of trickle down economics) and, of course, with that set-up it won't take very long at all before the elite few start bashing and beating and blaming the majority for being..  Losers.  Isn't that right, Sterelny?</p>

        <p>The NZ Philosophy people started telling me that there would be a job for me only over their dead bodies when I was in my Honors year.  When they started hearing me give seminars at conferences etc.  That's what they said to me.  There would be a job for me only over their dead bodies.  Now, many of them are over 65 - and they won't get out.  So seems that that is right.  They actually need to die, or something, before there can be a job for me.  Is that actually right?</p>

        <p>I said I wanted to do Medicine.  I was no threat to them.  I wasn't after their job.  I wasn't after funding for or from philosophy.  I could go study Medicine and see about getting funding from there..  But even that wasn't good enough for them.  It wasn't about withholding employment in Philosophy, specifically, it seems. It was more about generally.  Just generally.  They liked where I was positioned (under them) on the social hierarchy, or something.  And I'd only get out from under their thumb when they were dead.  I suppose it was more that that was the idea.  And as for Medicine?  There doesn't seem to be anything there at all.  It's just a scam to get people to pay and pay and pay for re re re re re enrolment.  They put them to work in the name of internship and when it's time for them to stop paying the 'University' then it's time for them to die or be deported or whatever.  Go away.  So they can be replaced by new students who will pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the 'University'.  There's nothing there.  What education and training system?  There's nothing there,  hey.</p>

        <p>Why don't I have a payroll?  Where is my money for all of the f*cking work that I've f*ckign well done?  All these other people on payroll.  Hundreds of thousands of dollars per year for Chris Whelan to refuse to acknowledge ANY complaints.  He had 1 job to do.  All of this money for Kim Sterelny to supervise graduate research student theses to timely completion.  He had 1 f*cking job to do.  What the f*ck.  Hurry up and die you f*cking arseholes.  F*cking hurry up.  </p>
