                            <p>If you reroll your 'data' 100 times you will probably find what you are looking for at least once.  It's important to focus on that.  For everything it is that you value.  Telling the story and all that.  Where are the voting papers?  I don't suppose it matters since they wouldn't count them.  But even if they did it wouldn't make a difference.  What hint of 'try' do you see?</p>

                            <p>The University of Auckland advertises for people to be paid (I think they are paid positions, but I'm not actually sure, maybe they wanted expressions of interest to volunteer) to cry cry cry to retired people. Cry cry cry to alumni.  For donations.  Handouts.  For the Medical and Law departments, aparently.  They have all these people over the age of 65 who are still on payroll in the Medical and Law departments etc.  They keep them still on payroll even though they are past the age of retirement.  So that they can pay (or have a volunteer) to cry cry cry cry to them to get the over 65's to voluntarily choose to give up part of their salary from the Law or Medical School, one can only suppose, so that the money can.  Um.  Go back to them themselves for their payroll?  That's how the money goes around?  Or maybe it's their brains they are after.  Professor Faull's brain bank.  So that they don't have to cull the female rugby players early, or something, to see what happens to the brain when they undergo force without helmets, and so on.  They can give them the brains of the elders instead.  For the good of..  Well, it's not in the public's interest, says the Supreme Court.  Of course.  They'd have things no other way.  I'm sure that Dawn Freshwater (from the UK) was the only applicant they had with a good knowledge of the Statutory Law of NZ regarding what her function was as VC of a Research Focussed Institution.  I'm sure there was no other applicant they acknowledged as having been received for the position they gave to her.  She was acknowledged as having completed training as a mental health nurse.  I suppose they acknowledge that only on the condition that she never be paid to (or even volunteer her time to) work as a clinical health nurse.  Never teach anybody else to do that.  Never engage in any research.  She can be Vice Chancellor in a foreign land for everything it is that we value.  Nobody else need have applied.  Imposter syndrome, anyone?</p>

                            <p>https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/health/babies-died-of-congenital-syphilis-after-missed-opportunities-esr-report/  'prenatal' is before birth and 'antenatal' is after.  Actually no.  'Ante' is more appropriately 'Anti', one can only suppose...  I suppose it would be more convenient to blame pregnant women for having untreated syphilis than to blame the medical team for giving the newborns syphilis in order to observe the presence of disease in the absense of treatment for it.  Where else in the world could you go to observe syphilis in newborn Maaori infants?  I think they cracked down on the observational studies of untreated syphilis in the adult nego male back in the..  Um..  The whens?  Rickets in the maaori kids of northland.  Etc.  Where else but NZL?  Rheumatic fever.  From withholding antibiotics.  So that John Fraser can make a vaccine (yeah, right).  How many years did vaccine development take, again?  What's his excuse, therefore?  Perhaps he never would have been deployed into position any other way...  I'm sure.  They used to talk about giving the natives small-pox infected blankets.  So motivational and inspirational for everything it is that we value, wouldn't you say?  Let's understand why it is that they refuse to wash their hands.  It isn't ignorance.  It is evil.  Why they will not follow infectious disease prevention protocols etc.  It isn't ignorance.  It is evil.  Will have things no other way.  </p>

                            <p> https://www.thepress.co.nz/a/nz-news/350071652/australia-luring-nz-doctors-offers-double-pay?utm_id=stuff_skybox  This is a joke.  It is designed to have the Medical Students do anything anything anything everything everything they are told when they are told because they are told...  While they are Medical Students.  With the promise of how they will have a better life once they are graduated.  Once they are graduated they can move to Australia and earn upwards of half a million per year.  If only they consent to being raped by their superiors..  If only they irradiate the patients to an untimely demise now just think of all the patients they can choose not to prematurely kill later...  That's why they won't graduate them.  They won't acknowledge the qualification completions.  Because then they'd have to pay them.  But why would they pay them when they can get the Medical Students to pay them!  Why pay your doctors when you can get the student doctors to pay you!  What health system? It's been taken over by psychotics.  Psychopaths.  It's a joke is what it is.  How many applicants did they get for the job?  How many were thrown away?  Who got the job?  Who was deployed into position to kill as many people with radiation (one by one by one)..  What do you think a Medcial Oncologist does?  Targets cells for the production of cancer.  Killing the person in the name of cancerous cells.  Would have things no other way.  Quickly quickly quickly get them when they are 18.  Tell them to push this and that button on the system and they follow instructions.  Wasn't them..  Was the singularity!  Never was there better reason to believe!!! </p>

                            <p>'Medical Schools' don't cost the government money.  They make the government money.  Here is how the scam does not work.  (1)  Advertise that wah wah wah we don't have any doctors.  Maybe make up a propaganda campaign like 'Shortland Street'.  Something sexy.  Get everybody wanting to play doctors and nurses.  (2)  Take the visa processing fees.  People from all around the world can see how much it would cost to buy their children a Medical Degree from the US (that's a 4 year college degree followed by a 4 year medical degree).  They can see how much it would cost to buy their children a 'Medical Degree' from NZL...  They can choose to pay and pay and pay and pay the NZL government for visa processing.  Pay and pay and pay and pay for health exams and so on to go with the visa processing.  Pay and pay and pay the 'Universities' for their 'education and training'.  (3)  We can tell them to 'get in there' and 'have a go' and 'fake it till ya make it' on the 'internships' they have been deployed into.  (4)  We can say that they haven't been signed off as having completed their internship.  Either nobody was supervising them / was able to supervise them / was able to assess them else they fail for whatever reason.  It doesn't matter.  The entire point is that they pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and pay and they never stop paying.. To play doctors and nurses.  Now, the government stands to win win win win win.  They can fund a 'University' and they can fund a 'Hospital'.  They don't need to pay any employees...  Not to do clinical work, that's for sure.  They can get the students playing at doing it.  </p>

                            <p>What else is there?  It's not like it's any different from what Auckland and Otago are doing.  Is it any different from what Harvard is doing?  I honestly don't know.  Likely it is not.  I saw that Brown (as one example) said that, due to Covid, people could either (1) Take their graduation early (be graduated without having completed their internships since internships stopped 'due to Covid' and start their match positions working rather than training else...  (2) Indefinately delay or post-pone graduation until such time as internships resumed.  Or actually were started for the very first time.  Or something comparable to that.  So...  There's likely nothing there, more generally.  Else that's what they were marketing around that time.  I don't know if that was Brown, specifically.  That was the plan for Otago, anyway.  Obviously.  That fairly clearly is the plan for University of Western Australia.  Take the children when they are 18 and put them to 'work' (unpaid) just following orders or instructions.  Or just doing whatever they want, really.  Then you can see which of them are the next Dr Leeks and ensure that they are the only ones acknowledged and employed.  For everything it is that we value.  The only thing of any value.  Exterminating the 'Other' or some such.  </p>

                            <p>The entire health system likely doesn't cost the government anything at all.  The great myth.  It would be their biggest earner.  How much some people will pay in order to commit whatever atrocities they want to in our 'hospitals' etc.  How much money did Dr Leeks make for the NZ government pimping the kids out?  How much money does Professor Glue etc make now?  It's an earner -- correct?  Part of international hospitality?  For people flying into the country on business?  Can't do business in NZL...  Trade centre burned to the ground twice.  Not safe to travel here.  Can't do business in this jurisdication when the judiciary will not uphold the law...</p>

                            <p>Here is the great plan for preventing and prohibiting medicine from being available to people in rural communities.  What we can do is deploy the 'medical students' into rural placements where they can pass themselves off as doctors and nurses and healthcare assistants.  They can say 'awwwww feel better' and do cervical and prostate exams.  They can get in there and do anything anything anything.  Unsupervised.  Just so long as they pay and pay and pay the 'university' they can play doctors and nurses for as long as they like.  When they are done paying the 'university' and done paying the government for visa processing and medical checks for themselves.  TB scans etc.  When they are done paying for their 'training' it is time for them to go away.  To be replaced by new 'students' who will pay and pay and pay and pay and pay.  It's really not that hard to understand the scummy scam of how health is a money-earner for the government.  It's soooo competitive!  People all falling over each other to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay!!!</p>

                            <p>What is 'frictional unemployment' these days, in New Zealand?  For how many months can a person expect or anticipate to be applying for employment, before something suitable comes through?  I'm wondering out loud,  because I am applying...  I have  been applying.  I have been sending through (1)  applications.  I have also been sending through (2)...  I will call (2) 'statements of concerns' or reservations that I have about working within certain or particular organisations.  For example, the 'University' of Auckland.  For example, the new health department organisation thing.  I have also (3) not applied to certain things because of concerns about what may be involved.  For example, I have held off applying for employment to do with visa processing because of what has been in the news about how employees are feeling forced to work under pressure to approve visas where people are set up for exploitation.  Now, I would have problems or issues with doing this.  Many people have problems or issues with doing this.  Many other people will do it anyway, though, and not speak up or out about it.  I don't know.  Maybe they have small children at home and they can tell themselves they are worried the government will target their small children for exclusion and abuses if they don't keep their heads down...  I don't know...  What lengths will they go to force compliance or strongly induce compliance.  Whether real or just propagating the idea that these things might or could happen.  Fearmongering etc.  So...  I can follow the proper process on raising issues with superiors.  Then they delay for the maximum time and it goes to their superiors.  So it takes however many years to work it's way up the food-chain and to international community.  Delay delay delay until they've been pronounced dead by the only people they'd pay to pronounce death.  Is that the idea?  For the good of...  Uh, for the good of, uh, for the good of who, again?</p>

                            <p>My full-time GPA for undergraduate and honors years was 8.6.  That is part way between an A and an A+.  That was the prounouncement on the quality of my academic work.  I then wrote a first masters thesis, a doctoral thesis, a second masters thesis.  Now, people confuse not liking what I have to say with the fact that I've done it or said it or whatever.  The 'Universities' think that by employing or payrolling people who say 'I'm off on holiday now, see ya!' instead of supervising that they never need graduate their students.  But the students have been put to work in the name of their training programme.  And instead of their payroll they were supposed to be given a qualification after the bums were on the seats for whatever length of time.  I handed work over...  Nobody called me in for a meeting to say that they had any concerns about my progress.  Nobody said I hadn't done enough work for the qualifiations.  People joke about how I'd done the work for the qualifications before I'd even been enrolled in the programme!  I'd done a doctoral thesis of work for my first masters credit!  They won't pay the workers.  They won't credit the people who have done the work!  But I can show people that the work was done.  So they simply pronounce and proclaim to the world that they are lacking in honesty and integrity and they are not even trying to be fair, at all.  Where is my money?  Hey...  Where is the money?  Where did you put it?  Where did it go?  Where is my job title!  THat's what I get now.  Right?  So that I can be paid and paid and paid to tell the next generation 'now is your turn to slave and slave and slave doing all the work in the name of your training programme while I say 'I'm off on holiday now!  See ya!''.</p>

                            <p>The 'imposter syndrome' thing is real.  It goes like this.  (1)  They throw away any applications they get from the target population.  Let's say African-American, as an example.  (2)  They find a couple weak applications and put those through 'in the name of equity'.  (3)  Now you have 'equity candidates' (at Harvard, or similar) who can say 'The only reason why I'm at Harvard is because of their affirmative action programme'.  They can rightly say they wouldn't be there if it wasn't because of it.  THe only reason they were picked out to be there was because of it.  They also say that they feel that they are imposters.  That they don't belong there.  That they shouldn't be there.  That they would never have been picked to do it if their application had been processed blind to what race they were.  But the real point or purpose or whatever of the equity policy was to prevent and prohibit those with capacity or capability those with most merit from doing the programme.  SO that they could expedite selection for people who would..  Make it more likely for people to feel racist thoughts against people of the race.  Now, I'm not saying anything that hasn't been said before.  It's been said before that some people in the US will say they don't want to see a black doctor because they believe that the black doctors were all picked for training and graduation precisely because they were not as competent as the white doctors.  They never would have picked the black ones if they weren't weaker candidates.  That's the way the racism goes.</p>

                            <p>So we end up with these people in positions who feel (rightly) that they were only appointed for being incompetent.  I guess they are more likely to keep their heads down.  Is the value.  They only get picked to do the job because they...  I don't know...  Can't teach people what they don't know, or something.  So we don't have to worry about them teaching the next generation.  They will keep it oppressed.  Prevention and prohibition of flourishing and thriving and so on.  For the good of..  Uh..  The good of..  For the good of, whom, again?</p>

                            <p>The 'calibre' of some applicants.  Sure.  The 'calibre' of people who (1) Won't raise issues with superior officers who (2)  Won't go over their heads if things are not dealt with appropriately who (3)  won't start up their own website to publish their version of events.  Are they even trying to be fair, at all?  </p>

                            <p>The 'calibre' of the people they hire for the Human Rights Tribunals.  For the Ombudsman.  People go over their heads -- they take issues overseas.  To the UN etc.  Because of the calibre of the people they choose to hire for the Human Rights Tribunal and the Office of the Ombudsman etc etc in NZ.  People go over their heads.  People with disability etc.  Go over the heads of the only people the government will hire into position to not see anything wrong.  It's like they've had their eyes poked out.  Won't have things any other way.  Have I 'done enough' to be employed to process applications.  I know how the application processing goes.  If they are competent we throw the application away.  If they are not competent we deploy them into position so they can say 'the only reason why I was hired for this job is  because I'm not competent to do it'.  'I'm off on holiday now!  See ya!  Let's have no research output this year!  They wouldn't have employed me any other way!'</p>

                            <p>Apparently qualifications are just supposed to be about doing 'enough' for a paycheque.  Well, then, where is my pay cheque?  Either I've done enough or I've done too much.  I'm either too tall or too short.  I'm too thick I'm too thin I'm too smart I'm not smart enough.  I'm sick and f*cking tired of the bullsh*t made up excuses where you hire imposters into position for all the qualities that you value, one can only suppose.  The prevention and prohibition of development programme.  The 'we can't see anything wrong we won't see anything wrong there is nothing wrong we insist on continuing on with all the atrocities we can get away with what are you going to do about it you and whose army'? manner or mode or style of governance.  There's nothing there...  PROCESS THE APPLICATION.  HURRY UP.  It's not rocket science ffs...  Not brain science.  It's really not that f*cking hard.</p>

                            <p>The statutory laws of NZ state what the statutory function of the NZVCC is supposed to be.  Chris Whelan (in his position as CE) is supposed to exemplify that function.  The statutory law is clear about the function being to uphold complaints of wrong-doing in accordance with international requirements on protecting whistleblowers.  To this end Chris Whelan has led an organisation (since about 2014 when he was appointed to office) that acknowledge receipt of NO COMPLAINTS OF WRONG-DOING.  He tells the judge (pulled out of retirement to not see anything wrong - the embodiment of injustice) that they get more complaints every year..  More and more and more.  But NONE of them are classified by his office as complaints of 'wrong-doing'.  They have written policy documents on what constitutes 'wrong-doing' but they refuse to acknowledge that any of the complaints they have received count as complaints of 'wrong-doing'.  Even when the complaints are wrong-doing according to their policy.  Apparently Ms Roe is the only person who has ever successfully lodged, with the NZVCC, a complaint of serious wrong-doing against one of the 'universities' of NZL.  The High Court Judge (not appointed by proper process) declared it to be so!  The High Court Judge said that instead of following the statutory law on processing the complaint (getting the evidence of wrong-doing to the police so they can prosecute the 'university') Chris Whelan should change his policy so that no complaint of wrong-doing can be acknowledged as having been received.  For the good of whom, again?  Says the +++65 year old injustice pulled from retirement for precisely the occasion...   </p>

                            <p>The Supreme Court acknowledges this is not in the public's interest.</p>

                            <p>What 'universities'?  What 'judiciary'?</p>

                            <p>Vice Chancellor of the New Zealand Vice Chancellor's Committee.  I could do the job better than Chris Whelan.  He has led an organisation where they have refused to acknowledge that they have received any complaints of wrong-doing when the organisation had one job to do.  That job pays a couple hundred thousand dollars per year.  I would have done it with pay restraint, even.  You can see it's not about the money, hey.  Not about the money, at all.  Recently the 'University' of Waikato advertised for a Vice Chancellor of Research.  Who do you think would do a better job of leading an organisation with demonstrated research output?  Quigley, or me?  I self-published my own research.  Quigley wouldn't acknowledge my research output.  There is more research output with me.  He had one job to do.  The Statutory law says Universities primary function is research.  What does Quigley do to support his academics research output?  The prevention and prohibition of research output.  The keeping of slaves.  The supression of complaints.  How much did Quigley get paid?  Were there really no other applicants for their paid employment positions?  They were the only game in town, we are supposed to believe?  All the other applications were thrown away by the only people you'd acknowledge on your HR?  Seriously?  No other game in town!  For the good of..  For the good of..  For the good of whom again?</p>

                            <p>What University?  What Judiciary?  What developed nation?  What a f*cking joke!</p>

                            <p>Yes.  I applied to be Vice Chancellor of Research with the University of Waikato.  But why would they process an application for employment when they can't even / they won't even process an application for anything else?  They can't even / won't even process an application for enrolment.  They won't do it.  They will hire from overseas rather than hiring one of their own.  There's nothing there.  Quite by design.  One can only suppose.  Not even trying to be fair at all.  They don't want a medical school.  They want more and more and more money for re re re re re re re enrolments.  Who will teach in their medical school?  See ya!  I'm off on holiday now!  Just get in there!  Have a go!  Then get out and we'll replace you with new students.  That's the plan for 'healthcare'?  Which means to say there is no plan.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.   Nothing nothing nothing at all.  Quite by design.</p>

                            <p>All the research work done by people in the 'University' that the 'University' refuses to acknowledge as research output.  From the students, also from people on payroll.  They take students who are writing 1,500 word essays x2 per  per class for up to 8 classes, so up to 24,000 words of research output in their first year and they give them high grades for research ouptut all the way up to 10,000 word essays (or 5,000 x 2) for 4 honours level courses so 40,000 words of research in one year...  And their research academics on payroll output how many words of research per year?  Nothing?  Unless they choose to take the research outputs of their students and pass those off as their own?  What research output?  Where is the research output of the 'University'?  The primary function is research.  By statutory law.  Where is the research output of your 'University' Quigley? It's like the people on your payroll all fell on their heads, or something.  Once they got tenure.  See ya!  I'm off on holiday!  By the way -- you fail.  There will be no research output acknowledged as being outputted by this 'university'.</p>

                            <p>Apparently there are academic merit government scholarships for research funding.  The 'Universities' refuse to name the receipients of the research funding awards.  I think that the most likely explanation for this is that the money is not being paid to the receipients.  They try and starve people into dropping out.  It's sooooo competitive!  You should count youself lucky if your supervisor says you should house-sit for them when they say because they say.  Otherwise you wouldn't have any house to live in!  You could go away camping with them on their camping trips!  It's sooooo competitive!   Stay in the University residential halls. Without so much as secure food storage or a private bathroom.  Without a secure lock on your bedroom door.  Payroll the 18 year old boys to have keys to the girls rooms and console them after they've been raped at University?  By the children of the only people you'd acknowledge as judge etc etc.  One can only suppose.  That makes the best sense of the situation really.  Doesn't it?  What university?  What is the  nature of the complaints that Chris Whelan fails to process every year.  Refuses to get evience to police.  Corruption.  Corruption.  Corruption.  Let me guess:  Nobody else need bother applying for Chris Whelan's job.  He was appointed into position after employees complained about the VC of Queensland allowing his daughter to be enrolled in MBChB when she shouldn't have been (stealing a place from someone else).  His daughter wasn't removed.  There was no reparation for the person whose place his daughter stole.  What health system?  Psychopaths.  Nobody else need bother applying.  No places left.  Who will teach them?  It would be irresponsible to teach them anything.  I guess that is the idea.  Is it?  There's nothing there.  Not even trying to be the developed world, at all.  Not even trying to be rule by law.  Nothing there.  Nobody home.</p>


                            <p> https://www.seek.co.nz/job/69999879?type=standout#sol=26437d7ee5d9aa8d6a73355485697945bd28bd43  Now the government wants 'managers' (with no academic background in medicine or research) to run the clinical trials and medical experiments to be conducted on 'target populations' (i.e., the gamma babies) in the naaaaaame of 'equity'!  Everybody knows that that's the job of government.  To run medical experiments on people who have no right to protest, object, or not be volunteered.  The government is sooooo busy doing things it's not supposed to be doing (things beyond it's scope) that it doesn't have any time or money or resources left to do any of the things that they're supposed to do.  I guess it makes sense that Ayesha and Shane and Ashley would be graduated from Medicine.  They have how many  hours of clinical practice  between them?  That was why they were graduated -- right?  Because they never would be paid to work that job.  What univesrity?  But then, what government?  What election?  What developed nation?  There really doesn't seem to be anything there...  Can't even / won't even process applications to enrol.  Hurry hurry hurry give everything to the highest bidders from overseas so you can lure them here under false pretenses.  How much does it cost for a South African born person who trained in England to buy for themselves 'New Zealander of the year'?  She was the marketing con-munications face of Medicine -- wasn't she?  So...  Do her 'students' who work in her 'laboratories' with infectious organisms have PPE, yet?  What education system?   Not even trying to be fair.  There's nothing here.  Not even trying to be fair. </p>

                            <p>The thing with the face masks was opening the cupboards -- and seeing the cupboards were bare.  Why is it they are wanting to feed LSD and ketamine and so on to people taken into hospital detention?  Is it because the actual medicines were stolen and sold on the black market etc?  How do you think the doctors and nurses and pharmacists will make their money if you don't pay them?  How is it supposed to go, do you think?  With this wonderful plan that we have to never see evidence of any corruption.  To never perceive corruption.  To never acknowledge receipt of any complaints.  To swiftly cull the people with any concerns.  To teach people that if they speak up then things will become worse, only.  Only that's not true.  When you speak up and see things become worse  you know it isn't that things are becoming worse.  It's just that the cover on how bad things are is being lifted up.  So that how bad things are is made manifest.  Are we trying to make things better?  Really?  Was it 'try' that led to judges being reappointed from retirement (not by proper process)?  Is that what 'trying to be fair' looks like?  Was it 'try' that resulted in the Supreme Court of NZ proclaiming to the world that they didn't know what 'public interest' was...  Else the word salad that has them pronounce 'what was done was not in the public's interest, at all, therefore it is not in the public interest to ensure that it continue on.  We won't put a stop to the NZ 'universities' refusing to process applications to enrol, refusing to acknowledge progression through training, refusing to get theses to externals, refusing to allow externals to sign off on qualifiation completions.  It is not in the public interest that Chris Whelan refuses to acknowledge receipt of any complaints of wrongdoing (while admitting he has more complaints than he can process).  None of this is in the public's interest.  That Chris Whelan throws the complaints of wrongdoing away.  All this is not in the public's interest.  The High Courts pronounce 'Carry on!  The public must pay for the crimes of the government!  The public must pay!  The public must pay!' .  They got that right - it is not in the public interest, at all.  The health system and education system and so on are not in the public interest.  They are not social services.  They are the prevention and prohibition of social services.  They are the underminig of public interest.  They have set about making as many gamma babies who will shut up about the crimes of the over-lords..  The 'we happy few'.  The pedophiles and rapists and bullies and murderers.  The likes of Dr Leeks.  Trafficked about the world as 'most desirable' for purposes, one can only suppose, of population control.  How is that working out?  </p>

                            <p>How are the  natural disasters working out?  Enough funds being freed up to go to the over-lords for their new-builds?  That's the function of goverment, right?  To declare war against the people.  Weather bomb here, weather bomb there.  Targeted experiment there.  Involuntary detention here...  Don't get sick now, ya hear!  Is the world better or worse for you having been in it...  I don't know.  How many will turn up to your funeral to check for themselves..  Is he really dead?  Really?  Really really really?  Party party party time.  </p>

                            <p>What health system?  What education system?  What judiciary?  What parliament?  Apparently all that matters is (1)  Where the money goes.  Where the money is.  Who has the money.  Who is kept deprived.  Also (2)  Who gets to do what, now.  Who gets to bully and abuse and rape and torture and so on while the others enjoy that, as sport, one can only suppose, and work real hard to figure the next one to take their place once they've been deposed.  Whack a mole.  It isn't like what they are doing is any different from what anybody else would be doing.  Right?  It's what 'being a winner' is, or looks like.  The only game in town.  Everything it is that we value.  The only thing of any value.  If you think otherwise then you are a loser, therefore.  How you like being appointed as victim for their ongoing crimes?  We can call it a 'social experiment' in how there isn't anything here and there never will be.  No hint of 'try'.  Just take everything you can because you can for as long as you can until you die.  Meaning of life, right there.  They would have things no other way.</p>


                <p> Now that Justice Toogood (pulled out of his retirement for the occasion)  has found that there isn't anything wrong with the Universities of NZ saying that students have  been enrolled in programmes of study that they never even applied to be enrolled in...  The Government wants to record that how many have  been enrolled in MBChB Degree programme?  That's how much debt against their names?  For a programme of study where..  How many was it, Harlene?  1/3rd of the class had graduation withheld -- because the University said that they refused to accept that they had  been signed off as having completed their internship requirement.  Even though it had  been signed off  by international community.  The University of Otago refused to graduate them.  Not exactly a University, hey.  Prison.  Slave.  Detention camp.
                </p>

                <p>Let's all be enrolled in a 'Degree' programme where we can play doctors and nurses and do anything anything anything everything everything Dr Leeks 2.0 says when he says because he says...  Else...  What?  Be imprisoned in the name of 'psychiatry' and fed horse tranquiliser and surgical anasthetics else pronounced 'suicided' all 'voluntary-like'?  What health system?  They can't even / won't even process an application to enroll on the basis of it's academic merits.  They can't even / won't even acknowledge progression through training programmes.  They can't even / won't even graduate people who have done the work that was required for their qualifications.  They won't get the work to external examiners.  They won't allow it to be examined on it's academic merits.  They won't allow international community to sign off.  There's nothing there.  They just won't do it.  Taken over by psychopaths.  Right, Sterelny?  Selfish, selfish, selfish, they're all so f*cking selfish.  Why would anybody help anybody?  What a joke.  It's soooooo competitive!  It's sooooo competitive!  Only over their dead bodies,  hey.  What health system?  What judiciary?  There's nothing there. </p>

                <p>They are being clearer, now, about how it's just a front for the control of people they regard to be sub-persons.  Not person centred, hey.  All about the prevention and prohibition of persons.  Sign the subs up for observational studies or clinical trials or both where at least some are kept in conditions known to be inhumane.  Those who run the studies we can call 'medical doctors' or 'clinical nurses' or..  It really doesn't matter what you call them.  The less education people have, the younger they are when you get them doing anything anything anything everything everything you say when you say because you say...  Pushing and pulling the levers on demand.  Everyone in Australasia would follow the instructions to electrocute someone to death if they thought they would get away with it.  Right?  That's the whole point of these lands?  Don't get sick, now, Chris.  And the only alternative.  Chris.  Right.  The only people who were accepted as candidates for the there is no alternative.  What democracy?  It doesn't seem to matter what any of the laws are because the judiciary refuses to uphold the laws.  Not even trying to be rule by law.  And so, why, then, would international community be constrained by or ruled by international laws when it comes to how they deal or interact with the leaders of New Zealand?  I mean, seriously...</p>

                <p>The great marketing campaign is how kim.com was not extradited to stand trial.  Not even the US.  Come to NZ all the people who might be subject to criminal proceedings overseas.  We have declared ourselves to be a nation where those awaiting trial can come to all voluntary-like.  An entire nation kept in detention.  Shortland Street the media propaganda of how to pass yourself off as a doctor or a nurse or...  Yet another propaganda campaign.  The government wanting to hire people to manage social media accounts for the government.  Don't forget to write a bot to up-vote the politicans everybody!  The government paying people to create dis-information.  Wouldn't pass the bot tests if it tried.  There's nobody home.  Nothing there, hey.  Come to NZ all you graduates of Harvard!  Nobody was ever prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus in NZ even when abortion was in the crimes act as a criminal offence.  And now it's taken out so NZ can be the destination of choice for all those 'knock-out' baby (gene) studies.  All the experiments or observational studies on the long term effects of oxygen deprivation etc for the infants hauled out early (steroids will surely help) and kept in Fisher and Paykal incubators to  be experimented upon.  'I'm soooo glad I'm a gamma baby I don't have to work half as hard as Ashley'.  Made Professor, was he?  Without a PhD or MD.  Without having done the academic work for one.  Without a reserarch thesis.  Without any publications.  Makes sense.  That someone who hadn't done the work would be appointed into position while those who have done the work have their qualifications withheld.  Only treat the involuntary non-voluntary non-consenting.  They have been volunteered.  They have been consented.  What part of it is hard to understand?</p>
