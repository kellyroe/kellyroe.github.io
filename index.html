                <p> Now that Justice Toogood (pulled out of his retirement for the occasion)  has found that there isn't anything wrong with the Universities of NZ saying that students have  been enrolled in programmes of study that they never even applied to be enrolled in...  The Government wants to record that how many have  been enrolled in MBChB Degree programme?  That's how much debt against their names?  For a programme of study where..  How many was it, Harlene?  1/3rd of the class had graduation withheld -- because the University said that they refused to accept that they had  been signed off as having completed their internship requirement.  Even though it had  been signed off  by international community.  The University of Otago refused to graduate them.  Not exactly a University, hey.  Prison.  Slave.  Detention camp.
                </p>

                <p>Let's all be enrolled in a 'Degree' programme where we can play doctors and nurses and do anything anything anything everything everything Dr Leeks 2.0 says when he says because he says...  Else...  What?  Be imprisoned in the name of 'psychiatry' and fed horse tranquiliser and surgical anasthetics else pronounced 'suicided' all 'voluntary-like'?  What health system?  They can't even / won't even process an application to enroll on the basis of it's academic merits.  They can't even / won't even acknowledge progression through training programmes.  They can't even / won't even graduate people who have done the work that was required for their qualifications.  They won't get the work to external examiners.  They won't allow it to be examined on it's academic merits.  They won't allow international community to sign off.  There's nothing there.  They just won't do it.  Taken over by psychopaths.  Right, Sterelny?  Selfish, selfish, selfish, they're all so f*cking selfish.  Why would anybody help anybody?  What a joke.  It's soooooo competitive!  It's sooooo competitive!  Only over their dead bodies,  hey.  What health system?  What judiciary?  There's nothing there. </p>
