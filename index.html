                        <div class="container">

                            <p>I wonder how many people make it here after reading NZ media reports of the legal cases I brought before the courts.  The media reports are a caricature.  The reporters were not present in the court room to hear the proceedings and the written judgments are caricatures of what was filed with the courts.  In particular.  The University of Waikato refused to enrol me in the programme of study that I applied to.  The one I applied to started my enrolment 05 March 2018.  They refused to record my enrolment start date as any earlier than May 2018 -- quite without grounds.  I had started working under supervision (I have evidence of emailed supervision) from 05 March.  They then refused to get my thesis that I submitted for examination in September of 2018 out to externals to prevent them accepting it or saying it was to be accepted within 10 weeks of alterations to the substance in ways they had directed.  The University REFUSED to get it to externals.  They insisted I 'keep working'.  THen they sent the thesis I gave them (a 50,000 words Masters thesis) out with instructions for it to be examined as a 'doctoral thesis'.  They sent it out to be examined for the WRONG QUALIFICATION.</p>

                            <p>How are you supposed to complete a 1 year Masters research project without being forced to re-enrol?  HOw many months are you supposed to work on it before it goes out for external examination?  If it takes externals 3 months to examine it and it is likely they will require  up to 10 weeks of changes to the substance before it is to be accepted then when are you supposed to submit it for external examination?  University of Waikato thinks that you must work for 12 months before submitting it for up to 3 months external exam.  Then, since you are required to be enrolled the day you submit the hard copy you are inevitably required to be re-enrolled and pay more money for enrolment in addition to the 120 point 1 EFT masters qualification that you signed up for.  In other words it is an impossible qualification.  Nobody is allowed to complete a 120 point MPhil in the normal enrolment time.  What university?  Garbage hoax  of a scummy scam.  It wasn't personal to me at all.  This is how 'Universities New Zealand' fails to function.  What education and training system?  There isn't anything there.</p>

                            <p>I never said that since I was a domestic adult who had attained 20 years the Uni of Auckland was forced to enrol me.  I am not stupid.  I know they get more appications than they have places in the programme.  This is why they published an objective selection criterion.  They said that GPA, UMAT / UCAT, and interview score would jointly determine a rank order score.  All I ever asked them to do was enter my info into their selection algorithm and say whether or not my rank order score was high enough for offer of place.  They said that since my GPA came from more than 5 years ago I had to do another qualifiation for 'eligibility'.  That was why I applied to be enrolled in the 120 point MPhil with Waikato.  Because Auckland advised me I was required to do this for 'eligibility'.  SInce they think that Philosophy Degrees become dated.  University qualifications generally depreciate in value until they are obsolete 5 years post-graduation.  Just so you know the value of a NZ University qualification.  The value of overseas University qualifications are, according to them, completely and utterly useless or irrelevant, to be fair.  That is what they think of education.  They refused to enter my GPA correctly.  Refused to do it.  Their words to Waikato over my completing a 120 point qualification in 1 year was: 'you aren't going to let her do that -- are you?'</p>

                            <p>I'ts sooooooooooo competitive.  There simply isn't anything there.</p>

                            <p>Every single complaint received by Chris Whelan (in his capacity as head of the NZVCC) has been deemed, by him, to be a 'personal matter' rather than a complaint of serious wrongdoing.  He isn't performing his statutory function, at all.  </p>

                            <p>This idea of needing to get people onside and 'bring the people with you' is something that can't really happen in an environment that is sooooooooooo competitive...  Soooooooooo competitive.  It's soooooooo competitive.  Certain people must stay on payroll over the age of 65 because nobody else could possibly do their job.  Those people were all removed years ago.  How about the Gloriavale women.  Was their problem that they couldn't 'bring the men with them'?  Was that the problem?  They just couldn't get the men on side with what their aspirations and goals were, etc.  How about slaves or endentured servants?  The problem was that their masters or whatever...  The slaves or endentured servants couldn't bring the people (their masters or whatever) with them.  Riiiiiight.  That's the problem.  Not voluntarily, hey.  Not even trying to be fair and not amenable to reason.</p>

                            <p>Professor Glue's 'Revolutionary' treatment for 'therapy resistent depression' (aka:  The only game in town).  The idea is that after the only kind or type of therapy that the government would fund..  Was it 6 sessions of behavior modification?  Where you use principles of how to train a rat or a chicken or an intellectually handicapped person or a mental health patient or whatever to...  Push a key or make their bed for a food or cigarette reward...  Or after a brief course of cognitive therapy where you...  Provide a list of faulty thoughts and say that they must subscribe to one or more of them and that is why they are depressed because bad thinking causes bad feeling and they just need to think their way into feeling better...  After that kind or sort of talk therapy...  The idea is to give them animal tranquilisers or sedatives.  Drug then unconscious.  Now, tell us, Professor Glue, what do you do to them when they are unconscious?  The reason why I ask is because NZ doesn't seem to be getting the informed consent forms signed before undertaking 'cervical examinations' and other kinds of intimate procedures of that nature.  Now, it is a very very old treatment for 'hysteria' that the (mostly, but not exclusively women) needed to be f*cked.  We can talk about whether these treatments are 'old' or 'new' 'revoluntary' or whatever.  Mostly...  They are inhumane.  Literally...  Taking medication from vet science.  Knocking people unconscious 'feel better'.  Punative.  Punative and dehumanising.  Don't worry -- such treatment isn't limited to psychiatry specifically or particularly.  All the criticisms that the psychiatrists (Szasz, etc) had of psychiatry are actually criticisms that apply to the rest of medicine as well.  Punative system of abuse.  Basically.  We haven't even got to the point or the notion or the idea of rehabilitation.  Theraputic.  Theraputic community or environment.</p>

                            <p>What is the government to do now that it can't simply draft all the children in state care off to die over in the Ukraine?  That's the usual strategy of the NZ government, right?  Grow up.</p>

                            <p>
                            This is a website that I put together relatively quickly so that people can see evidence of some of the things that I have done.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The writing page contains a variety of writing samples where I am the first, or only author.  The samples range from fairly tightly written technical pieces in philosophy and psychology to longer explorations or investigations where the role of the philosopher is supposed to be the 'critic and conscience of society'.  You will find samples of my undergrad and honors research and coursework.  A MA thesis, MPhil thesis, PhD thesis.  A co-authored book chapter.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The seminars page contains more than a dozen seminars that were presented to departmental seminars or international conferences.  I have provided the written version of the talk and powerpoint presentation for the majority of them.  </p>

                            <p>The teaching page provides a list of courses I have taught and the subject contents that I was sub-contracted to develop to help the students understand the contents of a texbook that I was told to teach from.</p>

                            <p>The judicial review page provides a list of legal proceedings that I have filed with various courts of New Zealand.  Presently, the Social Security Appeals Authority is required to pass judgment on whether or not the Ministry of Social Development's decision to refuse to provide advance benefit payment for security for costs set by court of appeal on grounds that 'Justice is not an essential need' is to be upheld or to be overturned.  There was a substantive hearing of this matter in September of 2022 and judgment is awaited.</p>

                            <p>Neil Quigley instructed me to complain to the Office of the Ombudsman and then take the University to Court if I was unhappy with how the University of Waikato handled my enrolment etc in 2018-2019.  I was very unhappy with them (1) refusing to enrol me in the programme I applied to (2) recording I  had been enrolled in programmes I never applied to.  (3)  Refusing to get a thesis that I submitted for examination out to external examiners so as to prevent them accepting it.  (4)  Sending a thesis I submitted for MPhil examination out for 'doctoral reports' to be written (sending it out to be examined for the wrong degree).  (5)  Refusing to base the outcome of external examination on the reports of external examiners.  How could any of this be considered acceptable?  Justice Toogood was reappointed from his retirement to write reports on the untimely deaths of Mason Pendrous and Olivia Podmore.  He was also given his day in court hearing Roe v University of Waikato legal proceedings. </p>

                            <p> New Zealand does not seem to have a functioning tertiary education system.  The 'Universities' are not processing applications to enrol.  They are not acknowledging progression through training programmes.  They are not graduating people who have done the work for their degrees.  I am trying to remember whether ANY of the students at the Australian National University actually had their work go out for external examination at all, or whether the University simply decided that they had done enough for their degrees.  The Australian National University kept Carl Brusse re re re enrolled for more than 10 years as a doctoral student.  Correct?  How many times over did he write doctoral theses for the Australian National University while they only take more and more and more money from the government for keeping him re re re re enrolled.  So that his supposed 'supervisors' can be paid hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of base salary and research funding.  While they refuse to do the supervision job for which they are paid (where is the evidence of my being supervised?  Evidence of meetings?  Evidence of written comments on my written work?)   What education and training system?</p>

                            <p>The University of Auckland is not processing applications to enrol in Medicine properly, at all.  They are throwing away applications when they don't have grounds to.  They don't get to decide whether or not domestic adults are eligible to be enrolled in that programme. The Education and Training Act proclaims that they are eligible.  But the 'Universities' prefer to traffick in teenagers.  Enrolling them in programmes they never applied to, refusing to allow them to be externally examined, deporting them without their qualifications so as to replace them with new studnets.  The new students can be put to work, then, in the name of 'internships' so they can provide research work to the 'university' or nursing work or whatever...  Passing themselves off as doctors in the hospitals and so on...  While they pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the 'Universities' for no supervision and no training.  What tertiary education system?  There doesn't seem to be anything there.  By the time various people take out hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year (particularly people who are over 65 after having taken more than 40 years of government payroll already) there doesn't seem to be anything there.</p>

                            <p>WHERE IS THE MONEY, BUDDY???  WHERE IS THE MONEY??  ONLY OVER YOUR DEAD BODIES, YOU SAY???  HOW MANY  YEARS AM I SUPPOSED TO GIVE YOU WORK FOR PHD CREDIT FFS??  F*CKING PSYCHOPATHS...</p>

                            <p>Apparently I cannot be found to be correct in the High Court Proceedings because I am self-represented and self-represented litigants cannot win costs.  But costs are required to follow the judgment.  So, one man's modus ponens is another man's modus tollens.  I cannot win costs, therefore I cannot be found to be substantively correct.  Justice Fitzgerald was able to award me a reduction in costs against me in virtue of my being technically correct on a technical matter.  What justice is this?  What courts?</p>

                            <p>New Zealand does not seem to have a functioning health system, education system, judiciary.  There really doesn't seem to be anything there.  I don't even see people trying, actually...  WHERE IS MY MONEY, BUDDY?  WHERE IS MY MONEY?  FOR HOW MANY YEARS AM I SUPPOSED TO DO ALL OF THE F*CKING WORK FOR NONE OF THE MONEY?  Where are all the legal aid lawyers who are supposed to represent the students when the 'Universities' refuse to enrol them, acknowledge progression through training, refuse to graduate them after they have done the work for their qualifications?  I guess they aren't graduating lawyers or doctors any more than they are graduating much in the way of anybody else.  How does it go?  Only graduate the ones who cannot do filings.  Is that the idea/l?  </p>

                            <p>So...  What is the government's plan, then, since they aren't going to get their draft of shipping people off to the Ukraine so they can shut up about how much they have been abused at the hands of various government employees who don't seem to do much of anything at all regarding the things they are supposed to do in order for them to be paid.  Just waiting for them to die, we are, apparently.  So that the next generation can live.  I don't know why they aren't willing and or able to share, but the choices they have made.  They kept Carl enrolled for more than 10 years.  Taking his work and getting more and more and more money for having him enrolled.  They stole from him.  Where is my money?  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                            <p>What education and training system?  Apparently medical students have enough time in their day to study medicine, attend their internship, and fitness model group fitness (making up their own flows) in Les Mills Group Fitness classes, every day.  I see Les Mills offers an apprenticeship model of who gets to teach their classes (not).  I don't know how she does it.  Superman!  I don't know how Amy does it.  ER doc and making up her own dance routines?  Spin fitness modelling?  That's what it meeeeeeans to be a medical student or an emergency room physician.  It means spending however many hours of however many days travelling between Les Mills gyms making up your own flows teaching people fitness.  Sure it does.  Yeah, right.  And being a lawyer involves...  Applying for extensions on filing deadlines?  Is that right?  So the judges can say that it isnt' that they are late with their judgments, it's that the lawyers aren't capable of doing their filings.  And the research outputs of those paid to do research at the 'universities' (when they aren't appropriating their studnets work or others journal submissions for their own) is... Uh...  What education and training system?  Fraud upon all of the people?  That one?  WHERE IS THE MONEY, BUDDY?  THE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR QUIGLEY TO REFUSE TO EMPLOY RESEARCHERS.  Where does the research funding go?  The studnet scholarships most often aren't being paid to the studnets at all.  They tell the studnets they didn't get scholarships (for example) when they were supposed to be straightforwardly handed out on the  basis of academic merits.  GPA.  THey refuse to acnowledge GPAs that were awarded to studnets at their own institution ffs.  There's really  nothing there, hey.  Scummy scummy scam.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  WHERE IS THE MONEY, BUDDY????</p>

                            <p>That is a good idea.  For the senior doctors to go on strike.  Get out.  Don't come back.  See ya!  Where are all the studentst that you trained?  GET OUT.  DON'T COME BACK NOW, YA HEAR???</p>
