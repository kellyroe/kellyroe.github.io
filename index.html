                                There is a link to my CV that I have presently under consideration for various things.

                             <p>I will try not to do  anything to break the links.</p>

                             <p>I am file re-formatting my work.  Into tables and columns.  And also organising it into yearly increments.  E.g., </p>

                              <a href="./writing/ks.png">Here is an example of an email from Kim Sterelny (who will not write me a reference) so you can see how he chooses to speak to me.</a> 

                              I collated the 'few small chunks' as he refers to them, here:

                                <p>What does it mean for a hospital (or health system, or university) to have been taken over by militants?  I guess I'd start by looking into how many people receive `medical treatment' against their wishes or against their consent.  How many operations and procedures are performed on the non-voluntary.  For what ever reason. I know they are full of excuses.  They can't write proper patient notes.  They can't read them.  They can't listen.  Their hearing doesn't work so well.  It was an urgent emergency.  They can't keep which patient is which (or which part is which) clear in their heads.  All the complaints received every year (and all the complaints they refuse to acknowledge as having received every year) and all of the `sorries'.  In a system where there `never will be enough to meet genuine need or people's requests for treatment' we are too busy going after people for all the involuntary non-voluntary non-consenting things that we can do.   How do you know when a hospital or a health system has been taken over by militants?  They know what is  best for you.  Or, they will just do whatever it is that they want to do or that they are ordered to do quite irrespective of anything else.  Not really a health system.  Also..  There is opening the cupboards and the cupboards are bare. </p>

                                <p>Not processing graduations.  Not allowing external and independent people to assess the things that are relevant.  Not processing applications.  Just won't do it.  Nothing there.  Nobody home.  Been taken over by militants.</p>
