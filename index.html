                        <div class="container">

                            <p> https://www.seek.co.nz/job/69999879?type=standout#sol=26437d7ee5d9aa8d6a73355485697945bd28bd43  Now the government wants 'managers' (with no academic background in medicine or research) to run the clinical trials and medical experiments to be conducted on 'target populations' (i.e., the gamma babies) in the naaaaaame of 'equity'!  Everybody knows that that's the job of government.  To run medical experiments on people who have no right to protest, object, or not be volunteered.  The government is sooooo busy doing things it's not supposed to be doing (things beyond it's scope) that it doesn't have any time or money or resources left to do any of the things that they're supposed to do.  I guess it makes sense that Ayesha and Shane and Ashley would be graduated from Medicine.  They have how many  hours of clinical practice  between them?  That was why they were graduated -- right?  Because they never would be paid to work that job.  What univesrity?  But then, what government?  What election?  What developed nation?  There really doesn't seem to be anything there...  Can't even / won't even process applications to enrol.  Hurry hurry hurry give everything to the highest bidders from overseas so you can lure them here under false pretenses.  How much does it cost for a South African born person who trained in England to buy for themselves 'New Zealander of the year'?  She was the marketing con-munications face of Medicine -- wasn't she?  So...  Do her 'students' who work in her 'laboratories' with infectious organisms have PPE, yet?  What education system?   Not even trying to be fair.  There's nothing here.  Not even trying to be fair. </p>

                            <p>The thing with the face masks was opening the cupboards -- and seeing the cupboards were bare.  Why is it they are wanting to feed LSD and ketamine and so on to people taken into hospital detention?  Is it because the actual medicines were stolen and sold on the black market etc?  How do you think the doctors and nurses and pharmacists will make their money if you don't pay them?  How is it supposed to go, do you think?  With this wonderful plan that we have to never see evidence of any corruption.  To never perceive corruption.  To never acknowledge receipt of any complaints.  To swiftly cull the people with any concerns.  To teach people that if they speak up then things will become worse, only.  Only that's not true.  When you speak up and see things become worse  you know it isn't that things are becoming worse.  It's just that the cover on how bad things are is being lifted up.  So that how bad things are is made manifest.  Are we trying to make things better?  Really?  Was it 'try' that led to judges being reappointed from retirement (not by proper process)?  Is that what 'trying to be fair' looks like?  Was it 'try' that resulted in the Supreme Court of NZ proclaiming to the world that they didn't know what 'public interest' was...  The word salad that has them pronounce 'what was done was not in the public's interest, at all, therefore it is not in the public interest to administer justice in this context'.  They got that right - it is not in the public interest, at all.  The health system and education system and so on are not in the public interest.  They are not social services.  They are the prevention and prohibition of social services.  They are the underminig of public interest.  They have set about making as many gamma babies who will shut up about the crimes of the over-lords..  The 'we happy few'.  The pedophiles and rapists and bullies and murderers.  The likes of Dr Leeks.  Trafficked about the world as 'most desirable' for purposes, one can only suppose, of population control.  How is that working out?  </p>

                            <p>How are the  natural disasters working out?  Enough funds being freed up to go to the over-lords for their new-builds?  That's the function of goverment, right?  To declare war against the people.  Weather bomb here, weather bomb there.  Targeted experiment there.  Involuntary detention here...  Don't get sick now, ya hear!  Is the world better or worse for you having been in it...  I don't know.  How many will turn up to your funeral to check for themselves..  Is he really dead?  Really?  Really really really?  Party party party time.  </p>

                            <p>What health system?  What education system?  What judiciary?  What parliament?  Apparently all that matters is (1)  Where the money goes.  Where the money is.  Who has the money.  Who is kept deprived.  Also (2)  Who gets to do what, now.  Who gets to bully and abuse and rape and torture and so on while the others enjoy that, as sport, one can only suppose, and work real hard to figure the next one to take their place once they've been deposed.  Whack a mole.  It isn't like what they are doing is any different from what anybody else would be doing.  Right?  It's what 'being a winner' is, or looks like.  The only game in town.  Everything it is that we value.  The only thing of any value.  If you think otherwise then you are a loser, therefore.  How you like being appointed as victim for their ongoing crimes?  We can call it a 'social experiment' in how there isn't anything here and there never will be.  No hint of 'try'.  Just take everything you can because you can for as long as you can until you die.  Meaning of life, right there.  They would have things no other way.</p>


                <p> Now that Justice Toogood (pulled out of his retirement for the occasion)  has found that there isn't anything wrong with the Universities of NZ saying that students have  been enrolled in programmes of study that they never even applied to be enrolled in...  The Government wants to record that how many have  been enrolled in MBChB Degree programme?  That's how much debt against their names?  For a programme of study where..  How many was it, Harlene?  1/3rd of the class had graduation withheld -- because the University said that they refused to accept that they had  been signed off as having completed their internship requirement.  Even though it had  been signed off  by international community.  The University of Otago refused to graduate them.  Not exactly a University, hey.  Prison.  Slave.  Detention camp.
                </p>

                <p>Let's all be enrolled in a 'Degree' programme where we can play doctors and nurses and do anything anything anything everything everything Dr Leeks 2.0 says when he says because he says...  Else...  What?  Be imprisoned in the name of 'psychiatry' and fed horse tranquiliser and surgical anasthetics else pronounced 'suicided' all 'voluntary-like'?  What health system?  They can't even / won't even process an application to enroll on the basis of it's academic merits.  They can't even / won't even acknowledge progression through training programmes.  They can't even / won't even graduate people who have done the work that was required for their qualifications.  They won't get the work to external examiners.  They won't allow it to be examined on it's academic merits.  They won't allow international community to sign off.  There's nothing there.  They just won't do it.  Taken over by psychopaths.  Right, Sterelny?  Selfish, selfish, selfish, they're all so f*cking selfish.  Why would anybody help anybody?  What a joke.  It's soooooo competitive!  It's sooooo competitive!  Only over their dead bodies,  hey.  What health system?  What judiciary?  There's nothing there. </p>

                <p>They are being clearer, now, about how it's just a front for the control of people they regard to be sub-persons.  Not person centred, hey.  All about the prevention and prohibition of persons.  Sign the subs up for observational studies or clinical trials or both where at least some are kept in conditions known to be inhumane.  Those who run the studies we can call 'medical doctors' or 'clinical nurses' or..  It really doesn't matter what you call them.  The less education people have, the younger they are when you get them doing anything anything anything everything everything you say when you say because you say...  Pushing and pulling the levers on demand.  Everyone in Australasia would follow the instructions to electrocute someone to death if they thought they would get away with it.  Right?  That's the whole point of these lands?  Don't get sick, now, Chris.  And the only alternative.  Chris.  Right.  The only people who were accepted as candidates for the there is no alternative.  What democracy?  It doesn't seem to matter what any of the laws are because the judiciary refuses to uphold the laws.  Not even trying to be rule by law.  And so, why, then, would international community be constrained by or ruled by international laws when it comes to how they deal or interact with the leaders of New Zealand?  I mean, seriously...</p>

                <p>The great marketing campaign is how kim.com was not extradited to stand trial.  Not even the US.  Come to NZ all the people who might be subject to criminal proceedings overseas.  We have declared ourselves to be a nation where those awaiting trial can come to all voluntary-like.  An entire nation kept in detention.  Shortland Street the media propaganda of how to pass yourself off as a doctor or a nurse or...  Yet another propaganda campaign.  The government wanting to hire people to manage social media accounts for the government.  Don't forget to write a bot to up-vote the politicans everybody!  The government paying people to create dis-information.  Wouldn't pass the bot tests if it tried.  There's nobody home.  Nothing there, hey.  Come to NZ all you graduates of Harvard!  Nobody was ever prosecuted for wrongful death of a foetus in NZ even when abortion was in the crimes act as a criminal offence.  And now it's taken out so NZ can be the destination of choice for all those 'knock-out' baby (gene) studies.  All the experiments or observational studies on the long term effects of oxygen deprivation etc for the infants hauled out early (steroids will surely help) and kept in Fisher and Paykal incubators to  be experimented upon.  'I'm soooo glad I'm a gamma baby I don't have to work half as hard as Ashley'.  Made Professor, was he?  Without a PhD or MD.  Without having done the academic work for one.  Without a reserarch thesis.  Without any publications.  Makes sense.  That someone who hadn't done the work would be appointed into position while those who have done the work have their qualifications withheld.  Only treat the involuntary non-voluntary non-consenting.  They have been volunteered.  They have been consented.  What part of it is hard to understand?</p>
