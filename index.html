 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                                <p>So apparently Dr Ashley Bloomfield (MBChB) is Professor of the Univesrity of Auckland, now.  He does not have a PhD, any tutoring grading or lecturing experience, academic publications.  Therefore must have.  He must have been the only applicant for the postion.  Nobody with a PhD applied.  Nobody with any tutoring grading or lecturing experiece applied.  Nobody with any academic publications.  They didn't get a single applicant with any experience of working in a Univesrity environment.  Nobody from New Zealand and nobody from overseas.  With all the layoffs that AUT is doing nobody with any university experience applied or was encouraged to apply to become Professor of the University of Auckland.  Ashley Bloomfield was the best candidate for the job.  There isn't any corruption in New Zealand.  No corruption, at all.  Now that the courts have ruled that the Government does't need students to actually apply to courses for the 'University' to record that they have been enrolled in courses (and bill their student loans accordingly).  Now Ashley Bloomfield can be an independent contractor to say that he is recieving all of the government research and teaching award money for all of the research and teaching work that he is so renowned for that he gets to be made Professor of New Zealanads premier University! 
                                </p>

                                <p>I would imagine it is quite the pay cut for him (from around half a million to around a quarter of a mmillion, was it?)  I suppose, then, that the deal will come with sweeteners.  A house?  What else?  How many teenager virgins for Ashley?  But it's soooooooooo competitive and New Zealand Universities are garbage garbage garbage for the bottom feeders with no other options garbage garbage garbage.  So say they all.  AUT is garbage.  Waikato is garbage.  Otago is garbage.  NZ is garbage so Auckland certainly is garbage.  Australia, also, is garbage.  Where the garbage goes that did not get to go to the USA.  And of course the USA is garbage, as well.  Unless you pay the University you pay the University you pay the Univesrity for however many studnets you get to call garbage garbgage garbage.  What an experience!  People who refuse to get your work to externals (presumably because it's garbage) so as to prevent and prohibit you from having credit for your work so that Ashley Bloomfield can be the only applicant. The only game in town.  Wah wah wah NZ doesn't have any Medical Doctors.  Right Ashley?  Wah wah wah.  NZ doesn't have any PhD graduates.  Aren't any in the whole world -- right Ashley?  Well then, that must qualify you for ALLLLLL the jobs.  Allllllll the jobs for the Rt Honorable Dr Ashley Bloomfield MBChB PhD MD BS.  Roll up roll up roll up to be signed up for the population health qualification in how people must take their shots one way or another...</p>

                                <p>I guess the idea is that by promoting NZ as being the bottom of the garbage land it means that it can be the destination for all the experimental research that wouldn't get through the ethics boards of overseas.   Because, you know how it is, we will fill the ethics boards with pedophiles, if need be, to ensure the experiments get to keep rolling along.  That sort of explains the cameras in the ethics and psychology seminars.  How the people on staff hang their heads.  They are trying to see who lacks moral emotions.  That seems to be the ideology of it.  People who don't see anything wrong with atrocities.  Must have for everything in NZ.  MOst desirable place to be a psychopath land.  Real destination for all the garbage.  By design.</p>

                                <p>Stanford is saying now about experiments that were done on black prisoners back whenever.  They had signed consent forms and paid them a token for participating as experimental subjects.  They say that people wanted to participate because they were kept poorly enough such that they would be willing to do anything anything anything for the money.  Right?  Anyway, they are saying that it wasn't okay.  But it was in accordance with the ethics or the norms or whatever at the time.  I mean to say they would only hire employees who had that view of it, of course.  NZ is trying to normalise child abuse and so on so that people don't feel that there is anything particularly bad or wrong sending the pedophiles and the like to NZ.  It isn't like the nations in Australasia aren't fill with moral degenerates, right?  They will fit right on in.  Right?  The only sorts of things we want to know or hear about are how degenerate the people in Australasia are endemically.  We only want to hear about the nasty abuses going on within native communities, mostly, especially, so that we can justify shipping the worst of the degenerates off to the colonies to go research on other people children etc.  Right Ashley?  Did they publically advertise your job, then?  Really?  How many applicants were there for your job?</p>

                                <p>So Ashley did a Masters in Public Health.  Was that a 1 year research only masters or a 2 year Masters with maybe 1 year of coursework and a 1 year research component?  How many weeks months years did they get you working on your research component?  2 years?  Before they took another year to examine it?  You mean to say they made you take a PhD length of time (3 years including the examination period) to do 1/2 the work of a PhD?  Did they tell you that was the pathway to becoming an academic?  Did you even write a thesis?  What was your thesis about?  I'm curious because of Stuart McCutcheons being about breeding more lambs than you can feed so you can cry cry cry to the government for more money every winter else the lamb hostages will starve.  Then you use that money you got from the government for fattening them up for the spring slaughter for increased profits for yourself.  Then cry cry cry for more money from the government because you bred more lambs than you would feed through the winter unless the government gave you more and more and more money to feed them through the winter...  Quite the business marketing managing model for the University of Auckland.  Really desirable place for the very very best and brightest of the NZ studnets.  Wouldn't you say?  Must have.  Must have all the best and the brightest studnets of NZ.  Wouldn't you say?  Cry cry cry cry cry for more money from the Government for keeping the lambs going off to the slaughter.  All the Professorships for Ashley!</p>

                                <p>I suppose the idea is that it doesn't matter.  Ashley doesn't need to have a PhD to refuse to supervise studnets in their PhD research.  You can't supervise students in doing a higher level qualificiation than one you have.  Apparently that's why we don't have MD or JD research in NZ.  There isn't anybody with those qualifications to supervise those Degrees.  They are in the University Calendar for a couple of the NZ Universities, but to the best of my knowledge they don't enrol anybody in, supervise, or graduate anybody from those qualifications.  They also don't seem to be enrolling, progressing, or signing off on PhD qualifications, either.  They won't get the students work out to externals.  They won't do it.  They won't help the student get PhD.  The people collecing up all the research money don't want to share.  They want to be the only game in town.  It's sooooooo competitive.  </p>

                                <p>Most if not all of the research projects seem intentionally designed to showcase that the students are lacking in morality and / or integrity and / or knowledge and ability etc etc.  They call them 'terminal degrees' or 'terminal qualifications' because then your right to life, or something, is declared to be given up.  See, your only value is the value that you have to the University that the University can cry for more and more and more and more money from the Government for recording your enrolment and reenrollment and reenrollment and reenrollment nd reenrollment nd reenrollment collecting up more and more and more money.  What is in it for the NZ government?  Every studnet hostage does not count for unemployment or disability stats.  You say they are in 'education and training' programmes.  THen you intentionally record higher and higher and higher levels of debt against their name while refusing to get their work to externals and paying internal people to bully and abuse them.  Worst case you record that you have successfully disabled or handicapped them.  Still don't count for unemployment.  How many FTE positions, in NZ, again?  To be filled by how many people?  How many FTE positions for Ashley?  How many years did he take to complete his 1 year of research research component on his Masters?  Oh, let me guess, Auckalnd lacks the capacity to keep accurate student enrolment records and lacks the capacity to keep transcripts.  What a f*cking joke.</p>

                                <p>You see all the 'must haves' passing themselves off as Medical Doctors, in NZ.  One can only suppose they are paying sums of money in exhange for committing atrocities against the people of NZ.  It is convenient for wrongful deathbringing pedophiles to pass themselves off as Medical Doctors and teachers and the like, for obvious reasons.  THe Universities of NZ are refusing to process applications properly.  What Universities?  What skilled workers?  NZ intentionally sells out the people in order to be, effectively, the prison camp detention land of all the psychopaths shipped here from overseas.  Why the hell did we need to pay someone from England to be Dean of the Research School of the Univesrity of Waikato?  What she does is falsely record student enrolments (by saying that studnets will never get their qualifications unless they reenroll and reenroll and reenroll and reenroll and pay more and more and more money to the University) so as to double bill and keep false enrolment records and then hoard the f*cking theses and not get them out for external examination.  HOw much money do they pay the f*cking psychopath?  Why are we paying a foreigner to undermine the entire f*cking university?  THey don't have the willingness and or ability to get out of the f*cking way of their research students.  It isn't a univesrity.  THey won't do it.  Can't / won't employ anybody willing and or able to supervise graduate student research?  Can't and won't even pay people to get out of the f*cking way so that some actual f*ckign research could be f*ckign done for a f*cking change.  What is the research output of the people paid to do research?  How f*cking slow can they possibly work?  Their first year students output more research than they do ffs.  It really isn't supposed to be that f*cking hard.</p>

                                <p>So, someone with a PhD from the Australian National University (supposedly Australasias Premier Research Institution) says that having a PhD from the ANU really isn't that big of a thing or a deal.  He says that once you have your PhD you realise how many people in the world have a PhD and having one doesn't really mean anything at all.  You see the people who have PhD's and you meet them and see the work they are doing and have done and so on and you realise that having a PhD doesn't really mean anything.  I mean...  I suppose from his perspective, he had a PhD from the ANU but no academic jobs came to him.  No academic job from any University in New Zealand, particularly.  NZ or Australia.  I guess once the likes of Ashley Bloomfield take the academic positions there aren't any jobs left for anybody else.  I guess he wasn't thinking, particularly, about what it means, then, of the people who worked on their PhD for however many years and were never credited as having done enough work for one.  The idea is that when you look at the shit they say is good enough for one then you wonder just how shitty the real shit is when the shit doesn't even get credit for having done one.  They don't really think that a test that gives false negatives...  And what do we call this situation, then?  False positiives?  Attesting to the complete and utter worthlessness and meaninglessness of the whole entire enterprise.  I mean...  Who has their PhD and who doesn't does not appear to be associated with who has actually done the work.  Does not appear to be associated with the quality of the work.  Does not appear to be associated with who the examiners said should have their PhD (if they even get the work out to externals or if the decisions are being made in spite or or despite what externals have to say).  I mean to say there doesn't appear to be anything home...</p>

                                <p>So what are we left with, then?  Well.  A holding facility or detention camp for teenagers, primarily.  Takes children when they are 18.  Or as low as 14, if we are talking about AUT when it came to at least one finance studnet from Vietnam who came to NZ with her not biological Mother legal guardian...  Apparently...  They don't hire University graduates (Ashley doesn't have a PhD but he's supposed to head a graduate research school, now?)  They have no intention of producing University graduates..  It's just another NZ government institution of abuse.  The Australian National Univesrity appears to be just another Australasian institution of abuse.  By design.  Intentionally.  They collected up more and more and more and more money for having studnets enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled.  They refused to get the studnets work to externals in a timely fashion.  They intentionally seemed to move faculty around so as to say that students had been abandoned by their supervisors so they would need to start a new project again under a new supervisor or they would  never qualify to complete their qualification.  I'm looking at all the work that I did (the write ups of talks etc over on the seminars page) and wonder how many people basically took my research output and claimed it as their own and passed it off as their own overseas.  Back in the northern hemisphere or wherever.  NZ Universities handed all their studnets intellectual property over to Turnitin.  Got all of their students intellectual property uploaded into Turnitin.  So that they could fail the studnets out so that other people could go on to claim it as their own work outputs.  Who is Turnitin?  Some American company, apparently.  So that the Professors from American Universities can be attributed with what they think is the best of the work, I suppose.  Which necessitates the elimination of the person who produced it.  Or maybe just relegate them to the garbage wasteland of garbage land.  So that you can feel better about yourself.   Becuase it's sooooooo competitive.  It's sooooo competitive that NZ doesnt' even have journals.  The Philosophy Professor of the Univesrity of Auclkand gets to publish in the NZ Meidcal Students Journal (don't worry Ashley can publish in the academic journals, next, for all the hard work that he's done spending so much of his life working his way up through academia at great cost to himself.  All the investment that he has made of himself all the sacrifies he has  made.  The financial hits in doing jobs in the public service interests.  Not at all folling the path of where the money goes and where the little 18 year old virgins can be...  Drafted?  Drafted to his programme of study?  So that he can refuse to sign them off becuase it's a 'terminal masters' programme where the little researchers go to die so that alllll of the money can be given to Ashley MBChB.  Why doesn't he work with patients?  They pay him to not work with patients.  I suppose some foreigner will pay him...  Half a million dollars?  For...  1 year?  Of getting to play doctors and nurses in the NZ hospitals?  10 weeks of Orthopedic surgeon?  How much money to dump your wife at Hillmorton for the rest of her life, these days?  Just so we understand why the 'Universities' of NZ can't / won't process an application to enrol, progresseion through training, completion of trining.  Can't  / won't publically advertise jobs.  Can't / won't hire people for the jobs.  Can't / won't pay the workers.  Only the pedophile psychopaths need apply stating how much money they will invest in NZ in order to do anything anything anything they want with impunity.  We don't see any corruption, at all...</p>

                                <p>I actually don't know that we are graduating any.  Doctors.  Lawyers.  Engineers.  I think that they wait until they get people who have been struck off from overseas for atrocities and they get them.  Why?  Because they will pay and pay and pay and pay to apply for visas and the like to come to NZ.  Then we can put them to 'work' and not really pay them.  What are they going to do about our not really paying them?  They could leave, then.  We can simply replace them with a new lot of people who have been struck off from overseas because of atrocities.  That makes the worlds offenders most highly desirable, from a NZ point of view.  They can come here and be put to work.  Then we can simply not pay them.  What are they going to do?  If they protest we can take their visa back and deport them.  Are they going to go home and cry about it?  We are only interested in having the ones who are on the radar for atrocities overseas in the first place.  I would imagine or suppose.  So they can't go home and complain.  What do you expect trying to do business with psychopths?  How could you not have expected to be screwed over?  Well...  I suppose you point to high profile people..  Allegedly or apparently Dawn Freshwater is a foreigner who is apparently or alledgedly actually paid half a million NZ dollars per year to play VC of the Univesrity of Auckland.  Why would we believe that?  How does that make any sense?  Allegedly or apparently the Dean of the Research School of the Univesrity of Waikato is paid a few hundred thousand per year in order to hoard theses and refuse to get them to external examiners and refuse to get external examiers the sign off forms and refuse to allow external examiners to sign off that students have done enough for the 120 point research project they applied to be enrolled in.  Why would we believe that they pay her several hundreds of thousands to do that?  Maybe she makes quarter or half a million for the University from the false records and billings?  Is that how it doesn't work?  Is that how the University of Waikato gets to be in it's place as one of the shittest Universities with little to no research output? </p>

                                <p>I guess the money isn't just from the NZ Government.  I was like 'what is in it for the NZ government?'  I mean, they pay the University for keeping the student enrolled.  Well, they don't provide a government job for rhte student who is kept enrolled.  They don't have a graduate level entry job with the government.  So the government pays the University less money than the government would pay the student for keeping the student enrolled.  Why would the student do that?  Who in their right mind would voluntarily consent to that?  Well, then, better collect up more and more money from the government for keeping the student in teh psychiatric hospital.  How many FTE positions are there, in NZ?  To be distributed to how many people?  I mean to say that some people are working more than 1 FTE (are collecting up more than 1 FTE salary) while others are not allowed to do 1 EFT of work in 1 year.  Not because they don't have the capacity or the willingness.  They refuse to allow anybody to do it.  NZ does not have uniersities.  That means we don't have law, engineering, medicine graduates.  We don't have an eudcation and training system.  We have a fraud or a hoax upon all the people.  THe prison camp detention land of the owrld.  Australia thinks it's doing better thn NZ but it isn't.  The f*cking think tank brought to you by Wellington shipped to Canberra ffs?  Selfish selfish selfish.  So f*cking selfish.  </p>

                                <p>Jacinda read out some speech where she told the graduating class of Harvard that the abortion laws were recently changed, in NZ.  They can easily check and find out that nobody was prosecuted, in NZ, for having performed one, when it was techincally a criminal offence.  That tells them everythign tehy need to know about NZ's place in the world as the place where you want to pay a bit of money (not a lot of US dollars) to go do anything anyting anything with impunity.  Jacainda also did an interview when she was offered a fat cheque from Harvard which she apparently chose to convert into a 2 year masters for a student to go to the..  Kennedy school of leadnership or something.  Some Jacinda Ardern scholarship or something.  To the value of more than $200,000 NZD apparently.  For a 2 year masters, one can only suppose...  Who was the recipient, then, of the Jacinda Ardern Scholarship for a student to go to Harvard?  What student went to Harvard?  Who picked which student?  How did they select the student?  When did they graduate?  Did they write a thesis?  What thesis was attributed to them?  I am wondering becuase I am wondering if it is just more documentation of corruption.  I mean to say...  Let's see..  Jacinda announces a Masters scholarship for a student to go to Harvard for a Masters qualification...  And then next thing you hear (a year two later) Jacinda Ardern is collecting up an Honorary Degree for herself.  I am wondering what student received the scholarship and what student got what qualification?  What is the student doing now?  Did they get an entry level job with the NZ government after graduating from Harvard with the Jacinda Ardern Masters Degree?  Or was the whiole thing just a demonstration of how corrupt the NZ governmetn is.  That Jacinda took (honorary aka she did not do the work for one) qualifiation for herself (titles, she got.  Not PhD a title that indicates that she has an honorary title is what her honorary title indicates).  I'm wondering what (if any) receipient tehre was of the 2 year Masters from Harvard?  Did NZ send a 18 year old to Harvard??  Did they come back?</p>
