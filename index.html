                            <p>I wonder if the leader of China will tell Chris Hipkins to 'go home to his master' (as Winston Peters said about the leader of Taiwan) since it is in the Australian Constitution that NZL is the second named state which makes Chris not the leader of a Country, but of a state.  Actually I don't wonder.  We all know that the leader of China would not be so unprofessional as that.</p>

                            <p>We are supposed to believe that Jacinda voluntarily chooses to resign from the position that she has been elected to...  On the grounds of burn-out...  But now she's ready to work on a million dollar book contract for foreigners.  Instead of returning to her duties as elected Prime Minister of New Zealand to finish up her elected term?  HOw long is she supposed to take to write her book?  A decade?  Two?  Maybe $50,000 per year over 20 years... What is the value of a post-honorary-doc position, these days?  Only writing.  No research.  No teaching.  </p>

                            <p>Surely Justice Toogood isn't still paying off a mortgage.  On his 7th investment property after he paid off the mortgage on his 7 bedroom family home and his holiday house, perhaps...</p>

                            <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/492586/lack-of-data-on-medical-workforce-suicides-te-whatu-ora  Nonononono, you have to say it like this 'suicides'.  You can also say it like this 'people who have  been suicided'.  You know, all voluntarily-like.  Of course witnesses might upload evidence of the 'suicide' -- which would be swiftly declared unlawful and taken down.  As would any crime-scene forensic information posted by cleaners, say.  Such that people could consider whether the method claimed by the state appears to be consistent with the footage supplied by third party cameras and the like. </p>

                           <p> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/492602/thousands-of-acc-cases-probed-for-misuse-but-only-seven-prosecutions  I told ACC about the Auckland District Health Board incorrectly billing for me.  They billed ACC, saying I had conditions and they gave me treatments that were complete and utter fabrications.  I did not sign the consent form for any of it.  It was a complete and utter hoax.  I told the ACC and they just don't care.  It is like when you tell the IRD that the University is trying to have you charged for a programme of study that you never applied to.  They just don't want to hear it.  Unwilling / unable to keep accurate health records.  Of course they want to cry cry cry about the 65+ year old people who are still working to pay the bills.  The issue is not the 65+ people on the payrates that are needed to pay the reasonable bills, in fact.  The issue is the 65+ people on hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.  Judges that are suppose to have gotten out.  45 + years of highly paid employment as Judge ffs.  Time to get out.  Are we really expected to believe that the former speaker of the house was basically forced to be diplomat to Ireland because he's still trying to pay off his f*cking mortgage?  Ffs.  Time to get out.  Kim Sterelny and wife.  How old?  Time to get out.  Ffs.  It isn't exactly rocket science.  Interesting, though, to learn (maybe -- I'm skeptical of stats because they are often made up) that we have a higher proportion of retirement age people who refuse to get out than the USA.  I am interested in the breakdown of that regarding how many of them are living in houses where there is no mortgage on that home (thought I guess it is complicated when people buy investment property to have rental income as their own income by remortgaging their own home). </p>

                           <p>You  need to look at how the DHB's are billing ACC, rather than scapegoating a few individuals.  E.g., keeping people for cardiac observation in cardiology rooms when they have no grounds to suspect anything cardiac is wrong with them.  Ramping patients to keep the beds full to maximise their billings.  The cases of apparent or alleged fraud by particular individuals are NOTHING in comparaison to the systematic fraudulent billings by the DHB's.  similarly, I would imagine they are billing for surgeries that never were performed.  Placebo.  Give anasthetic. Make a surgical cut.  There's your placebo surgery.  Feel better.  That will be the cost of a full surgery, thanks.  Sign off on your surgical training, will we?  Yeah, right...</p>

                           <p>I guess the issue for me is the realisation that there simply isn't anything in healthcare or education...  Anything to do with vulnerable people.  Students.  Sick people.  Poor people.  Ethnic minority people. There just isn't any kind of shortage at all of people wanting identify vulnerable targets and get in there and take them for everything they have got.  We won't actually pay anybody to work those jobs (for or in the interests of the above people) because there never will be any kind of shortage at all of psychopaths who want to get in there and exploit them for everything they have.  So...  The positions will be filled with psychopaths.  Volunteers.  People who will 'yes sir yes sir everything you say sir' in exchange for getting to do anything anything anything.  The most valued Dr Leeks.  Moved to to Melbourne to better facilitate his continued ongoing crimes.  Most valuable employee ever.  This eye surgeon guy who is cohorting with Sydney prostitutes.  Let him be a motivation and inspiration to a bunch of young men who otherwise never would have considered Medicine as a viable profession, at all.  All the people he trained over the years?  Yeah, right.  </p>

                           <p>The recent inquiry into abuse in state care shows the lengths that the NZL government and judiciary will go to to ensure that NZ is the destination location for abusers and offenders and psychopaths and pedophiles...  It simply won't do anything about historic cases, even, and there is no intention whatsover of stopping with present abuses or developing any kind of education and training system or professional graduates with professsional careers.  There simply isn't anything here and there is no desire to develop, at all.  Can't function.  Taken over by psychopaths.  Not even trying to do things properly.  On shore prison camp detention land of Australia.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  Hire all the con-municators to say they can't see anything wrong.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                           <p>So... Usually the question from the rich people's spoiled kids is 'how much money would it cost to be leader of a little island far away from the laws and courts and so on of the USA so I can do anything anything anything I want...  Child porn..  Whatever drugs..   Torture.  ANything anything anything.  How much would it cost?'  To set yourself up as Epstein on the aptly named virgin islands.  Or maybe NZ.  How much money would it take to buy the election outright?  How much did kim.com think he could win it for?  I'm not sure...  But the point is that that usually is the idea.  How much money it would cost to have yourself positioned as dictator, basically, of an island.  How much money would it cost?  And we are expected to believe that Jacinda chooses to walk away from her position of leadership for a mere million dollars?  Makes no sense, hey.  Or, is she writing a defence of her actions for international community?  I guess the idea is that if they are all criminals they can all be removed from office at any time without much of any fuss.  Because you have the evidnece to prosecute them.  Like ensuring you only sign off on completion of Medical Degrees, say, once you have collected up enough evidence of them doing non-consenting procedures etc.  </p>

                           <p>The Junior Doctor from Dunedin (only one they would employ it's sooooo competitive) who was giving drugs he got from the hospital to teenagers.  Who killed one of the teenagers when she didn't want to have sex with him and threatened to tell everyone that he was doing these things...  The Junior Doctor who allegedly suicided in state care.  In prison.  There wasn't an open casket funeral so the parents of his victims could be satisfied that he actually was dead.  Was there?  He didn't just pay some sum of money in the form of bribe to flee.  Maybe to be relocated to Melbourne and set up with all the resources that he needed to drug teenagers and murder them off, over there?  The idea never would have occurred to me, but that seems to be the main motivating and inspiring reason to do Medicine, in NZ.  Wouldn't you say?  The courts don't see anything wrong with it...</p>
