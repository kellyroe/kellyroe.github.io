                                There is a link to my CV that I have presently under consideration for various things.
                             </p>

                             <p>I will try not to do  anything to break the links.</p>

                             <p>I am file re-formatting my work and organising it into yearly increments.  E.g., </p>

                             <p>
                              <a href="./writing/ks.png">Here is an example of an email from Kim Sterelny (who will not write me a reference) so you can see how he chooses to speak to me.</a> 

                              I collated the 'few small chunks' as he refers to them, here:
                              </p> 

                                <p><a href="./publish/2013-rep.pdf">Roe, (2013).  A few small chunks for 2013.</a>
                                </p>

                                <p>Did you win, Sterelny?  Did you manage to starve the humanity out of me?  I'm just begging to house-sit for you and go away on camping trips.  It's sooooo important to my career to do anything anything anything.  Did Carl graduate, yet?  For how many decades did you get him house-sitting for you?</p>

                                <p>How  many years did Dave Wall give Daniel Stoljar doctoral work -- before he was hospitalised, given dextrose or glucose before thiamine, which put him into a coma so he nearly died?  How many years was he handing over doctoral work before things deteriorated to that point?</p>

                                <p>The whole time I was at the ANU I didn't see anybody with reports from external examiners.  Nobody had their work go out for external examination -- did they?  I didn't see anybody (from any department)  have a scheduled oral examination or defence.  No public defenses.  I don't remember seeing anybody in a doctoral gown for graduation, either.  Did people actually get conferred qualifications?  How?  How are some people getting paid employment for post-doctoral fellowship positions?  People other than Jacinda Ardern, I mean.  How are people getting visas etc?</p>

                                <p>What education and training system?  There's nothing there.  Not even trying to be fair, at all.  What a f*cking hoax of a scummy scam.  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>Waikato won't send work out to externals, either, else if they do they won't listen to what externals have to say.  My external requested an oral defense (after they asked him to write reports of it for the wrong qualification) then he seems to have forgotten what year it is requesting an oral defense to be held in his report of 2012.  What education and training system?  There's nothing there.</p>
