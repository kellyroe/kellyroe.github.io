                            <p>Ayesha wants to make medicine 'more attractive' by relating how the first time she killed a patient, nobody talked to her.  Wow.  Is that what you have to do to get people to stop talking to you (given the things that fall out of their face-holes)?  You just gotta get in there (those state care institutions) and kill!  Kill!  Kill!  Why don't you work as a Medical Doctor Ayesha?  Person who took up a training place.  Person ranked high up their hierarchy according to the criterion they publish for the purposes of them telling the world how they refuse to be accountable.</p>

                            <p>Note that people are not doing business in this jurisdiction.  Our leaders travelled to the USA and to China and signed contracts in their jurisdication so they can be held accountable to their courts.  And their militaries, one can only suppose.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>
