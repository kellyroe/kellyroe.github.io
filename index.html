                            <article>


                                <p>
                                My Australian National Student Records are  being made available to me and I am looking through them to see what went wrong with my candidature.  It seems I am fairly forced to follow things up with that (see about getting credit or completing) since New Zealand has resoundingly determined that there is nothing here for me.  New Zealand instructed me to complete a new qualification from New Zealand for purposes of entry to Medicine in New Zealand (as a non-Australian Citizen I can't pursue Student Loans or Allowances in Australia for Medical School over there).  I applied to be enrolled in a 120 MPhil with Waikato for that purpose.  Waikato thought their job was to prevent and prohibit me completing the 120 point MPhil and they did various things towards that ends including refusing to get theses I submitted for examination (against my supervisors advice) on 3 separate occasions and sending a submitted thesis out to be examined for the wrong qualification on another occasion.  The reason they had for not supporting me submitting my thesis was they said I was trying to complete it 'under time' and my supervisor was not done with me yet.  
                                </p>

                                <p>The Education and Training Act 2020 (and previous iterations) states that domestic adults are eligible for progammes they apply to.  As such, the University of Auckland had no right to inform me that I was required to undertake a new qualification from a NZ University for purposes of eligibility.  They were happy enough to use my full-time grades from my previous study -- when they thought they were too low for my competitive ranking (GPA, UMAT / UCAT, interview score) to be competitive.  Once I pointed out that they were calculating my GPA differently from how they said they would calculate it in their published algorithm they said my grades did not count, anyway,  becuase I was not eligible to apply to that programme.  
                                </p>

                                <p>It is all obvious nonsense that shows the University of Auckland not to be making decisions on the basis of their published algorithm, at all.  The reason they discredit my (older) grades is because they did not have a role to play in grade-fixing them (e.g., failing me out of the University).  I have more recent grades from them (that necessitated me withdrawing from the University in order not to mess up my full-time GPA) where they were willing to fail me for first year population health essays and overall course.  They are not even pretending to be a University upholding internationally accepted standards or values of academic scholarship.  Corruption.  I never would have returned to New Zealand if I knew how corrupt Medical Admissions was.  I returned because I believed my full time GPA would likely be enough for me to get a place by way of competitive entry and I beleived it may be possible for me to be supported through the Medical Training Programme with some form of government living benefit and Studnet Loans.  Work and Income and Student Loans seemed all to be supportive of my goals.  I did not realise that everybody thought I was intellectually handicapped, or something, and they were humoring me only, they were never going to enrol me in that Degree.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                It's basically a scam, anyway.  New Zealand, I mean.  They will not pay their workers.  There is no education and training system, here.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I have a phone meeting with the Social Security Authority about how they are refusing to grant me advance benefit so as to pay all the costs that the court of appeal has ordered me to pay to have various cases against New Zealand Universities and the New Zealand Vice Chancellor's Committee heard on appeal.  It seems to me that justice was not done in any of the High Court Proceedings.  There is evidence of fact and statements of laws that the judges refused to consider.  But this is all just wasting my time.  New Zealand is a costly fitness trap is all it is.  There isn't anything here.  It does not make sense that there be Medicine, here, because they don't want the people to live.  It's sooooooo competitive.  They can't kill the people fast enough.  Most of them.  The idea that people might actually have help...  Doesn't compute in these parts.  Education is only about having people pay the University, pay the University, pay the University.  You put them to 'work' acting as doctors and nurses and sterile supply technicians etc in the hospitals...  And they don't pay you for the work that you do, you pay them to play doctors and nurses.  And then, when it's time for you to be given you Degree, it is time for you to be failed (repeat the year) or deported (get out of the country).  And when they really can't squeeze any more money out of you then it's time for you to go away.  To be replaced by a new student who can pay the University, pay the University, pay the University.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                They will need managers and administrators and spin-doctors and so on for this little scummy scam to thrive...  I guess that's the real test, isn't it?  If you want to buy in to this system.  The keeping of slaves.  Bonded servants.  The prevention and prohibition of the development of health or education or meaningful work or...  Justice.  Pay the courts, Ms Roe.  Pay the courts, pay the courts, pay the courts, pay the courts, pay the courts.  Take a look at the Supreme Court Judgements i've received.  There's nobody home nothing here.  We don't have a functioning judiciary.  THey won't pay the lawyers.  They won't pay the victims.  The Government and Universities and Hospitals etc will choose to pay people to defend their actions so they can continue on with their crimes.  New Zealand functions as an off-shore detention camp of Australia is all.  Since I returned here from Australia without my PhD they treat me like I'm intellectually handicapped or something.  I have been disabled.  I lose the great competition of life!  You win New Zealand:  You don't have health, education, or justice.  Good Job!  Yay you!
                                </p>



                                <p>With respect to Roe v University of Waikato Justice Toogood (pulled out of retirement for the occassion because that's what 'independence of the judiciary' means) asserts that they were entitled to refuse to get my thesis out for external examination on the grounds that I submitted it 'too early'.    The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications.  They define a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  
                            <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a> 
                            </p>

                            <p>The University of Waikato offers a 120 point MPhil qualification.  That means it has been approved by the TEC as being 'right sized'.  The academic quality and integrity people, the NZVCC approved the qualification.  It is listed in the University Calendar.  I applied to be enrolled in it.  The University refuses to allow anybody to complete that qualification, however.  They believe they are entitled to require studnets to work for at least 12 months on their thesis before undergoing an external examination period of up to 3 months.  Since you are required to be enrolled at the end of the external examination period that means that if the examination period takes 3 months then you are required to be enrolled in and pay fees for an enrolment period of 12 months plus 3 months for a total of 15 months.  But it doesn't stop there.  They believe that if the external examiners say anything about changes needing to be made to the substance (e.g., a referene to be added, a section to be moved around) then they are entitled to require the studnet to re-enrol for an additional 6 months and also undergo another external examination period of up to 3 months.  That means another 9 months added.  Basically forcing the student to repeat the f*cking year.  They say that the outcome of what they like to call 'first examination' is always that the student is required to pay fees for another 9 months.  This is fairly inevitable.  That is to say, they offer the 120 point qualification with the expectation that students will end up working for at least 12 months plus 3 months plus 6 months plus 3 months for a total of 24 months (2 years).  What happens then depends a  bit on the university.  Waikato has this 'option' for the university administration whereby the studnet takes another 2 1/2 months to make minor changes.  Find another reference.  Move a comma.  Etc.  The University administration believe they have discretion to force this -- else they can say the studnet failed to meet their requirements and the qualification is withheld.  
                            </p>


                            <p>
                                I think it is important for international community to know that this is going on in NZ Universities.  The High Court was informed and they refused to put things right in a timely fashion.  They believe that this behavior is appropriate academic quality and integrity for NZ Universities.  This is partiuclarly important information for international studnets who may find their visas expiring (anad them required to leave the country without their degree).  I'm sorry.  New Zealand Universities seem to have decided that they are entitled to run this scam.  This is the scam they are running.  I have posted the evidence as to how they treated me.  You can see in teh courts judgments that the courts believe they are not treating me any differently from how they treat other studnets.  The courts also state that they do not think that this matter that I bring before the courts is a matter of public interest and they also think that the matter that I bring before the courts is one that I cannot win.  There are no merits to my case.  I also post about how I paid the fees associated with filing in the tenancy tribunal on a different matter.  The outcome was declared 'suppressed' by the courts.  That is to say, I paid the fees the court set without questioning or applying for consideration of exemption and even after receiving the filing fee money the courts refused to find in the interests of justice.  There does not appear to be precedent that paying the fees they demand will actually result in them processing or progressing things properly.  It is just more money for them, is all.
                            </p>

                            <p>Here is how much the Inland Revenue now says I owe the New Zealand Government for my 'Education' and 'Training' that are not acknowledged because New Zealand qualifications apparently expire 5 years post-graduation (well, not the Judges law degrees, apparently, but my qualifications have expired): 
  
                            <a href="judicial-review/ird-shot.pdf" target="_self"> $104,663.</a>

                            They have not provided a break-down of what courses they recorded me as having been enrolled in, in what year.  I have transcripts for some years that I will upload.  They acknowledge that I have completed BA(hons) and an MA (I can't tell whether they invoiced 1 year or 2 years or more of fees total for the MA - it looks to me from my transcript that they may have double-billed).  They refuse to acknowledge that I have completed anything since then.  They keep invoicing my student loan -- for courses that I never applied to be enrolled in (changing enrolment dates for more billings for them which make me look like I'm slow).  They take my research work, particularly, and give it to third parties without crediting me (or paying me).   
                            </p>

                            <p>The Education and Training Act 2020 (and previous iterations of the Act) all state that domestic adults who have attained the age of 20 years are eligible to be enrolled in whatever programme they apply to.  The Act states that when a programme is over-subscribed (more applicants than available places) then the University may use a selection criterion.  The University of Auckland published a selection criterion involving GPA, UMAT / UCAT, interview score.  They informed me that they were happy to use the grades from my previously completed qualifications -- so long as I completed a further qualification for the purposes of 'eligibility'.  They said that I was required to complete the MPhil for 'eligibility'.  But this is false.  As a domestic adult I was eligible all along.  THey were therefore required to apply tehir selection criterion to my application regardless of whether or not I had completed a qualification in the last 5 years.  They don't get to decide who is and who is not eligible.  The source of eligibility is the statute and not their discretion.  The University and the courts simply refuse to hear this.  They refuse to summarise this way of putting things or seeing things or stating things in their judgments.  THey refuse to accept my obviously correct characterisation of the issue. 
                            </p>

                            <p>Otago, too, thinks they get to decide what students they will enroll in what programme for whatever arbitrary (including discrimatory) reasons they want.  They don't believe that international standards apply to them or to their conduct.  Look at the choices they make (e.g., Dr Leeks).  The untrainable qualities that they value.
                            </p>

                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.
                            <a href="judicial-review/otagoappeal.pdf" target="_self"> Ms Roe's Submissions for Roe v University of Otago (Court of Appeal) </a>  They aren't progressing the filings. They are refusing to supply applications, refusing to process applications on their academic merits.  Apparently it isn't a matter of public interest how they pick and choose people to pass themsleves off as 'doctors' in our hospitals.
                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  Demanding me to pay more and more and more money to the courts else they force all my cases aborted, or abandoned.  <a href="judicial-review/sc-eyes.pdf" target="_self"> Here is the Judgement of the Supreme Court that I am attempting to appeal on the grounds that it is manifestly grotesquely unjust. </a>  It is like they have their eyes poked out.  Our highest court does not seem to have the conception of justice, at all.  It was the courts decision to delay Roe v University of Waikato proceedings until AFTER Roe v NZVCC and also until AFTER Roe v University of Auckland.  The Judge for Roe v NZVCC made all kinds of pronouncement in his judgment on the matter of Roe v University of Waikato.  That is to say instead of judging the issue he was supposed to be judging (the inaction of Chris Whelan in his capacity as CE of the NZVCC) he thought he would weigh in on whether or not I had done enough for completion of the MPhil Degree.  Clearly that is a matter of the Judge of a different case to decide!  The reasoning seems to be 'we don't choose you, Ms Roe.  If that means we declare you non-person criminal then that is what we do to justify the fact that we don't choose you'.  This country is not even pretending to be rule by law.  It runs on 'exceptions' or 'exemptions' only (that need to be begged, bribed, else stolen) so far as I can see.  The Supreme Court refused to appoint an aimicus to ensure there was no miscarriage of justice.  Refused to appoint a legal aid lawyer to help me with my filings (when I contacted everyone listed for civil on the the civil Legal Aid list and nobody would file the paperwork to help me with any of the cases).  Apparently our Legal Aid system is working.  Who is it working for?  It is working for who?  We do not appear to have a functioning judiciary (tertiary education system, health system).  Where does all the money go?  Apparently they would rather pay 'recruitment officers' and 'marketers' to make it look like we are wanting to hire other things and just continually re-advertise and re-market positions with no actual intention of filling them with paid workers, at all.  This is not a developed nation.  It is too corrupt.
                            </p> 

                            <p>
                            It seems to me that the Australian Constition explicitly states that New Zealand is regarded, by them, to be a State of the Federation of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  Australia refuses to honor it's own Constitution.  New Zealand seems to function as a detention camp of Australia only.  That is how the NZ Government chooses to keep the people of New Zealand.
                            </p>

                            <p>Here are  <a href="judicial-review/sup-court-waikato.pdf" target="_self"> My Filings </a>to the Supreme Court regarding the University of Waikato

                            <p>Una Jagose doesn't seem to have the job of instructing Crown Law to prosecute corruption within New Zealand Universities, or within the Judiciary (where judges refuse to accept evidence and where the supreme court punishes people for bringing injustices before the courts).  It seems there is no evidence that they will accept that would attest to corruption.  None of the invoicing information that I provided (e.g., 0.5 EFTS = 120 points = 60 points = indefinate enrolment).  They appear to have complete freedom to do anything they want with impunity.  Our Universities are nothing other than slave or detention camps designed to waste time only by delaying people until they die.  This is not the developed world.  <p> <a href="judicial-review/crown-law.pdf" target="_self"> Blow off response. </a>

Here's how it goes.  I file against the ADHB.  They order a case management conference.  They say I need to revise and resubmit my filings.  I say I can't do that without them handing over my case file notes because this is the evidence that there is.  I don't know what dates I was detained until I see what they say in my notes.  I don't know if I was unlawfully drugged until I see my notes.  They say I can't go on a fishing expedition.  I say they are required to give me my file notes.  They don't like that I said 'in the name of the OIA (rather than privacy act)'  SO revise and re-submit Ms Roe.  No,  you can't have a lawyer.  No,  you can't have an amicus.  Re-file your filings Ms Roe.  Else,-- what?  I'm in contempt of court for refusing to file and re-file and re-file and re-file and slave slave slave for the courts?  I'm to 'stay' indefinately? The lack or absence of a justice system.
                             </p>

                             <p>If you argue with a fool long enough you wonder who the fool really is.  The trouble is that I didn't ask to be a citizen of here.  I don't think that a reasonable and solvent person would choose to be.  I mean, what do you say in response to the courts thinking that it is not a matter of public interest how NZ Universities choose to violate statute with respect to enrolling, progressing, completing, and progressing complaints of students.  The statute says they are supposed to enrol students in courses of the students choosing (the Univerity administration does not get to stream students into degrees they want the students to do) and yet this is what they are doing.  The statute says they are supposed to uphold the academic freedoms of students to work to internationally accepted standards of scholarship.  But they refuse to get students work out to international community so as to prevent and prohibit international community from signing the students off.  They did not get my work to externals not because they were afraid that I would be failed by international community -- but because they believed I would be passed.  They think their job is to prevent and prohibit and obstruct and confuse and delay...  They aren't functioning as universities at all, they are functioning as slave labor detention camps.  That is a matter of public interest.  They go about blackbirding for students trying to get people to pay into a system internationally (as well as domestically) that is designed to extract forced labour out of them (and additional payments from forced re-enrolments etc) and they don't do any of the things they are supposed to do when it comes to at the very very very very least getting out of the f*cking way between the student and the external examiners.  They think that they can grant or withhold degrees for whatever arbitrary reasons they want.  The 'yay' or 'boo' theory of academic merits where the council picks out the students who...  I don't know.  I don't know what reason you have to think that if you paid the bribes or the exit payments that would inspire them to do what they say they will do if you pay them off without complaint.  Then the courts say 'pay the courts pay the courts pay teh courts pay the courts pay the courts' and they won't accept your filings.  They insist on recharacterising the issue into one they pronounce failed.  That is to say the courts choose to behave no better than the universities.  This is not a developed nation.  It does not have a functioning administration.

                            <p>How long can it possibly take to get credit for 1 year of work?  That I completed in 2018?  The University Calendar Regulations provide a list of outcomes of examination (a) - (f).  The ONLY outcome of examination that did not outright contradict the reports of 2 external examiners (and the fact they refused to return the thesis to the candidate) was that I had up to 10 weeks to supply a substantively updated thesis in fulfilment of requirements for the Degree.  Since they refused to post the thesis back to the candidate (when their examiners pack said that courier return of the thesis costs would be met by the Univesrity upon request) that meant they were not requiring me to keep working for 6 additional months under conditions of re-enrolment.  I supplied a substantively updated thesis on 05 February 2019 and again on 24 February 2019 that had been changed, I believed in ways required by the examiners.  The University was required to get that thesis to the externals and ALLOW them to sign off on completion of the degree.  The University refused to do that.  Again, hoarding the thesis.  3 lots of thesis submissions just hoarded by the university administration.  I did everything I was required to do in completion of requirements for the degree and the University refused to do any of the things they were supposed to do.  They didn't enrol me properly.  They didn't get my work to externals on at least 3 separate occasions.  Just refused to do it.  They bullied me continually saying I couldn't do the qualification, they wouldn't allow it.  I said that just because I was doing a thesis *about* disability did not mean I was intellectually handicapped.  I was not asking for accommodations or extra time.  They assured me they were not treating me any differently from any other candidate.  This is how they treat their candidates.  It is not a university.  They refuse to do any of the things that are required to allow timely completion of student research.  THey aren't trying to train a workforce of medical doctors (or anything at all) they are only interested in keeping slaves.

                            <p>I thought Waikato wanted a graduate entry medical program.  I thought they would want me to do well and be connected to the Waikato.  Help them develop their program.  But the idea of the program was a front (maybe to put in a bid so more money went to Auckland and Otago than would have without a bid from Waikato).  But the idea would have been that the Waikato people wanted to collect more and more and more money from students for enrolling in Med and then it would simply put them to work acting as doctors (hey, they watch shortland street don't they?) in the Waikato hospital and various other places around the Waikato.  Instead of the students paying Auckland University to bonded-servitue in the hospitals during their studnet years (to only ever  be replaced by new 'students' and failed out of the qualification), they wanted them to be paying Waikato University.  That is to say, they weren't actually interested in having me be part of the development of medicine and medical training in the Waikato at all.  Comes back again to not actually wanting the people to live.  Not actually wanting the people to have healthcare.  Not paying qualified people to work in the health system.  Not signing off on qualification completions.  Not processing enrolments, even.  Just won't do it.  Taking all of the money and not doing any of the things that they are supposed to do.  Wanting to collect up more and more and more money for the administration, is all.  Wanting the administration to have more and more power over more and more bonded servants or slaves.  There's nothing there.  It's so very very very very sad.
