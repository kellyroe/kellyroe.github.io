                                <p>Alright, so here's the story.  I am waiting on two things:  (1)  The Australian National University.  They are locating my student records and saying something about why I left the ANU without my PhD.  (2)  The social security tribunal of New Zealand.  The New Zealand government chooses to keep me on less than minimum wage.  I am not shoulder-tapped for work (as is customary) and my applications, progressions, completions from NZ universities are not progressed, either.  The courts also aren't progressing my filings.  The supreme court has ruled that I'm required to pay them more than $20,000 in 'security for costs' to have cases heard on appeal after justice was denied to me in the high court proceedings. 
                                </p>

                                <p>I am aware that they think they can get free labor / free work out of the things that I post to the internet.  So that stops.  Probably I'll end up murdered now I've worked the end of my slave-life.  What do you think?  I'll try and time-stamp daily...  So (unlike Mason Pendrous) you'll know when they decided it was time for me to go.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Monday 6 June 4:32pm
                                </p>

                            <p>
                            The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications.  They define a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a> 
                            </p>

                           <p>Australasian Universities believe they are entitled to simply refuse to process or progress students work, however.  Take it to court, they say.  Then the courts refuse to progress filings.   
                            </p>

                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.

                            </p>

                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  
                                </p> 

                            <p>
                            It seems to me that the Australian Constition explicitly states that New Zealand is regarded, by them, to be a State of the Federation of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  Australia refuses to honor it's own Constitution.
