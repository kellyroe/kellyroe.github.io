                            <article>

                                <p>
                                The work that I had done in the Philosophy of Psychopathology was all based on the assumption that the aim was to help people in ways they themselves wanted to be helped rather than engaging in a harmful process of abuse.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                So, for example, I was trying to extend work that had been done on delusions and therapy so as to develop therapy for people with delusions in a way that may be experienced, by them and their families and communities, to be helpful to the person presenting for treatment. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                But if the aim or the point or the purpose is to unlawfully detain (in conditions of torture, even), then you can see a different function for diagnosing and 'treating' of delusions.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                New Zealand has been exposed to Psychiatry.  New Zealand has the idea of it.  Such that people present to GPs or the ED, asking for help from Psychiatry, specifically.  They invisage a combination of excluding medical causes, sometimes prescribing medication, and monitoring the prescriptions in conjunction with regular psychotherapy.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                New Zealand does not appear to have Psychiatry.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                On example of this occurred to me in 2020.
                                I presented to the ED of the Auckland City Hospital seeking treatment for a physical complaint.  Previous injury has resulted in disfigured and numb toes.  I had been walking extensively during lock-down and ended up with nails coming off, bacterial infection, and I was concerned about possible hookworm infestation from walking barefoot in the Domain. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I presented to the ED rather than my GP because, at that time, the media was reporting that GPs did not have PPE and, at that point in time, the EDs were relatively empty.
                                </p>  

                                <p>
                                They mocked my concern about parasites.  They  placed an IV line in my arm and held me in a seclusion room under 'duty of care' for more than 12 hours.  There were extensive cords from medical equipment.  There was no natural light.  There was an LED that was strobing and medical equipment with regular intemittent beeps.  I was not allowed to phone the police or a lawyer.  These sorts of sensory deprivation conditions are likely to induce delusions in most people.   
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                They sectioned me for a 5 day observation hold under the Mental Health Act on grounds they believed me to be delusional.  They required me to take who knows what psychotropic medication and there is no medication that was charted for me, at all.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                After 5 days they gave me a form saying I was to be kept under the Mental Health Act with 'voluntary' status.  They refused to allow me to leave and asserted that I was choosing to stay voluntarily in the hospital.  I was not.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The problem is not that there isn't enough resources for everybody who wants help to have help.  The problem is the bullying and abuse.  Various people are being unlawfully detained in the hospitals in the name of medical 'treatment' when they don't want to be there.  Various other people are also sent away from the hospitals without medical treatment.  The idea seems to be to only treat the involuntary or some such.  I mean, what do you have to do to train a population to pay taxes without the expectation of social services?  How badly do you have to treat  people before they learn that healthcare is not for them?
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                They would rather treat me like that than enrol me in Medicine and allow me to work as a medical doctor helping people (and only people) who actually want to be helped.  They would be correct that I'm not exactly Dr Leeks 2.0 material.  I never did find Dr Leeks motivating or inspiring.  I never wanted to be like that or be like him.  I never wanted to train under people like that or like him.  That is not Psychiatry.  This is not a Health System.  They don't see the people presenting as people.  Cattle or lambs to the slaughter.  People who survive in spite of our 'health system'.  Not because of it.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The Government does not honor the scope of inquiry that has been set by the UN in the Abuse into State Care inquiry.  It was to be limited in scope specifically so as to see the Government pay the Victims for the Crimes of the Government.  What it established was that the Judiciary punishes the victims for having complained by requiring the victims to pay the courts for the Government's crimes.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The Inquiry into University of Otago Medical Students paying money in exhange for internships to be signed off as complete without them having attended was set by New Zealand and Canberra. They restricted the scope to overseas internships so as not to find corruption within NZ.  They blamed the students for paying for sign off and they did not look at how the University won't sign off on completion of their Degree if they won't pay.  Even if they do pay the University doesn't seem to sign off on completion of their Degree.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                When the Auditor General looks at Universities he does not look at what theses have been accepted by the University (and the enrolment dates) and calibrate that with what they say about the enrolment EFTS and the number of studnets that the University claims to have enrolled in the corresponding period.  The Universities are fabricating Graduate Research numbers and holding a few studnets hostage / to ransom.  Not crediting them for the work that they do.  Trying to bully them into fleeing with no credit.  Not paying out scholarships awarded else not awarding the scholarship funds to any actual recipient.
                                 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The Auditor General is now restriting the scope of inquiry with the DHB's to Children's Psychiatry, specifically.  They aren't looking at how many FTE Psychiatrists there are employed in the DHB's and who those people are.  They need to look into those people and see how many of them have been struck off overseas registers for atrocities.  How many of them haven't (yet) only because of some kind of asylum that seems to have been granted to them by the Courts of New Zealand since the Courts of New Zealand has decided, too, that they would like to abuse the people who Psychiatry has picked out to abuse, as well.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I didn't ask to  be born, here.  It is not fair that around 1/4 of our population is bullied into fleeing New Zealand (the idea is that if you have any brains at all then you will flee New Zealand if you know what is good for you).  What is fair is for the offenders to stand down.  If you aren't willing to work towards the development of New Zealand then you leave.  Get out of the way. 
                                </p>

                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The Court of Appeal has deemed Roe v University of Otago abandoned because Ms Roe failed to pay excess of $7,000 security for costs for the case to be heard on appeal.  They refused to see the matter as being of genuine merit.  They refused to dispense with or reduce security for costs.  Here are the submissions that I filed with the court of appeal:

                                </p>

                                <p>  Here are my submissions for the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court saw fit to award additional costs against me, only in response to these filings:

                                <p>I do not see how anybody can do business in this Jurisdiction.  The time will come when they demand you pay bribes or exit payments or facilitation payments or work in considerable excess of what you were contracted for.  Then, what are you going to do?  You could meet their demands.  But then, what guarantee would there be that they would honor their new terms?  Why wouldn't they just keep making more and more and more and more demands of you?  Otherwise, you can take them to Court.  But the Courts of New Zealand refuse to uphold the laws of New Zealand.  They refuse to honor obligations to international community in how they interact with people.  I don't see how, given the Courts of New Zealand, people can do business in this jurisdiction.  Where is the justice?
                                </p>

                                <p>I have an idea that I like to call 'clever'.  It goes like this.  Firstly, you offer someone a job.  You lure them with an offer of job.  Then you bully them.  Try and bully them into leaving, 'voluntarily'.  Otherwise you can get rid of them by simply not paying them.  Like how the Government wouldn't pay the teachers near the start of Labors first term.  Just wouldn't pay them.  Payroll would not do it.  Then you require them to hire employment lawyers.  Else they cannot win in the NZ courts because they are pay to play -- right?  And then the only lawyers you will acknowledge, as such, are taught to get their fee from the victims.  So the Universities (for example), as Public, Government, Universities, can get away with not paying the workers.   Not paying the workers.  Not paying the workers.  And then the courts blame the victims of the crime.  Gaslighting.  Making it all be personal against the person.  They are lazy.  They are not competent.  Etc.  Would you like to take up an employment 'opportunity' in New Zealand?
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Why don't the lawyers sue the firms?  The lawyers who are forced to slave in the firms, I mean.  Forced to work more hours than they do.  Either they aren't capable of independently filing else they know that there will be no justice in the Courts of New Zealand.  Would you like to do business with New Zealand?  
                                </p>
