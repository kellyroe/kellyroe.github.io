                                <p>Two Maaori nurses employed in management roles at Startship, was that?  Is that 0.2 FTE's (between them) in order for them not to actually nurse patients, or something else?  What is their role?  Is it to stand before the judge and say 'In my professional opinion as a nurse and a Maaori I think that the infants should be removed early and given to the state and the parents imprisoned, if need be, so that the state can do anything anythign anything to the infants with impunity'.  Is that how and why they get to be on payroll?  Evidence to the contrary?</p>

                                <p>Russian Hackers, yeah right.  Because Jacinda has been war-mongering.  Wanting a draft.  Wanting to tie people up to crosses on enemy terrain.  Erecting monuments to Baxter (see see see what the government will do to you if you don't take one for the team of five million and do anything anything anything the government says when they say because they say).  What they would do to Tamaki, right?  Because he's such a threat to the government that he needs to be locked up in Mt Eden.  Priorities.  All the government mercenaries around Parliament.  No legal consequence to the Government for unlawful lockdown.  Declaring war on the people.  So the Government wants more money, now, for keeping coronal and inquest reports secret.  Let's see..  How much money South African Orthopedic Surgeons might pay to keep quiet reports of...  His kids were murdered by his wife, were they?  They weren't sold into porn or whatever?  Are we sure about that?  Mason Pendrous.  How much money various people associated with Canterbury University and perhaps even 'Justice Toogood' (not appointed via proper process therefore not a Justice of the Court) would pay to have that secret.  Who killed him?  Come on.  Who killed him...  Various other people.  Olivia.  Where they drugging her?  State care.  Cycling NZ.  Why would she voluntarily kill herself when people were just starting to listen to her that there were serious problems within the state care organisation?  That doesn't really make any sense does it?  Corruption...  Corruption...  Corruption...  Won't even process an applciation to enroll.  Won't keep accurate student records.  Wno't graduate.  Won't publically advertise jobs.  Wno't employ the most qualified for teh position.  Corruption.  Corruption.  Corruption. </p>

                                <p>What are we supposed to think?  That Harvard wouldn't acknowledge any alleged Prime Minister of New Zealand who didn't run New Zealand as a slave camp prison camp detention camp?  That Biden wouldn't meet with anyone?  etc.  The Australasian role is to keep a penal colony of people it would be costly to imprison in the Northern Hemisphere.  Right?  They can 'invest' in New Zealand and do a little anything anything anything down here for a while.  The entire country being a prison camp, I mean to say.  Corruption.  Corruption.  Corruption.  Will not develop.</p>


                                <p>I have a letter from the University of Waikato in House Counsel (Shelly Slade-Gully, award winning, apparently) saying that they intended to hold me (a graduate student) under the 'zero fees scheme' indefinately. Of course, I am not eligible for the zero fees scheme since the zero fees scheme is for studnets who are studying for the first time at University level (students in their first year of University level study).   I just say this to point out that the University of Waikato, at least, is not willing or able to apply the zero fees scheme appropriately.  That means or is to say that they are falsely reporting student numbers to the Government.  Whether the Government knows (has audited their books properly or not) is, of course, a different matter.  But their enrolment numbers do  not add up, at all.  I don't know what Shelly Slade-Gully's problem is that she thinks it is appropriate to be sending extortion letters etc to students.  I don't suppose she would be on payroll (or be regarded as an award-winning lawyer by the University) if she didn't send them.  Just so you know what kind of people you'd be dealing with. </p>

                                <p>The University of Otago has said that they have chosen to use the 'Alternative' or 'Other' category or criterion to intentionally choose to enrol Australian Citizens (who have no ties to New Zealand at all) also intentionally choose to enrol studnets in MBChB who have never studied at Tertiary (either university or polytechnic) level at all.  They say that they have the unlimited power to choose whoever they want to enrol in that programme for whatever arbitrary reasons they want.  They are entitled!  What reasons do they have for selecting students into Medicine?  They want to keep up the Glue Factory and keep up the sort or kind of work that Dr Leeks was doing. That appears to be their interest.  They are not at all being fair in the way they are selecting applicants.  It is not academic merit based, at all.  They tell students they were not selected because they lack academic merit but then they refuse to calculate GPA when it doesn't confirm the selection decisions they have already made.  They are not being fair in selection at all.  It is unclear to me that they are actually graduating anybody at all from the MBChB.  I mean to say I suppose that they don't actually acknowledge that they have any graduates from that Degree.  It's a scummy hoax of a scam.  Designed to have our 'hospitals' 'staffed' with compliant studnets who keep their mouths closed in the hope that someday they might be on payroll in exchange for committing atrocities / someday they might be on payroll in exchange for promising not to testify against, or similar.  There's really nobody home.  Nothing there.</p>

                                <p>They need to look at the unique identifiers and see for how many years they are recording one particular student being enrolled.  I mean to say, that I think the way that Waikato has achieved doubling or tripling the size of their research school is to double or triple bill their research students.  Another way you could check this is by looking at the enrolment dates that the Univesrity has chosen to associate with 1 EFT 1 year 120 point Masters programmes; 2 EFT 2 year 240 point Masters programmes; 3 EFT 3 year 360 point Doctoral programmes; and, of course, 4 year 480 point Doctoral programmes (where they take 1 yaer to externally examine a thesis after the studnet worked on 100,000 words over 3 years).  I think you will find that they are forcing students to take at least 2x if not more the enrolment time that was approved by the Tertiary Education Commission.  Pretty much always.  As a matter of course.  And if the student speaks up about the unlawfulness of this practice then they withhold the qualification and get the studnet filing and refiling and refiling and refiling and refiling with the courts.  Since the Government refuses to prosecute the University for keeping false records etc etc it seems to me that the most likely explanation for this is that they know the Universities are doing this and they don't want it to stop.  Though, of course, there is the issue of there probably not being any lawyers whose qualifications and registrations they will acknowledge.  I suppose there is that.  They seem to think nothing of hiring Queens Counsels and Major Firms to defend themselves.  Reappointing retired lawyers to deny half the laws and ignore evidence that was supplied.   </p>

                                <p>Law and Medicine and everything really is just a tool for the Government to oppress the people. It seems.  That is how the Government chooses to use those things.  As tools of oppression against the people.  THey aren't providing applciations, they aren't processing them.  They position people like Dr Leeks and they close ranks about people such as these enabling them to commit further and further crimes.  They don't see anything wrong with the sorts of things Dr Leeks did.  They do everything they can to delay and deny justice to the victims.  They won't take any steps at all to actually clean up the Medical Profession and make it something that actually could  be respectable.  So as to bully good peple away so that there is no alternative to the likes of Dr Leeks.  Only game in town.</p>

                                <p>So I Just read a news article that claimed Ashley Bloomfield just made Professor at the University of Auckland.  I am confused, though, because my understanding was that he was a 'Doctor' in virtue of a MBChB (which is listed in the World Medical School Directory as an undergraduate level qualification) and he does not have a PhD (academic or research 'doctor'), or an MD (medical doctorate).  That is to say he is not an academic research and / or clinical research doctor, at all.  </p>

                                <p>They must have meant to have said that he chose to give up his three quarters of a million dollar salary per year in order to study for his PhD or MD because he *wanted* or *aspired* to be made Professor one day.  That's the only sense I can make of it.  I mean, consider his CV for the position: He doesn't have a PhD.  He doesn't have teaching or tutoring or grading experience.  He doesn't have publications.  Does he?  Apparently he has a Masters Level Qualification.  I don't know if it was a coursework Masters or a Research Masters.  If it was a 120 point Research Masters Degree completed over at least 2 academic years (and one summer school period) or something else...  I don't know how many weeks of enrolment the University recieved for having him enrolled...  I wonder if he will be full fee paying, or if they gave him a scholarship.  Will his sons still be living with him and his wife in their 1 bedroom University of Auckland Accommodation?</p>

                                <p>Just think how amazing it will be for him, decades from now.  When (if) he makes Professor.  He will be all, like, 'well, people didn't really understand why I would give up a three quarters of a million dollar civil servant salary in order to follow my dream..  But I made personal sacrifies to study for my PhD with the University of Auckland...  Not to full fee pay my way to Harvard, but to stay in New Zealand.  And then I worked on my doctoral thesis for years and years and years...  And I was soooooo scared that they might simply choose not to get my work out to external examiners at all because it would be so much cheaper for the government to require me to reenroll and reenroll and reenroll and reenroll rather than paying me three quarters of a million dollars per year to have an actual government paid position.  And then I got casual work within the university tutoring and grading.  Eventually I got my PhD and tenrure.  Publications.  And then associate professor.  And then, finally, the capstone of my career I was made Professor.  And all the sacrifices I made seemed worthwhile'.  All the decades that I spent laboring on a qualification that is supposed to credit (normally or standardly) as 360 points or 3 academic years of work.  I guess that's something to look forward to, eh Ashley?  A sort of reward or capstone on all the hard work you did working away on your PhD over however many years.  Decades.  The sacrifices you made living in University Accommodation and living off a graduate stipend or some form or sort of government allowance.  Are you really going to enrol with the Univeristy of Auckland because you want to make Professor, one day, Ashley?  When does your enrolment start?  Who is your supervisor?  When is your 6 monthly progress report going to be completed?  When will they supply the forms to you, do you think?  How many of them will you be allowed to do?  For how many decaded do you think they will require you to work before agreeing to get your work out for external examination?  Do you think there ever will be a paid position for you?  Do you think they will get your work out to externals any time within the next 10 years?  20?  Why would they?  Do you think you are special, Ashley, that you deserve to be treated so very much better than everyone else?</p>

                                <p>Apparently there is some lady in England who has worked as a Psychiatrist for the last 15 + years, or something.  I am not sure why they are choosing to go after her now and deny she graduated from University of Auckland with a MBChB.  I suppose they are supposed to pay her and they don't want to pay her so instead they accuse her of being a hoax or a fraud.  Anyway, Auckland is saying she doesn't have a MBChB from them.  But, of course, various people who don't work in Medicine and don't get paid to do any Medical work are acknowledged by Auckland as having MBChB's.  Ashley Bloomfield, for example.   I suppose they acknowledge his MBChB because he is not registered to practice Medicine.  Ayesha.  The guy from Hamilton.  Who we haven't heard from in a while.  Maybe he's keeping Brian Tamaki company in Mt Eden since otherwise people might vote for them both but there can be no alterative.  Shane Reti?  Agrees to work minimum hours to keep up his registration only.  No more than minimum hours.  Do they pay him to do that or...  How does that work?  His patients can literally only see him if they agree to see him only during 1 or 3 weeks of every year?</p>

                                <p>I don't see how it is possible for someone to forge their way onto the class roll.  But that's what one guy did - which meant they weren't going to pay him for the work he did for the hospital. The cadavar laboratory (every laboratory) has a class roll that lists all the studnets who are enrolled in the class so the teaching staff can check that only people who are supposed to be in the class are in fact in the class.  This is how education typically works or goes.  I think you may have a hard time convincing the NZ people that the University doesn't work from class rolls (unlike secondary and primary education who seem to manage).  It is not plausible to think that it is possible to forge your way onto the class roll.  Is it?  Maybe the University does not have any control over their records.  That could actually be the case.  They don't keep accurate records of enrolments, grades, graduations, at all.  That could actually be the case.  Not worth the paper they are not even printed on, these days.  Won't acknowledge the paper they say that each and every paper document is a hoax or a fraud.  Because there is no such thing as 'University' I suppose.  A fraud or hoax on all the people.  Likely what happened was that when it was time to pay this guy...  They would rather pretend they never heard of him.  They would rather say they don't acknowledge his qualifications anymore.  They simply refuse to pay the workers.  Nobody there.  Nothing home.</p>

                                <p>During the Labor Governments most recent first term they stopped paying the teachers in the schools.  Said that it was an Australian Payroll Systems error or problem.  THey did not acknowledge that the teachers in the schools had graduated from their teacher training qualifications.  They refused to pay them.  The last thing Harlene Hayes did on her way from Otago to her position in Western Australia was fail at least 1/3rd of the Medical class.  They said that they did not acknowledge that they had completed their internships.  They had signed forms saying that they completed their internships.  But the University said they refused to accept that.  THey were not going to graduate them.  They could go into their positions as Junior Doctors and work for the DHB's in the hospitals.  But they would not pay them to work those jobs.  THey would need to keep paying the University for continued re-enrolment in the MBChB qualification.  So then they can say that they were working as frauds or hoaxes when they took up positions as junior doctors without having graduated from MBChB.  See how it fails to work?  Likely the only 'paid' positions in the hospitals were given to studnets who they refused to acknowledge had graduated.  That way they wouldn't need to pay any of them to pass themselves off as doctors in our hospitals.</p>

                                <p>New Zealand (and Australia) do not have education and training systems. They have prison slave detention camps.  Certain people are picked out all Stanford Prison Experiiment like to be in the position of oppressor and certain other people are picked out to be the oppressed.  And there is a system of prison slave or detention camps up and down the land.  Punative insittutions of abuse.  The research output of Manus Island was likely greater than the research output of the English Department at the University of Waikato.  What is the word output of the researchers at the Univesrity of Waikato?  Is it about 5,000 words every year?  How long for the researchers to get a publication, on average?  One article ever 5 years or something else?  What is the word output of the first year students, then?  They all fall on their head between first year and tenure?  Ashley was the only game in town, was he?  Only person the government supplied an application for Professor to?  It doesnt' matter whether someone manages the schools prisons hospitals universities aged care facilities early childhood care facilieies..  They are all the same.  Right Chris Hipkins?  The pipeline of abuse. By those employed by government to be abusers. </p>

                                <p>Whatever will Ashley Bloomfield be redeployed to next?  Supreme Court Judge?  Did he ever apply to Law School?  Don't worry, the University of Auckland can just say that they found an online transcript for him recording that he has his JD.  PhD.  They found a thesis with his name on it in their e-library.  I guess he probably pays them?  Right?  IN order to do anything anything anything anything anything with impunity?  How many teenage virgins will they record as having been enrolled in Ashley Bloomfields terminal masters programme, then?  Graduation scheduled for never.</p>

                                <p>Where is my MA thesis for the University of Waikato?  It is not in the Philosophy Department Thesis Repository.  WHere did it go?  Apparently David Lumsden removed it from the thesis repository.  Why did he do that for?  Why doesn't the 'Univesrity' of Waikato want to have a research output?</p>

                                <p>I am going to talk about Carl Brusse because if I talk only about me people seem keen to make it be very personally about or against me.  Kim Sterelny boasted about keeping him enrolled for...  For  how long did the Australian National University keep him enrolled before they acknowledged him as having 'done enough' for a PhD?  I think I remember Kim Sterelny boasting about him being enrolled for 10 years.  So the Philosophy Programme invoiced the Australian Government for at least 10 years worth of full time fees for keeping Carl Bruss enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled with the University.  But why stop there?  One thing they do is they move your supervisor to a different university when it is around time for your work to be sent to externals.  Then everybody tells you how garbage and rubbish and crap you are and your topic is and so on.  It doesn't really matter how they go about bullying and abusing people keeping them enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and reendolled.  I thought that it was about standing up to the bullies.  For example, instead of waiting for your supervisor to say 'okay, get it to externals now' or 'make these changes then send it out' you just hand it in.  Despite or in spite of them.  Not at all because of them.  But when I posted my thesis via track and trace to the University they said that they didn't acknowledge it because I needed to submit it in person (why think that).  They said I addressed it to thte wrong person (I did not).  They simply refused to accept it.  It is beyond bullying and having people on and misleading them and so on. It's outright corruption.  They will not get theses to external examiners specifically because they want to collect up more and more and more money for having the student enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled.  They will not pay the workers.  Entire generations of people are expected to give up any salary at all so that people like Ashley can have all the FTES they believe they are entitled to.</p>

                                <p>New Zealand constantly cries about how we don't have enough skilled workers.  But we are refusing to graduate students who have met the requirements of qualifications because we don't want to pay anybody to work skilled jobs.  We intentionally remove curriculum contents and don't grade work properly in order to cry cry cry about how we can't graduate any of them because they weren't taught anything that we value in the Degrees.  Ashley Bloomfield does not have any acdaemic publications but they say he is Professor now.  What qualifies him for that?  It is a slave hostage prison detention camp.  It cannot claim to be a University at all.  They will not get studnets work out to external examiners.  They will not allow them to sign the students off.  THey will not graduate people who have met requirements for qualifications.  They will not hire only the people who have met requirements for the qualifications.  I suppose they collect up more and more and more money for people applying and reapplying and reapplying for visas and so on.  But very very bad people live here.  THey are not conducting themselves with any honesty or integrity at all.  They are not supplying applications to enrol, they are not handling applications to enrol properly.  They throw away some applications in order to preferentially enrol the teenager children of the administration, for example.  They are not acknowledging progression through the curriculum.  They won't employ people qualified to teach the curriculum.  They often don't really have curriculum contents.  They aren't fairly grading or examining or tracking academic progress.  They aren't really an academic institution.  They aren't graduating.  They expect studnets to hand over more and more and more money, they collect up more and more and more money from the government for keeping the student enrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled.  Prison slave detention camp.  There is nothing here.  No doctors.  No lawyers.  No engineers.  No professors.  No judges.  No skilled laborers or workers.  Slaves.  Hostages.  The government appears to be fundamentally corrupt.  Corrupt through and through.  There's nothing here.  Nobody home.</p>

                                <p>Take a look at the theses that are lodged in the Univeristy every year.  They don't contain enrolment dates.  We don't know how many decades the author was required to be enrolled or how much extra money they were required to hand over to the univesristy.  We don't even know if they have a trophy room where they simply take the work of some students and reattribute authorship to others once they have bullied some of them to abandon the qualification.  There is not an education and training system in this part of the world.  It's where the northern hemisphere sends the people they can't be bothered prosecuting.  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camp.  They don't do any of the things they would be required to do in order to allow one.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>There was a Law Professor at Otago who liked to go to Law Camp for the 19 year old students who had been accepted into second year law.  It was renowned for drunken nudity etc.  I suppose it was part of the grooming process for the students so they would know what to expect on their internships.  And I suppose that is grooming, in turn, so they will know what to expect when they are given clerkship positions to write judgments, or do whatever it is that they are required to do in order to be acknowledged as having finished Law School and Registered with the Law Soceity etc etc.  Once it became publically known his role in encouraging the antics he was promoted and moved to take up a Professorship at Auckland.  Most highly valued esteemed member of the Law 'Profession'.  Harlene was promoted to Western Australia after failing at least 1/3rd the Medical Cohort in Otago.  That was her reward for refusing to sign off on their qualificiation completion.  I suppose she saved the NZ Government more than 1 millino dollars collecting up more enrolment fees from the students and not needing to pay people to pretend to be junior doctors in the hospitals (they are not acknowledged as having completed their qualifications therefore they are frauds or imposters in the hospitals.  The hospitals choose to 'employ' them because it won't pay them and the hospitals only choose to 'employ' them because it knows they are frauds and therefore it won't pay them.  They withheld acknowledging the teachers had completed their teacher training.  Said they were unpaid volunteers in the schools.  Volunteer firemen.  Volunteers for St Johns.  No education and training system.  Fraud.  Hoax.  Scummity scummity scam up and down the land.  No education and training system.  Series of detention camps for the purposes of abuse.  The government only??  Makes money off the proceeds of crime?  It has no money to pay workers?  How many slaves is Ashley going to keep at Auckland?  He doesn't even have a PhD.  Or does he now?  Where is the PhD you are going to say he outputted?  Where are the external examiners reports of it?  What a f*cking scummy scam.</p>

                                <p>So the people understand why we don't have doctors, lawyers, teachers, any skilled workers at all.  Because of the illigitimacy of the NZ government.  Proceeds of crime.  It is in the Australian Constitution that NZ is a state.  No vote altered that.  So it's still a state of Australia.  Australia chooses to arrange for NZ dollars to be printed in Canada to disguise further still how they will not pay workers.  They won't acknowledge qualifications.  They won't get work to externals etc.  I don't know why they want to pay Kim Sterelny so much money to keep slaves detained.  Why that's a strategy they wanted to see take over Canberra, now.  Australia's premire research institution .I imagine Manus Island outputs more research than the ANU.  There's nobody home.  Nothing there.</p>

                                <p>That's how our leaders choose to lead.  Apparently if htey didn't then they wouldn't be in the position they are in.  No f*cking kidding.  Corruption through and through.  A 'hospital' overtaken by security preventing and prohibiting the 'patients' from leaving is not a hospital.  It's something different entirely...  WHere are the informed consent forms?  There's really nothing here.  </p>

                                <p>The Education and Training Act states that domestic adults are eligible to be enrolled in programmes they apply to.  Otago and Auckland refuse to accept this, however.  They refuse to supply me with application to MBChB saying I am 'ineligible' because they think that they can decide who is and is not for whatever arbitrary reasons they want.  They say they refuse to accept qualifications from NZ Universities that are more than 5 years old.  I did not know that that was the value of a NZ qualification when I took up more than 100,000 of studnet debt.  They aren't keep education or universities at all.  They refuse to acknowleldge my GPA because they think that they can assign grades however they like for whatever arbitrary reasons they like.  They can simply refuse to supply transcripts, now.  Or they can simply record that a student was 'failed'.  They refuse to enrol me in programmes I apply to.  They record my being enrolled by them in courses I never applied to.  Waikato records me as being enrolled in coursese that aren't even listed in their calendar.  They are making up enrolment dates that don't correspond to any course offerings.  The Tertiary Education Commission says that 120 points = 34 weeks of work and that qualifications and courses and EFTS values are decided by them and the Universities must comply to get funding.  But the Universities are not complying and they are getting more and more and more funding from the governmetn who is refusing to pay qualified workers.  The government is paying the university to keep hostages or slaves and they put them to work in the name of their 'training programme' while the studnets pay the university.  The University won't acnowledge completion of their training.  The University gets them working the job in exhange for recording debt against the studnets name only.  They have not paid me post-doctoral fellowship levels of funding for all the reesearch they record me needing to pay for enrolment in masters or phd programmes..  More than decades...  They are keeping hostages or slaves.  There's nothing here.  There is nobody home.  </p>

                                <p>When it was time to pay Janet Frame to teach in the schools or maybe even give her a paid position as a writer in residence they chose to keep her in a psychiatric institution so she could document their crimes which made them feel powerful and all big about themselvs one can only suppose.  There will not be any psychiatry in NZ.  They won't pay psychologists, even.  THey put the interns to work and in return for the studnets paying teh university they let them play doctors or nurses or psychologist or whatever.  When it is time for the university to graduate them adn the government to pay them they won't graduate them.  They get them paying more and more enrolment and working teh job.  So then they can denounce them as frauds and hoaxes and put them into oprison, I suppose.  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>They don't want good employees to work in the hospitals.  They want students to feel forced to work in the hospitals so they will walk away when it is time to pay them.  They want the likes of Dr Leeks to be in the hospitals.  Did they pay Dr Leeks?  Or did they not pay Dr Leeks but Dr Leeks made his money pimping the children out?  They want the likes of Dr Leeks to have fairly free reign in the hospitals.  The Medical response to the Cartwright Inquiry is that 'it isn't anything any worse or very different from what every other Medical Doctor is doing in NZ'.  They say that is the case, they want that to keep on being the case.  They therefore have to bully everyone else into stepping aside and going away so that they can continue on with their crimes.  The Psychiatry Profession chose to close ranks about or around Dr Leeks.  Protecting him.  Promotiing him into a position in Melbourne.  Completely and utterly undermining any kind or sort of integrity.  If you think that anyone is responsible for undermining the Profession by showing it to be complete and utter garbage then you don't need to look much of any further than the people within Psychiatry who chose to go in to  bat for Dr Leeks at the expense of his victims.</p>

                                <p>There isn't anything here.  </p>

                                <p>They say I'm slow  because I took more than 3 Calendar years to complete my 3 year undergraduate degree.  But I studied 9 papers in my first year (4 per semester and 1 summer school).  I then had a couple years out due to death in the family etc.  Then I did 1 year part time (2 courses per semester and summer school) and then I did 9 papers (4 per semester and summer school) and that was enough for me to have completed the requirements of the 3 year undergraduate degree.  So I completed it in 2 full time years and 1 part time year because I only needed to study part time during one of those years because of how I chose to distribute my workload.  But they won't accept this.  Apparently their f*cking inability to understand means I'm stupid.  I then did Honors same as everyone else over the course of 1 academic year.  I was told (whether this is true or not I was told) that my work was bundled with the University of AUckland Honors students and sent with their students to be graded at Otago.  That was because I was the only Honors studnet in the Philosophy Programme at Waikato so it would be hard for them to say whether I was better or worse or much the same as other candidates with respect to the quality of my academic work.  I was told that my Honors grades were the result of this external examination process.  But now the University of AUckland won't acknowledge my grades because..  Well, because they don't choose me.  And that's how grades work.  They decide which children of the administration they want and then they give them whatever grades they need to give them so that they can tell everybody else that they weren't of the academic merits as their chosen candidates.  But they aren't fairly examining students and they aren't allocating grades on teh basis of independent examination and they really aren't being fair in any mode manner or way, at all. </p>

                                <p>Of course it's pretty obvious with their recent decision to make Ashley Professor when he doesn't have a PhD or any publications or research output.  I mean to say..  For how many years will he pass himself off as professor before there will be some kind of court case about him passing himself off as sometihng he wasn't, being a fraud or a hoax, claiming to be qualified for something he never even applied to..  So they can say he was imprisoned and of course went missing or died in state care.  Yeah, right.  What a f*cking farce of a hoax of a scummy scummy scam.  Who was the student who got the 2 year Harvard Masters in Leadership?  WHen did they graduate?  For how many years were they kept enrolled?  Did they need to make a cash payment for the over-time fees they were required to pay in order for them to be graduated in a timely fashion?  But will Harvard even acknowledge them at all when a prospective employer asks Harvard whether it has even heard of them, at all?  Did Jacinda choose what studnet went?  Or were all the applicants declared 'ineligible' so Jacinda kept the money?  Did Harvard Graduate a NZ studnet from the progarmme 2 years later, or not?  In NZ, what evidence is there that any of the scholarships they say are available..  Are actually paid out to studnets?  They stopped posting lists of what students were recipeients of scholarships quite some time ago.  I don't think there is any reason to believe that the money is actually going to the students anymore.  The students are still being supported by their parents.  Right?  Ashley is still supporting his teenager sons with his salary, I would suppose.  While he studies for his 3 or 4 EFT PhD over the next decade or two.  Right?</p>

                                <p>Here is a plan.  Take something like a library.  A repository for books.  A place where people to to read and study books.  Then complain that it isn't noisy enough.  Not enough people use it.  Because not enough people use it it will either have to be closed down or it will need to become something else, entirely.  It will have to become something noisy, particularly, and very open plan, so that they can find who might be trying to read and study and make sure they stop that immediately.  The idea being that we don't want people reading or writing because then they might document the crimes of the government etc.  And everybody knows that Chris Hipkins is the only game in town.  The only applicant whose literacy they would acknowledge.  Etc.  The public institutions have all been gutted.  Up and down the land.  Where are the public resources?  They fill the shelves with not very high quality stuff that is largely the donations of estate, I think.  Of course the high-value items were removed and sold off years ago.  That's why the University of Auckland has storage and desk reserve.  So items can be removed from the shelves and finally removed from the online records, even.  That's partly why people donate things like valuable books, I suppose.  So they can serve as a measure of corruption.  Try and visit the books later etc.  And, of course, to ensure that people don't go from the hospital to the library and learn more than the people on payroll to tell the judge what the courts should order in the name of 'you don't have the right to be healthy -- but the Government and Judiciary has the right to force you to comply with whatever 'medical treatment' unspecified graduate of unspecified university says is the only game in town for you'. </p>

                                <p>Only 'treat' the involuntary.  Non-voluntary.  Non-consenting.  You have been volunteered.  What part of your volunterism is difficult to understand?  Do they pay you?  No?  You have been volunteered.  That's what voluntary meeeeeeeeans.  Anybdoy who doesn't understand what voluntary meeeeeeans lacks basic literacy.  Right Chris Hipkins?  Their protest doesn't meeeeeeean anything because their consent was implicit.  That's what consent meeeeeeans.  They have been consented for the volunteer programme.  Thanking you for your compliance.  This is what freedom meeeeeeans.  The freedom to comply with what the government decided was voluntariliy right for you.  The only option that you could have consented to.  Of course!  That's what brand of 'love' they teach in the schools.  Right?  The only schools the government will voluntarily choose to put volunteers in all consenting-like.  No doubt.</p>

                                <p>'Convention Centres', of course.  Just another 'it's only temporary' accommodation where a great number of people are to be housed together so that 'all eyes on me all eyes on me all eyes on me' propaganda campaign can be rolled out.  What's that -- nobody is voluntarily choosing to sign up for your 'convention' or 'education programme' or 'conference'?  I wonder why...  No matter.  Just divert the planes etc into the region and they can stay all voluntary-like since they have been volunteered.  All freely of their own choosing.  They wouldn't have things any other way.</p>

                                <p>https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/politics/revealed-government-forced-to-spend-millions-of-dollars-on-empty-ministry-building/  Forced to write the money off, do you mean?  Who is their landlord?  The Ministry of Health?  People are still working in the building.  The lights being on and cleaners going through and so on and so forth.  So, who isn't working in the building, then?  The Policy Analysts and Advisors and so on?  How many FTE's of people are missing?  Allegedly or apparently working from home.  Yeah, right.  I guess some people in the Ministry are very very busy doing all their stats.  Not enough chidren (to pay the teachers) not enough teachers (to employ enough teachers) not enough classrooms(to put the students and teachers).  Too many students (to fit in the buildings).  Too many teachers (to pay them).  Too many not enough too many not enough too many not enough.  Too many can read for all who can read to have jobs involving readings too many can't read to have jobs involving reading.  All fo the jobs for Chris Hipkins only person who can read and his MOter who gets all the government contracts.  Wasn't it?  Doesn't she work for the Ministry?  Didn't Chris?  Who would voluntarily go from being permanent Ministry Employee to being 'elected representative'?  That doesn't make very much sense...  There aren't enough people in NZ so people are forced to nepotism but there are too many people in NZ for anything based on merit...  Not enough people want to read for reading to be valued.  Unless we can force everyone to read nobody is allowed to.  Squark squarrk waooooo!  THe kids won't voluntarily go to school until or unless we take the curriculum out.  School is where you go to eat your lunch.  Go to mornign and afternoon tea.  Especially the graduate school.  Only reason to go to school.  So you can say 'here I am.  Can you hear me bang bang banging away on the keyboard keys?'  So you can ask everybody what they are working on and take credit for it quickly quickly quickly...  Sloowwwww doooooooown Keeeeeelly.  Don't worry  about her.  She'll be alright.  The other kids will catch up.  What Education system -- right Chris?  Just roll out the prison camp programme more widely.  Let's be clear.  When does the barring the doors and setting the church on fire activity get underway?  I mean..  The Auckland convention centre was set on fire 2x -- right?  Because the engineer designed the blowtorch so as to be set down by an apprentice so a fire could start (so the apprentice would never obtain paid employment for welding).  When are you going to roll out the practice with the actual people inside?  Who wants to go to 'convention' in New Zealand?  All voluntary-like?  To, uh, listen to Professor Ashley Bloomfield talk about his terminal masters degree programme.  Yeah.  Right.   </p>

                                <p>Hey, I know.  Let's have a 'writing camp' for everyone who needs to write up their graduate research project.  Let's not let people work for more than 20 minutes at a time.  We can set the tables up to be all group-work so they can play footie under the table with each other and we can have people on payroll to walk by and insist on eye contact every few minutes.  That's how to get theses done!  Everything that was learned as an undergrad about doing your 1,500 and 2,500 and 3,000 essays and handing them in to the place they need to go by the deadline.  Let's forget that any of that happened, at all, and tell our studnets how garbage garbage late late never never they must hand in their work.  Can't even find where to hand in there work.  Can't even find when to hand in their work.  What work?  They can't read they can't write.  Never would have enrolled them with that university if they had never applied.  Let's have a writing camp!  Who wants to sign up for the voluntary writing camp in New Zealand!!!  What's that, Chris Whelan, studnet's come here (all voluntary-like) for the 'New Zealand experience' do they?  Well, I guess you would know all about that..  Blackbirding for 14 year old girls from Vietnam to enrol in AUT...  I guess that's why they say they pay you quarter of a million dollars per year to throw any complaints of wrong-doing away.  That's why they pull 'judges' out of retirement to say that it would be unlawful for you to perform your statutory function because your statutory function is what the law expressly prohibits you from doing.  That's what statutory functions are they specify your job description with an implicit 'not' in front of it.  Wow.  No corruption in New Zealand.  I guess...  If you wanted to go someplace in the world and commit atrocities with no repercussions that's  basically the 'New Zealand experience'.  Right?  Is that how you earn your keep Chris Whelan?  Or do you pay and pay and pay and pay and pay to play blackbirding for children to lure to one of the nations in the world with the highest rates of child abuse?  </p>
