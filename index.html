 <h2>Hello World!</h2>

                                <p>When I get some time I will try and make light and dark themes.  I prefer dark with low-contrast, but I understand it is not to everyone's tastes.</p>

                                <p> I started the Judicial Review tab to help me keep track of where things were up to for the various court cases.  It was helpful to to organise things in this way.  Things grew unexpectedly when it came to documenting why there are so many versions of my theses.  Much of it doesn't need to be posted publically, and I am working to transitioning  bundle-type documents off the publically viewable webpages.</p>

                                <p>I am also thinking about how to update some of my past work so it is a bit more polished and contained.  Part of it is about my figuring out whether to use LaTeX and PDF links or whether to try and make a html template that looks like LaTeX.  Maybe there is little point to that since people can simply open the PDF documents within their browser window.</p>
           
                                <p>You can contact me via the email address: email@kellyroe.org.
                                Yes, you probably read that correctly, 
                                my email address starts with the word "email".
                                I'll let you copy-paste that into whatever email programme you like.
