                             </p>

                             <p>https://www.newsroom.co.nz/news/people-treated-under-compulsory-care-laws-hits-record-high  They are emboldened by the stalling of progress on the abuse in state care inquiry.  There are no negative consequences for abusing people in state care.  Sign up more and more and more and more and more people for state care.  There will be no consequences or ramifications for abusing people in state care.  We can just say 'sorry' and keep on at it.  Signing up more and more and more people to be abused, at the hands of the state.  Who will stop us?  You and whose army?  Dr Leeks was intentionally re-deployed to Melbourne to facilitate and enable him to continue with his ongoing crimes.  Face up to realities.  Also: It's not like he was doing anything very much worse than what various other people are doing.  Right?  We just need to accept that, people. You lose.  You have been signed up to be abused by the government.  More and more and more and more and more of them.  What does NZ have?  Highest rates of abuse and 'suicide' and so on, in the world?  Isn't that the goal purpose point aim or function?  Are they bad at being good..  How incompetent could they possibly be?  Maybe they are just really really good at being bad.  Maybe that's it.  I guess it's about the attitude.  Do they think they are doing a good job of all the involuntary non-voluntary compulsory 'treatment' orders...  Or do they think they aren't doing such a good job of it.  Only treat ('treat') the involuntary non-voluntary non-consenting.  They have been consented.  What is so hard to understand?  What health system?  Can't even / won't even process applications to enrol etc.  There is no alternative.  Nobody else need apply.  Ffs.  Not even trying, hey.  </p>

                             <p>D&D RECONCIEVED.  AKA:  WHAT WOULD JESUS DO??</p>

                             <p>NOTE:  Maybe I leave typos in my work such that people can feel useful suggesting changes that would in fact unquestionably make the work better -- while keeping their hands off of my content.</p>

                             <p>'Oh ho ho ho ho she thinks she's better than us, she doesn't care what we think (that's a good reason to all get together than throw rocks at her)'.  No, that's not quite it.  The issue is that I can be responsible for my content -- and you can be responsible for yours.  You can have a a response to my work that is your own to have.  That doesn't mean that my work needs to be changed to incorportate you in it.</p>

                             <p>It is strange to me that the NZ external examiner of my work...  Wrote that she'd be embarrassed to be associated with my work.  That she'd be embarrassed for anybody to know that she had passed it.  See...  To my mind...  I would be more embarrassed about being associated with having said...  Precisely that.  I'd be embarrassed (if I was her) for having authored an external examiners report of a 1 year Masters Thesis that said such things in respones to the one that was sent to her.  I mean...  She doesn't have author control over what I say in my thesis.  She isn't the author of my thesis.  Her examiners report, on the other hand.  That was of her own making.  What she chose to say in that, there.</p>

                             <p>She's embarrassed for me?  Well, I'm embarrassed for her.  No, I'm not.  I'm surprised at how unprofessional she was.  Her lack of professionalism.  That she would say that to a student.  Does she write that kind of thing as comments on her students work?  That she is embarrassed for what the students have said?  That she is going to be failing them out of the University because she is embarrassed to be associated with them?  Is this considered appropriate conduct?  When it happens to anybody else, or just when it happens to me?  What the hell.  I mean, seriously.  </p>

                             <p>It also stands in quite start relief compared to the external examiners report of the examiner who was based outside Australasia.  His whole attitude seems to be surprise that the thing is dragging on so long.  It isn't supposed to be that hard to do a 1 year Masters in 1 year ffs.  It's really not supposed to be that hard.  </p>

                             <p>NZ has this really strange thing where it is really very cruel and undermining to it's own people a lot of the time.  Waikato more in particular.  Particularly.  I could name quite a few people who were bullied into fleeing, basically.  The University deciding over and over and over and over again to recruit from overseas or from somewhere distant in NZ rather than recruiting someone local.  They like to keep the locals in their place.  Not give them employment etc.  Fail them if they can.  It defies comprehension just how hard the 'University' works to not have a research output.  To  not allow or acknowledge the research output of the students etc.  It really defies credibility.  If they aren't primarily focussed on research (as the education and training act says they must be) what is the point of them?  Slave trading?</p>

                             <p>---</p>

                             <p>Okay...  So this is a mock article-y thing.  Thingamie bob.  Whatsit.  There is this idea or a meme or whatever or whathave you of What Would Jesus Do?  Now, I bring to you, a riff, or variant on the theme.  And my riff, or variant, goes like this: What Would Dr Leeks Do?</p>

                             <p>What is the point of this?  Well..  I guess the idea is that one imagines Jesus for the 'good' or the 'kind' or the 'benevolent' or the 'psychologically mature' option.  *Good vibes*.  You get the idea.  </p>

                             <p>And I want to contrast with that...  Something else.  And there are various things I could have picked or chosen...  One of them (traditionally) would have been Satan.  But, then, I ask you to think of what hell Satan represented...  And I ask you to invisage that, as well as you can, as being something that exists upon earth.  And, well, many people have heard something of the things that Dr Leeks did or allowed to be done or arranged to have done and so on and so forth..  To children.  And I ask of you, as best you can, to empathise.  You know, show your supreme and superior emotional intelligence or power of rationality or whatever it is that allows you to project yourself into the place of the children... And to, then, consider, from their point of view...</p>

                             <p>And so now I have described to you.  The idea.  The ideology.  Of What Dr Leeks Would Do.</p>

                             <p>So we are fairly clear and all on the same page.  Now that is done and we can move on to the next step of the 'game' or 'situation' or what have you.</p>

                             <p>PART TWO:</p>

                             <p>Now I ask..  Now I ask of you..  What is it.. What is it that Dr Leeks would do...  With the game of D&D?</p>

                             <p>I put that to you.</p>

                             <p>What is it that Dr Leeks would do?</p>

                             <p>ANSWER:  FIRST PASS</p>

                             <p>Firstly, we are going to have to sexualise this game.  Voluntarily.  That is what the children want.  To play a sexualised game.  Dr's and Nurses, if you will.  The children require it.  The game will be, can be played, no other way.  </p>

                             <p>ANSWER:  FIRST PASS</p>

                             <p>Riffing on the theme of firstly...  What the children want (in fact) -- it becomes increasingly obvious to me, in my role as Psychiatrist or Clinical Psychologist or Teacher or One with All Power Over You...  Is...  Oh my god!!! It just so happens to turn out (all voluntary-like) to be everything I have ever fantisized about!  All my hopes! All my desires!  All my dreams!  Everything I have ever fantisized about!!! I should really get government funding for helping me helping me helping me help myself to them...  I feel so much better for all the play time that I have with them.  For their own good, obviously.  Their psychopathology.  They are such attention seekers, obviously!  The problem with them (insofar as they have a problem) is that they will do anything anything anyting for the highest bidder..  And ooooh I forsee a situation where someone may outbid me!  Oh noes!  They need treatment from me, clearly, to see the error of their ways...  </p>

                             <p>ANSWER:  SECOND PASS</p>

                             <p>Well, clearly the theraputic value of D&D is having people role play whatever it is that I want or require them to be.  I can simply give them characters for them to play and they can understand that their purpose and function in life (in fantasy) is only to please me.</p>

                             <p>If I want my boys to RPG girls (otherwise they are trans-phobic)...  Etc...  Etc... I want people to role-play (this is crucial) that their one goal and desire in life is to be whatever it is that I want them to be.  Really portray that they are the actual embodiement only of my desire...</p>

                             <p>D&D</p>

                             <p>Why would the children (why would anybody) want to voluntarily play that game?</p>

                             <p>Wait..  It's voluntary?</p>

                             <p>Why?</p>

                             <p>The books are kind of cool.  Interesting...  The lore..  The rolling of dice...  The basic arithmetic.  Simple things becoming increasingly complex...  There is much to love...  But of course most adults don't actually want the kids to have free reign over or in the game.  Adults love to insert themselves into childrens games and get the children playing a RPG where the only function purpose or point of the childrens lives is to do anything anyting anyting to please or placate the adult.  The biggest bully in the playground etc...</p>

                             <p>KENKU IS..</p>

                             <p>The lore says that Kenku served a great master.  Maybe a wizard.  And the master of Kenku says (this is what he says) that he learned that Kenku (a bird race) was trying to acquire the power of speech..  Because what Kenku's imagination could conceive of...  Kenku wanted to use the power of speech...  To beg for petty baubles.</p>

                             <p>And now I ask of you...  Why on earth would anyone want the power of speech..  To beg for petty baubles?</p>

                             <p>Kenku's master would have you believe...</p>

                             <p>That Kenku's master was JUSTIFIED in cursing kenku such that he had his wings ripped off so that he could no longer fly.  In mythology..  Icarus. Also...  Kenku's master was JUSTIFIED in cursing kanku such that he no longer had the power of...  ORIGINAL THOUGHT.  Kenku cannot generate novel speech.  But that is just a by-product or off-shoot of the POWER TO GENERATE ORIGINAL THOUGHT.  Kenku was cursed such that Kenku could no longer generate original thought (because he would only beg beg beg for funding, one can only suppose) so Kenkus' master felt entitled...</p>

                             <p>So..  What is Kenku to do?</p>

                             <p>CRITICAL ROLE</p>

                             <p>D&D existed prior to critical role.  Critical role popularised D&D for both better and worse.  For better..  Things became cheaper and more accessible.  For worse...  It was a game-changer, to a certain extent.  What started as..  Comedic improv...  Turned fairly quickly into highly scripted comedic improv..  I mean to say there is only so far that player choices can actually matter when someone is going to walk out a 3d model of a combat encounter.  It's in no way improv..  Right????  But the books became availble -- free online.  I mean to say books that were only in store in plastic wrappers (never in libraries) such that YOU HAD NO WAY OF ACCESSING THE CONTENT.  Those books.  Became freely available online.  But then the content of the books..  Became...  Surperfluous?</p>

                             <p>What do the books have to do with Dr Leeks (and various proxies thereof) fantasies???</p>

                             <p>PERSONA 5</p>

                             <p>Persona 5 was a *brilliant* game in so many ways.  It really speaks to me with the Jungian Psychology.  How they turned that into a thing..  Japan.  I'm super excited to see what they can and will do for Persona 6...  But I will admit I don't have high hopes when I see what they are planning on doing with Persona 3..  In my opinion, to my mind, they are focusing on the least compelling aspects.  Rather than workign to develop and extend the best aspects.  Persona 5 gave children (RP13) and teens and even adults resources...  Psychological resources...  Virtual friends...  Lines..  To mimic as one sees fit..  Where there is resonance.  To discard when not..  Ways to approach..  Handle...  Deal with.. The evils of adults.</p>

                             <p>But the fact that Persona 5 was able to reach as wide an audience as it did (in both youth and across language boundaries or borders was)..   Most likely something that..  Dr Leeks..  And all his admirors..  All his wannabees...  Will never..  So far as they can possibly help it..  Ever..  Allow... To happen again.  So..  I find it hard to see how Persona 6 will be anything other than a weakening of the franchise.  Which saddens me.  But speaks to our times.  The fact that Persona 5 made it out there the way that it did is truely remarkable.</p>

                             <p>REQUEST:  Let Unlocked Cut Scenes be Replayable from the Trophy Room.  The STory.  Let it be a Movie.  For players who have unlocked it -- at least.</p>

                             <p>And now back to D&D</p>

                             <p>Beholders...  A lesson in the evils of adults.  </p>

                             <p>The idea is supposed to be that the base game (what is in the players guide) is the most well developed and balanced.  So that players can be both different and equals.  No body made choises (or consulted build guides such that) they are the best character or only way to play or whatever.</p>

                             <p>The classes or whatever in expansions..  And particularly the monster classes as playable races are..  Still being worked out with regards to them being balanced.  So..  What would balance them.  Make them not appreciably worse such that nobody would want to play them.  Also not appreciably overpowered such that everyone would play them.  People want to say that multi-classing is overpowered compared to not multiclassing.  Maybe.  The differnece of 5 per cent stats in a game where there are not that many rolls is in fact..  More negligible than you might suppose...</p>

                             <p>If one wanted to min-max one would pay with computers and statisticians.</p>

                             <p>All heil the mighty Dr Leeks!</p>

                             <p>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/a-place-to-call-home-new-child-health-centre-for-hastings-cbd/N3W3GHH7DFGZBMLEDYT7SCRZPY/  Aw.  All those 'disadvantaged' brown kids are just being lined up to see you in your multi-million dollar institution.  Go you!!!  Only game in town!!! Nobody else need apply and all that.  How old are you. just FYI, you know.  So that we know when to celebrate your 65th birthday (your retirement) and all that.  When it's time for you to take your 45 year + government salary. And use your copious experience and skills and training and money to..  Invest in the private sector.  Start your start up.  See what the maket thinks of that (not the government handouts for you as the primary beneficiary) and all that.  Yeah, right...  </p>

                             <p>Melville</p>

                             <p>I went to Melville Schools.  I think they have gone downhill over the years.  I remember Dr Wood.  Only just.  Batman.  He would wear his PhD academic gown to assembly.  He would play classical music.  We would grumble...  But we secretly liked it.  You could see smiles on people's faces.  The students.  Ones you wouldn't expect.  He was including people in academia.  We felt proud to be part of the school.  For the right reasons.  Momentarily, anyway.  In assembly.  I think he was fairly widely liked and respected.  That's the way I remember him, anyway.</p>

                             <p>Then we got Gary Weeds..  And things felt like they went down-hill.  He was very blokey.  Or something.  The Uniform changed, too.  It went from forest green...  Wool v necked jerseys and tartin skirts...  To cheap polyester bright red sweatshirts.  We grumbled about feeling like robyn hood...  But the new uniform was simply demoralising.  </p>

                             <p>They were talking about amalgamating the intermediate and high schools for quite some time, there.  I remember them talking about it however many years ago...</p>

                             <p>One idea was to move the form 1-5 students up to the High School and have the form 6 and 7 as a senior school on the intermediate grounds.  Or maybe it was forms 5 and 6 and 7.  When it was time to get serious.  About exams.</p>

                             <p>I remember the teachers felt like... It was going to be an excuse for them to fill up the school with primary teachers.  Basically, or effectively.  See...  They pay primary teachers less than high school teachers.  Something about primary teachers having a 3 year degree in primary teaching.  The secondary teachers were required to have a degree in their teaching subjects.  So...  English literature or history or whatever.  Actually study those subjects at uni.  Whereas the primary teachers most often did not go to uni.  They went to teacher training college.  Else the only classes they did at the amalgamation of teacher training college and university was education classes over in the education department.  Not the academic subject education department in the school of arts and social sciences..  But over with the primary teaching people...</p>

                             <p>Anyway...  The point is..  The primary teachers weren't expected to be able to teach secondary level mathmatics, say.  They were only expected to be able to teach up until the end of primary school.  But they wanted to put them in front of the form 3 and form 4..  Maybe even form 5 students.  To pay the teachers less.  Pay them primary wages instead of secondary teacher wages.  Remove secondary level curriculum from the secondary school.</p>

                             <p>Set them up well for hte University ('University') of Waikato, I suppose.  SO that they can be enrolled (even when they never applied to) in secondary level curriculum courses while having hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt recorded against their name.</p>

                             <p>That's the idea -- right?  You can pay the university thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars to be enrolled in a form 5 math class, maybe?  That's 'university'?  Is that the goal or aim?  And it can be taught by... People who pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the University to be kept enrolled in 'teacher training' qualifications.  I suppose.  They can do the job for free.  For their voluntary work experience.  Else they never will get their degree!</p>

                             <p>And of course we can say that however many are enrolled in Medicine or nursing or whatever..  And they can play doctors and nurses passing themselves off as whatever in the hospitals and the clinics.  'Aw.  I'm sorry there isn't anything anyone can do'.  Else following the computer notes telling them where the patient is to be triaged to in the patient flow.  What prescription has been assigned for the patient.  By the administation or the computer system.  Maybe the google diagnosis software?  See what they got in the randomised double blind control trial medical experimentation...  Never stop paying and paying and paying and paying the 'university' so that you can be put to play-school unpaid internship.  What University do you see?  They can't even process an application to enrol...</p>

                             <p>Nothing there, hey.  Nobody home.  Oh please tell me...  What was the research output of the Univesrity in 2018?  The entire philosophy programme..  Let's see?  Did anybody in the department do any research at all?  Nothing?  What University?  wtf...</p>

                             <p>And who is embarrassed to be associated with who?  Apparently Jacinda Arden is an "academic" now.  She never applied to do her 4th (Honours) year.  She never did any independent research (did she)?  Did she write up an independent study for 30 points?  Did she do a 120 point 1 year research thesis?  Did she write a 360 point PhD?  No?  She reads the teleprompts that are given to her to read and everybody clap clap claps at her being given an honorary (that is to say unearned) degree.  Which is (or was) traditionally, something that you give to whoever has been invited to speak at graduation.  Often an entertainer.  Someone the kids voted they wanted to hear play at graduation, because they liked their music or whatever.  So the school writes them a speech to read out to the graduating class and they play their song, or whatever.  The person invited to do that is granted an honorary degree.  Oh but now she has 3 fellowships at Harvard (after not having applied for 1) and...  Well..  The list just goes on, doesn't it...  Yeah, right.  Yeah, nah.  I don't think so.  </p>

                             <p>F*cking hoax of a scum of a scam.</p>

                             <p>So now apparently Kiri Allen's trying to get work.  She's saying about her mental health problems -- so I guess that means she's disclosing her mental health problems on her government job applications.  All the questions about if you've been accused of a crime or appeared before the courts within the last 7 years...  I don't think anybody thinks she should be left to starve.  BUT WHY IS IT THAT I"M ALWAYS EXPECTED TO SIMPLY MOVE ASIDE SO THAT OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE F*CKING WELL DONE CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN ME CAN TAKE AND TAKE AND TAKE FOR THEMSELVES?   Now, it's not that I don't try and stand up for myself or whatever whatever.  Because, I tell you what, when I do try..  Then you see their real teeth and claws come out and see the extent of what they will do.</p>

                             <p>Wah wah wah what are you going to do about it?  You and whose army?</p>

                             <p>F*cking hell, NZL.  Why do you have to be such a f*cking sh*t hole of a hell hole of a f*cking dump.  Always.  F*cking hell.  Bully bully bully bully bully.  Kim Sterelny.  He's a f*cking bully.  F*cking horrible f*cking obnoxious prick.  Appointed to the ANU just in time to deal with me.  F*cking bully for him.  Is he dead yet?  The f*cking prick.  How hard can it be to take the work -- and get it to externals.  It had one f*ckign job to do.  If you aren't going ot help get out the f*cking way.  Now he's over 65. Still on the payroll.  Allllllll of the research funding for him.  F*cking psychotic freak.  Get the f*ck out.  F*cking hell...  Any philosophy left in your philosophy curriculum?  What university?</p>
