                            <article>

                                <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/131511206/nurse-who-questioned-if-medicine-he-was-providing-to-patients-was-legally-obtained-awarded-23k  How many patients died because of what they were given in the drip?  The heads of drip IV are going to be prosecuted?  They are going to be given medals?  Allll the government external contracts for them.  How much did he have to pay his lawyers?  How much did he have to pay the court in court costs?  Drip IV was so unafraid of the court that they knew they were in the wrong and they chose to invest in lawyers for themselves rather than actually employing NZ doctors to do the scripts from now on.  And Drip IV is likely now going to drag things throught he court of appeal?  Right?  So that anything that was awarded to this guy will be taken.  It is like we take the honest people and murder them.  Wrongful death them.  Refuse to allow them wages.  And we take the violent pedophiles and murderers and sexual offenders and cheats and incompetents and give them all medals.  I wonder who the judge was.  Pulled out of retirement to ensure that the real winner, here, was drip IV.  So they can go on infusing patients with who knows what in the name of medicical treatment or care.  Experimenting on the patients and so on.  Did they have a NZ government external contract did they?  Do they still have the contract?  Pay rises all around, was it?  </p>

                                <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/131505551/surgeons-forced-to-decide-which-patients-have-the-worst-cancer-and-wont-survive-as-crisis-deepens  Good Morning!  Good Morning!  The Genralists ('trained' in Queensland -- hand picked as special, no doubt, like the VC's daughter)  The Genralists said.  (A Generalist is a person they claim to be 'medical doctor' who does their own anasthetics, general surgery, and obstetrics and gynecology.  Largely, best I can figure, because nobody else will work with them.  They send then in to Aboriginal Communities (also Christchurch) to have their funsies on the lowest valued population in the world).  Good Morning!  Good Morning!  The Generalists said, as we met 'em last week on their way to the OR.  Now the patients they greeted are most of 'em dead.  And they're cursing the staff for incompetent swine.  'He's a cherry old card' Grunted Harry to Jack.  (Soooooo preeeeety.  So charasmatic!  Sooooo confident!) As they..  Something something.  But he did for them both by his plan of attack.  Which was clearly and obviously the plan all along.  Though they claim to be soooooooo stupid that nobody saw it coming.  Are they retired yet?  There will be a job for certain other people only over the dead bodies of those grubby grabbing them at present.  I think they have made their position very very very very very very clear.</p>


                                <p>The Courts and Chris Whelan's Incapacity.  We could start by asking Chris Whelan everything he has done to uphold the quality and integrity of NZ University qualifications.  In the face of the obvous concern that they are functioning as unlawful prison, detention, slave camps.  What is he doing to ensure that they are not these things?  Anything?  Anything?  One meaningful thing?  One meaningful thing to show that graduate student research is being completed in a timely fashion.  That it isn't the case that supervisors regularly cry screaming hissy tantrum fits when it is time to get their studnets work out to externals and the university administration isn't regularly simply refusing to get the studnets work out.  Having studnets work for 1 year qualifications in excess of 2, having students work for 3 year qualifications in excess of 6.  Refusing to allow anybody (who actually wrote their own work) to complete the qualification.  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camps.  There's nothing there.  Chris Whelan has not processed a single complaint of wrongdoing since he was appointed to office in 2014.  They say that there are 'personal problems' in the studnet or between the student and the supervisor and that is why they won't get the students work out for external examination.  So many personal problems. It's not systematic or systemic, at all, it's all entirely personal, apparently.  They then go out of their way to hire pedophiles and psychopaths and people who don't actually do any f*ckign research.  Or people who take their students work, bully them into leaving without credit, put another skin on it, and then pass it off as their own.  Garbage dump of a f*ckign waste land.  By design.  You go Chris Whelan.  Explain to the people a single thing you have done to uphold the quality and integrity of NZ Universities when you haven't processed a single f*ckign complaint of wrongdoing since you have  been appointed to office.  I couldn't imagine what anybody more useless than you could possibly be like..  I'm trying to imagine a single hire or person for the position who could do a worse job of it, than you.  I really can't think of anybody who could  be more f*cking useless.  Unless you want to change places with the Ombudsman who is paid to never see anything wrong?  They replaced him with someone else at some point, right?  Then brought him back because he's great at not seeing anything wrong in the hospitals and the prisons and the schools. When he does say that he sees something wrong we should really be worried then,  becaue of everything he ommmitted.  He gave them weeks notice in advance that he was coming and did not deviate from the route they took him on.  Could you imagine a worse f*cking hire for the position?  It is incapacity, do you think, or belligerence?  There's nothing here.</p>

                                <p>What happened to Olivia Podmore (in her Special School of Elite Cycling) and what happened to Mason Pendrous (as a First Year Computer Science studnet at Canterbury) was 'entirely personal' which makes it okay?  Seriously?  Come on.  F*ckign hurry up and get with developed world..  Else get the f*ck out of the way.</p>

                                <p>I am remembering a reassurance that was given to a major firm early on (they sent a junior to an early case management conference):  Don't worry, Dear it's not going to be a Jury Trial.</p>

                                <p>I mean to say...  Judges hauled out of retirement (on payroll with nothing to lose) are likely going to make very very very different judgments from the average NZer.  In everything...  From Chris Whelan's fitness for $250,000 ++++ office and more...  I mean to say, I think that being trialed before a Jury of..  Not their peers.  Average NZers.  People hauled at random off of the electoral roll (the what, now?) is more likely to find in the interests of justice than the Judicary.  Hauled out of retirement for..  Um..  Everything it is that... Um..  Una?  Who now?  Everything it is that they value...</p>

                                <p>I just want to remind everyone that Circa contacts..  Blah blah...  It would only cost us $100,000 per year to keep him behind bars.  And then we could pay some other person to uphold the quality and integrity of NZ Universities and we would still likely have $50,000 towards the courts costs..  And that's only accounting for one year of his salary!  COME ON!!!!!</p>

                                <p>I mean.. All that and we would still be laughing to the bank about the profits we'd made.  And it would in fact be grotesquely obscene but for one small point:  The statutory function of the CE of the NZVCC is clear in statue and HE HAS NOT PROCESSED A SINGLE COMPLAINT THAT HE HAS RECIEVED SINCE HAVING BEEN APPOINTED TO THE POSTION IN 2014.  I mean..  FFS.  How f*cking stupid do you take the world to be???  I mean to say that I know people who you would call retarded and this is something else.  This is something different, entirely...</p>

                                <p>Anyway... I ask you one simple question, good members of the jury:  'how can we afford not to?'  Which is, of course, why they would never graduate me ever ever ever ever from Law School...  Or..  Anything else.  Do you see?  Who wants your euthansia drugs.  Roll up roll up.  Who has been signed up for the LD50...  Hello???</p>

                                <p>Ayesha Verral fires someone for not being politically neutral.  But the Minister for Justice and Minister for the Courts both refuse to even so much as remind the Judiciary on expectations for timely Judgment delivery.  They say they can't use political pressure or influence on the Judiciary to remind the Judiciary what it's f*ckign job is, again, since they are refusing to do it.
                                </p>

                                <p>More than 4 months post a substantive hearing on the issue of whether Justice is an Essential Need or not (DUH the courts stayed open during lockdown) the Social Security Appeals Authority still has not delivered a Judgment on the issue.  Apparently they have been off on holiday and they have been off sick.  I see.  That's why they keep me on disability and pay them exhorbitant salaries to not do the job for which they are paid.  All of the money for them, then, to refuse to do the job for which they are paid.  While they keep me on disability, then, refusing to process applications to enrol according to published selection criterion, refusing to acknowledge progression of training.  Refusing to get my work out to external examiners. Refusing to allow external examiners to sign off on completion of research.  They choose to hire Justine Kingsbury and Carolyn Mason as Philosophy Acadmics in NZ Universities.  They say I didn't do enoguh in the 2018 academic year for credit for a 120 point MPhil that I applied to be enrolled in.  University Academics primary function is supposed to be research.  Let's see their research output over the 2018 academic year so we can see who did enough for...  Well, look at the research output I did.  Compare that to their research output over teh comparable period.  Why are they on payroll?  To keep slaves?</p>

                                <p>NZ doesn't appear to have any doctors, nurses, teachers, universiety academics, lawyers, judges..  Nothing there.  You have these people without the willingness and or abiltiy to do the job for which they are paid taking all the money and keeping other people poorly as slaves.  There is nobody home ffs.  Nothing here at all.</p>

                                <p>The GP's will not retire when tehy get to retirement age.  No voluntarily.  They think that by refusing to sign off on completion of anybody else's training they will get to keep their pay packets until the day they die.  Justice Toogood was reappointed from his retirement (which is not the proocess for appointing Judges) so that he could refuse to find anything wrong with the death of Olivia Podmore and Mason Penddrous in State Care.  He didn't see anything wrong.  They wouldn't release Podmore's health records to her parents but they claim she voluntarily suicided.  He rotted for 1 month in a university residential hall and the University was collecting more and more money from having him enrolled when he was f*ckign well dead.  A supposed or apparent High Court Judge who was not appointed by proper process at all declares that he sees nothing wrong.  He can't see anyting wrong.  So they payroll him to find that NZ universities can do anything they want. The Education and Training Act does not apply to them.  They can say they have enrolled whoever they want into whatever qualification they want (send that info to the IRD) they can refuse to get students work out to eternals to keep them reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled.  They can keep false enrolment records and false transcripts and he doesn't see anything wrong.</p>

                                <p>And Justice Toogood can keep getting payrolled to see absolutely nothing wrong with anything teh governmetn does for the next...  50 years?  Until the day he dies, I'm sure.  We don't need to graduate any lawyers.  We can just draw a circle aroundt he present ones and they can collude, then, to never sign off on anybody else therefore the present lot can collect up all the money that there is for that into the indefinate future.  Make hostages of us all.  Until the NZ administration gets taken over by some other country, I suppose.  Because there doesn't appear to be anything at all here.  </p>

                                <p>Corruption.  THey refuse to get rid of people who are unwilling and or unable to do their job.  In fact, that seems to be an essential part of the job description.  I can't imagine anybody doing a  better job of undermining the quality and integrity of NZ Universities than Chris Whelan.  Nothing could be more detrimantal to the quality and integrity of them than throwing away complaints of wrongdoing instead of working to put the wrongs right and build something worth being a part of.  Garbage f*cking stupid-land.  There's nothing there.</p>

                                <p>There isn't a health system because you have these f*cking idiots without the willingness and / or abiltiy to the do the job thinking that the only way they get to keep their money is by preventing and prohibiting and exterminating anybody who  might competitition for them getting their next pay increase.  There's nothing there.  Overtaken by psychopaths.  Right, Sterelny? The world is so hostile there's only sex and then you die and you seek out and destroy and co-operation so that alllllll of the funding for you only game in town. </p>

                                <p>How many years of thesis writing research work did the ANU take from Dave Wall before he got to the point of being hospitalised?  Then you give glucose before vitamins so he goes into a coma and nearly dies.  Then you wouldn't need to give him his PhD at all. That means you win.  Right?  How many years of thesis writing research work did the ANU take from Carl Brusse before it acknowledged he had done enough for credit for a 3 year or 360 point PhD?  How many years?  How many years of research work does the ANU collect form studnets only to untimley death them and bully them into leaving because...  There's nothign there.  Hey.  If all the people send you their research because they want publications then you can simply delaly it until they are bullied away and reattribute it to people who don't actually do anyting except bully everybody with the willingness and abiltiy to do the f*cking work away.  F*cking horrible bullies.  Nothing there,  hey.  Nothing worth being a part of .  Nothing.</p>
