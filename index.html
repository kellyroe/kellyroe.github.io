                              <a href="writing/gogoethics.png" target="_self">Who wants to do their very very best to cause or induce cardiovascular disease in pacific island people (in the name of `equity targets', no doubt)?  </a> 



                              <p>
                                  I wonder how many applications they will get for that one.  I wonder how many people will actually pay the 'University' (bring external sources of funding with them) in order to murder death kill pacific islanders.  I wonder how it gets through the ethics board.  Do you?
                              </p>

                              <p>Or maybe it's a phoney ad, and they got hacked.  Or maybe not.  I mean...  This is the only kind of reseach the government will fund, or something?  How was it that Dr Leeks was payrolled for however many years and then moved to Melbourne to better facilitate his ongoing crimes?  How could that be?  Oh, but it isn't any different from what various other people on payroll are up to.  And that is precisely why they payroll them.  Isn't that right?</p>

                              <p>See, we start with abusing rats.  Or maybe insects, and then rats. Then move our way up the great hierarchy of being.  Dogs and cats and pigs and monkeys.  Then 'equity targets' of indegenous peoples from all about the world.  Then we get to the trailor trash the indentured servants who will die of maleria when it's time for us to pay them (all voluntary-like) and then...  Why then we can  be all opportunistic when various high ranking officials get sick.  Someone calls an abulance on them, or something.  A momentary vulnerability.  Get in there and have a go.  Fake it till ya make it.  Take it then you have it.  Nasty brutish and short.  Taken over by over taken by psychopaths.  No other game in town.  Nobody else need apply.</p>

                              <p>I wonder if they hired a brown face to market the marketing of the important targeted research?</p>

                              <p>I wonder how many people actually voted in the 'Voice' election.  Various aboriginal people were saying it was politicised and divisive..  The sort of targeting that we do.  Wherever we have our sights on the food chain.  The great hierarchy of being.  With people trying their very very busy best to become gods.  No conception of anything higher than themselves.</p>

                              <p>I don't mean how many people voted 'yes' or how many people voted 'no' I mean how many people voted in total.  I wonder how many NZers actually voted in total in the recent election.  Do you think that 5 per cent of the eligible voting population actually cast a vote?  That would actually surprise me.  I don't think that that many people think that they are living in a democracy.  How many people between the ages of 20 and 65 actually have full time (1 FTE) employment in Australasia?  When the government is the major employer?  How many?  1 in...  5?  I would bet the answer would be less than that.  All the people kept in hospital.  Kept in prison.  Kept on various forms of government welfare.  Kept bullied (by government officials) to being inducted into gangs and held in gangs.  Kept dependent.  A government FTE salary is supposed to support how many dependents?  What democracy?  Ffs.</p>

                              <p>https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2023/10/students-staff-at-massey-university-call-for-vice-chancellor-to-resign-ahead-of-more-cuts.html  I thought I read they were expanding into Singapore.  Closing down the NZ branches and opening branches in Singapore.  Not sure why.  Maybe so that the University will be tried by the courts in Singapore rather than the courts in New Zealand?  That would make sense.    </p>

                              <p> https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/125009.Faces_in_the_Water  What has changed?  When it was time for them to pay her (to teach) they locked her up in an institution.  What has changed?  No money for her to be paid to write.  It's sooooo competitive!  Various people get all the money to be writers!  It's soooo competitive!  What has changed? </p>

                              <p>Of course there aren't any psychiatrists, in NZ.  The only ones we will acknowledge say they have too much of a workload they will not teach anybody else.  They don't have any time to research.  They are the only game in town.  They have been the only ones since forever and they have no plans whatsoever to retire.  They don't want students to witness the institutions they've made and managed and so on.  They don't know any other way.  Massive overprescription of old generation antipsychotics to induce tardive dyskinesias etc.  Not even trying to be theraputic.  Punative punative punative.  Bullying and abusive.  1960's style behaviourist practically clicker training patients to do this or that in return for a cigarette.  Or vapes, now, is it?  In return for benzodiazapines?  Maybe a little fast food?  Maybe a little food?  Are the homo sapiens functioniong like good chickens doing a little anything anything anything for a bit of food if you keep them at 80 per cent their free range bodyweight?  </p>

                              <p>Best advertise from overseas.  See how much money you can scam people into paying for visa reprocessing.  Then they can come here for 10 days and you can kill their kids and institutionalise their wife and they will be lucky to get out alive!  That's the kiwi way?  How many hundreds of students they record being enrolled in medical training?  So they can hire people who never went to medical school to teach them a general undergraduate curriclum.  Then you can let them loose in a playschool type of environment with no supervisision before bullying them into going away.  Are they even graduating them?  To do what, now?  To  be positioned in the ED?  THen the managers and administrators will tell them the patient flow decisions that have been made and so on.  They basically just stick their heads out.  If the GP didn't call in advance (what GP) there aren't any doctors in the hospital, anyway.  Let's see the row information on the payroll.  Who is payrolled to be doctor in the hospital?  What health system?  What education and training system?  What graduates?  What employees?  FFs.  There's nothing there.  Hey.  F*cking nothing there.</p>

                              <p>Just will not do it.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                              <p>Of course it totally makes sense (Not really) that the University of Waikato would focus on training GPs for RCs (general practitioners for remote or rural communities).  They have the largest hospital (or one of the largest hospitals) in Australasia right there, on their doorstep.  Of course they would totally ignore that fact and focus on training GPs for RCs.</p>

                              <p>Why would they want to focus on GPs for RCs?  I guess the idea is that they want to keep the students out of the hospital, really.  They don't want the UN inspectors in there etc.  They seem to be doing everything they can to have the specialist trainings shut down.  So that way they don't have graduates in there.  They want to keep people who know about things out.  I would imagine or suppose.  They want to focus on having maximum students enrolled in their 'graduate training progarmme' and they won't need to employ anybody to teach them. I imagine the idea is to put them in small groups of 5 or 6 and give them a case study (a patient file, of sorts) and tell them to teach each other or figure it out amongst themselves.  What they think is going on, what generic medications to throw at them etc etc.  Then they can put them in 'work placements' who knows where...  Maybe get a house for them to live in and they can have patient clinic out of their bedrooms.  It isn't like there is any alternative.  Right?  Then the patients can come to them and they can practice their breast exams and prostate exams and rectal exams.  Tell them 'awww there's nothing that modern medicine can do for you'.  Withhold antibiotics in the name of not wanting to create resistent strains (also having an interest in observational studies of the natural progression of syphilis and the longitudinal effects of rheumatic fever) and the like..  Is that the grand plan?</p>

                              <p>Isn't it great that Justice Toogood was reappointed from his retirement to not see anything wrong with the Univesrity of Waikatko recording enrolments in programmes of study that the student never applied to!  Isn't it wonderful!  Isn't it great that the Ministry of Social Developmetn proclaimed 'justice is not an essential need' and that the courts have refused to overturn that judgment, nearly 1 year post-substantive  hearing of the issue.</p>

                              <p>F*cking hell, NZL.  Why the...  Determination.  That there not (and never will be) anything here.  FFS.  F*cking hell.  How hard can it possibly be to process an application to enrol in the programme the student applied to (only)?   How hard can it be to get a thesis submitted for the purposes of examination (only) out to externals?  You'd think it would f*cking kill them to sign off on completion of their studnets research.  Hey.  'There will be a job for you only over my dead body'.  Well, then, you've made YOUR choice.  Hurry up and die, then, you selfish f*cking prick. YOU WOULD HAVE THINGS NO OTHER WAY.  Over 65.  More than 45 years of government payroll for you to prevent and prohibit development.  Get the f*ck out already.  Mate.  F*ck off now.  You hear!  F*cking hell...</p>

                              <p>See, it's likely not actually safe to travel to NZL.  I mean to say the GOVERNMENT is the major employer.  The way the migrants to NZ are treated -- the way they are bullied and abused into paying for visa re re re re processing and not paid for the work they do once they arrive etc.  The GOVERNMENT IS THE MAJOR EMPLOYER.  The named employer.  The employer the visa is tied to.  The government is the main bully and abuser.  The liar.  The swindler.  The scummy scummy scammer.  The people lured here to do skilled work (to be paid for skilled work) as specialist medical doctors and nurses and so on.  To be not paid as a healthcare assistant.  Etc.  So the big payrolls can go to the VC's daughter to go off and play golf, or similar.  There's really nothing here.</p>

                              <p>They just won't do it.</p>

                              <p>The number of people I know who arrived to NZ to do a 3 year PhD extendible to 4 years.  Who were told that they needed to pay out of pocket additional fees else they would never give them their qualification completion.  5 years...  6 years..  People start getting sick.  Reporting sickness and disease.  After you do the work for a year or two and all you hear back from the Univesrity is how garbage garbage garbage rubbish rubbish.  Bullying and abusive.  After you give them 3 years of work..   Garbage garbage garbage.  Bullying and abusive.  What are you supposed to do?  Oh.  Now's about the time that people get sick.  Are you supposed to just keep handing over work for more bullying and abuse?  Or stop working.  Then they can say you are lazy?  What are you supposed to do?  IMpossible situation.  Just give them all your work and walk away.  When it's time for them to pay you.  They won't do it.  Visa taken back.  Lucky to run away with your life.  Scummy hoax of a f*cking scummy scam.  The government 'Univesrities'.  No private universities of Austarlasia.  They won't get the work to externals. They won't schedule oral defenses if externals request them.  They just won't do it.  What a f*cking joke a f*ckign hoax a f*cking scummy scam.  They will not train their workers.  There's nobody home.  Nothing there ffs.</p>

                              <p>Is it the Australasian administration or is it external administration. That's what I don't understand. Does the NZ and Australian government intend to treat everybody as badly as they can get away with it...  Haha what are you going to do about it?  You and whose army!!  Haha!  Or is it that they legit get hacked etc from the USA or, whatever.  I mean to say the Australasian goverment isn't responsible for it's own visa processing etc -- because it just doesn't have the capaciaty to do it.  They can't keep hospital records.  They can't keep student records.  They can't keep transcripts or enrolment records.  They can't do payrolls.  Apparently.  Lack the capacity or capability to actually pay the workers (and only the workers).  Can't do it.  Won't do it.  Can't do enrolments.  Can't track qualifications.  Can't do won't do registrations.  Can't keep accurate records about debt.  Likely can't manage an accurate risk of known sexual predators (e.g., Dr Leeks).  Can't do it.  Won't do it.  Nothign there.  Hey.  Nobody home.</p>

                              <p>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/emails-warn-of-staffing-crisis-at-canterburys-forensic-mental-health-service/EZI4NHNLNFE4VLZ3ACXOFPGVWM/  Of course it't not in their patients interests to actually appear before the judge.  The police did not consider anybody else in relation to the crime.  The persons confession was accepted as a confession even when the person was regarded to be too mentally unwell to stand trial.  They were mentally unwell enough to have provided a credible confession but not mentally well enough to actually stand trial.  It was never at issue whether she killed the kids (or whether the employer did so the employee would flee after 10 days work without being paid).  Was he paid to be orthopedic surgeon for 10 days?  Best orthopedic hire ever!  Nobody from NZL could ever be employed to work that job!  Rather, a foreigner pays for visa processing and pays (likely) for a stay in quarantine.  Does 10 days work. Then, when it's time to pay him, he arrives home to be told his employer (the DHB) has taken his wife into custody and she's confessed to killing the kids.  How much did he pay NZ to be made bachelor again?  Did he get paid for his 10 days of orthopedic hire?  How much money did NZ make out of the whole situation?  Well..  Now they need to hire a psychiatrist to look after the wife for how many years in the psychiatric hospital?  We don't have enough people in NZ REQUESTING psychiatric care we need to recruit from overseas, it seems.  Not enoguh locals to fill the hospitals.  Sorry, the 'hospitals'. The plan is to recruit someone from overseas to staff the psychiatric hospital, now?  THey are to come with how many people to make how much work for forensic pathologists...  How many of them will be held hostage indefinately in NZ 'hospitals', then?  </p>

                              <p>What education and training system?  What a f*ckign scummy hoax of a f*cking scummy scam.  Not even trying, hey.  Can't even / won't even process an application to enrol.  Can't even / won't even process a graduation.</p>

                              <p>How much time is there between when you start applying for jobs and when you get one, then?  What is the frictional unemployment, in NZ?  Oh, the problem is supposed to be a mis-match between the skills people have and the skills we want people to have.  You mean the skills people have and the fact that we will never pay them?  We will get people from overseas to pay and pay and pay and pay and pay to come here, lured with false promises about how if they do the work for however long then we will pay them.  But then we declare them dead of maleria or covid or psychiatrically disturbed.  Dead or disabled.  When it's time for us to pay them!  Hey!!  Nobody saw that coming!  Hey!  What a f*cking hoax of a scummy scummy scam.</p>

                              <p>Australaisa. Do not travel.  It's not safe to travel, hey.  They aren't processing visas.  They won't pay the workers.  There's nothing here, hey.</p>

                              <p>It's actually not about the money.  It's not about the money at all.  It's everything else.  'The people the people the people' they say.  It's about the people.  Yes, it is.  The bullying and abuse.  That's what it's about.  It's about bullying and abusing the people.  They will have things no other way.  It's soooo competitive!  It's sooooo hostile!  Everybody is just falling over each other, gnawing each other's arms off, to be picked out to be special most favored one for me!  I get to do anything anything anything and others just fall over themselves, gnaw each others arms off it's soooo competitive!  It's all about the people the people the people fighting to do anyting anything anything anything everything everything give up their lives to lay down and die all for me!  Me and my property my people my people my people!  Me me me me me!</p>
