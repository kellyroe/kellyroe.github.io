    <p>To be fair...  If I was High Court Judge I probably would have found...  That the case was (in precedent) most relevantly similar to the Jehovah's Witness case.  So relevant precedent was in favor of taking custody from the parents.  I mean to say that I think (for whatever that is worth) that the High Court decision was probably the right one for that court to make and for those reasons.  I wonder if they will appeal the decision.  I hope that they do.  The Court of Appeal is less constrained by precedent.  I'm not entirely sure how that goes...  I think the Court of Appeal is allowed to (it's role is to) consider issues more widely than focusing on precedent...  I don't know.  The Bill of Rights does say that we have the right to refuse Medical Treatment.  But it is one thing to refuse Medical Treatment for oneself and a different thing entirely to refuse Medical Treatment on behalf of someone else when we simply don't know what the would want for himself later in life..  If he got to look back and say what he wished to have happened...  Don't know.  Nobody knows.  It must be really hard to stand by, sometimes, and see people make what we believe to be bad, wrong, harmful decisions when it comes to their kids and the like.  But the Government can't step in and take custody of all the kids...  I mean to say precedent is that that situation never does turn out well...  I don't nkow about the blood service thing.  More tailored treatment...  I don't know why it would be an unreasonable burden on NZ's blood service to be handling it's own blood products instead of shipping things to and fro from Australia.  But then, given the state of our  health service (can't even process an applicaton to enrol or keep accurate or secure health records) etc etc...  I do think it is concerning that, well, the Court of Appeal really should consider that it is a polarising decision that will make it a whole lot less likely that quite a few people will present their kids for healthcare, now.  People will hide away from the health system, most likely, because they don't want the Government taking control of their kids.  Sit in their rockers on their porches oiling their rifles or something, in case the government shows up.  Get off my property.  One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand.  Boom.  Still.  I suppose it is a good thing when the demand on health services is reduced?  Apparently there is no shortage of people being ramped etc etc.  Just so long as all the beds are filled and they get x amount of dollars for filling each bed every night...  I suppose that's how the hostage funding works...  Prove me wrong?  One consent form for every patient...  Or exactly how many are being held involuntarily in State care?  Under the care of a physician, you say?  Lisence and registration number, please...
    </p>

    <p>I mean, what was the blood services' reason or excuse or what have you for choosing to hire a KC (how much money did that cost) to take the issue to court?  Rather than...  Simply collecting blood units from unvaccinated donors as the parents requested?  Their rationale or reason was that they were afraid that if they did this once for one person...  Then they would have to do it always for every person.  But there isn't enough for every person to be forced to have the treatment requested by the one.  Therefore the one cannot have what the one is asking for...  I just mean it's a method or style or pattern of argument that is used repeatedly in New Zealand to try and justify why it is that some people have their needs or whatever denied by others when there actually are the resources available for their need or request to be met.  The excuse given by the person with power for their being withholding is 'if we let you do this we would  be forced to force it upon everyone in the name of equity and there isn't enough for everyone to be forced to do it therefore no to you'.  Only they don't usually say about forcing others...  They think that if one person has this then everybody else will want it.  Because they think that people are sheep, like that.  Not very many people did feel strongly opposed to vaccination.  If they had have let people who felt very strongly about it not be vaccinated (without teh bullying aspect to the complaince) then they likely would have had very high vaccination rates.  By trying to force everyone or bully everyone a whole  bunch of people who wanted one in the name of science did not want one in the name of political dissent.  When 'no' is not upheld then one does not have the power to say 'yes'.  I mean to say there is no such thing as informed consent when they refuse to allow or uphold peoplel's decision to say 'no'.  </p>

    <p>Some people are a bit...  Flexible.  Meh.  Could go either way, don't really mind.  Susceptible.  To things like 'don't think about freely smoking freely the free smoke freely smoking smoking freely frequent reminders to freely think about smoking freely' campaign messaging brought to you by the people trained in congnitive psychology 'don't think about oranges!' techniques...  Kind of mixed message marketing public health campaigns...  Or the 'stick it to' whatever it was campaign.  Or whatever.  I don't quite know what is going on..  If they don't really pay the people who work on these things or if they pay them too much or what the issue is...  The dumb and dumber show...  But, anyway...  There are relatively few people who feel strongly enough to go out on a limb.  The government seems to think that these people can simply be railroaded over since they are the few...  But seeing how the few are treated shows the many or the masses that they don't have the powr to say 'no'.  ANd the flexibility or amenability or good will they felt sort of melts away...  Paradoxical process or something.</p>

    <p>I suspect it's largely driven by America.  The idea being that NZ hasn't had a civil war over slavery yet.  That the civil war was a necessary, maybe, part of the development of the freedoms that people have in the US.  Including the freedom to be stupid.  Yes.  To make decisions that the Government wholeheartedly believes are wrong and stupid.  I mean to say.  That the Government and the Courts will uphold people's right to be stupid, quite a lot, because the main reason why they go on and on and on about 'United' states and nationalism and so on is to try and get and keep people pulling together when things are really very fragmented and divided and hanging on by strnds or threads from within, a lot of the time.  I mean to say the threat of disintegration into civil war or outright chaos is more imminent than anybody likes to suppose.  That's why the state of politics is as it is..  Trying to keep all interest groups feeling enough heard or represented to prevent outright anarchy.  Or something...  Anyway, yes.  I can imagine the social engineering experiment is indeed to manufacture civil war in NZ over the issue of slavery.  Is that the plan?  I guess teh US always was good at manufacturing weapons and also reasons for war...  Yeah... </p>

    <p>I mean the endless succession of excuses about why people can't have things they want or whatever.  There is never enough to go around.  And then you point out that there is plenty.  At which point, eventually, the issue is openly admitted to be 'but we have the power to say no and so we say no hahaha and what are you going to do about it?'  Kinds of pettiness.  Suck up and kick down.  ANd some people are particularly fun to kick, one can only suppose.</p>

    <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/world/480302/us-to-increase-rotational-military-presence-in-australia-invite-japan  Hmm.  I wonder if they are going to help Australia choose to be rule by law and uphold it's constitutional obligations to New Zealand.  That would be nice.  Seems Pharmac is getting some medications recently.  That's nice.  New Zealanders are sick and tired of being relegated to contributing the control group of 'no treatment' on the observational studies of various rare conditions etc etc in the world health research.</p>

    <p>https://cos.northeastern.edu/psychology/  Right.  That's right.  Don't think about oranges.  Do the public health people not study psychology, or did they take the content out of the psychology degrees, more recently, or were they not at school that day or...  Who funded the smokefree campaign, then?  Benson and Hedges?  I think...  It was ironic, like that.  Up until the smoking people moved into vapes.  Once they understood the potential for changing the recipe in the vaping such that it could be made to be many many many times more addictive than tobacco ever was etc etc.  Of course nobody in public health saw that one coming when they were being paid by the tobacco companies, one can only suppose, to normalise people smokign tehir crack pipes in public etc etc.</p>
