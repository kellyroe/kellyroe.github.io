                                <a href="https://kellyroe.github.io/writing/realmecv.pdf">Chronological CV</a>
                             </p>

                             <p>This site is the first webpage (or webpages) that I built.  I know it does not look particular good from modern aesthetic or design point of view.  I was mostly concerned to self-publish content that various supervisors or universities either did not get out for external examination or did not give me appropriate credit for.</p>

                             <p>I suppose also to write my perspective on the cases that I brought before the courts.  I was not vexatious.  I was not litigous.  I did everything I could to have things settle without legal action.  Others decided to teach me a little lesson in how NZ is not even trying to have a functioning judiciary, or something.  I don't quite know what the point or purpose was of Quigley instructing me to initiate legal action against the University of Waikato for (1) refusing to enrol me in a programme I applied to (2) recording I was enrolled in a programme I never applied to (3) refusing to get work out for external examination (4) requesting examination for the wrong qualifiction (5) refusing to base the outcome of examination on the reports of the external examiners (6) refusing to appoint a third examiner in the case of divergent outcomes.  Just not doing any of the things that they are supposed to do when it comes to them processing graduate student research.  I suppose the idea is that it simply does not matter.  The courts won't stop them.  And now, apparently, the NZ government plans to allow them to record students being enrolled in medical qualifications.  They can put them to 'work' in the 'hospitals' in the name of their workplace internships and they can pay and pay and pay and pay and pay the 'university' until they are replaced by new students.  </p>

                             <p>And so that's what they will do, then.  Nobody else seems to have a problem with it.  Chris Whelan is both overwhelmed by complaints and also in the position where not a single person has made a complaint of serious wrongdoing about any of the 'Universities' of NZ.  </p>

                             <p>They just don't seem to be trying to be fair.  Not even a little bit.  The aim is to be a slave prison detention camp land where we lure migrants under false promises and they go away when it is time for us to pay them.  Of couse they do.  Suicide.  Are suicided.  All voluntary-like.  What Universities?  But then what health system?  What judiciary?</p>

                             <p>The whole time I was at the Australian National University (through a summer research scholarship and then however many years that they kept me enrolled in doctoral study without providing any supervisory comments on my thesis and without getting it out to external examiners) I never saw any student have a scheduled oral defence to publically defend their thesis.  I did not see any evidence at all of any student being presented with reports from external examiners offering critique of their thesis.  I don't know how the 'University' decided which studnets to give PhD's to, and when.  I don't think that they treated me fairly at all, in fact.  Anyway, I self publish the work that I did for them while I was enrolled with them beacuse I can only be responsible for the work that I did.  Various people were on payroll to supervise me.  They only had a handful of research students at any one time and they had no teaching committments to either graduate or undergraduate studnets.  The University administration was given my table of contents which informed them that I had more than 100,000 worrds of research output -- and they never contacted me about when it was going to be forwarded to externals.  I can't say that I'd recommend anybody enrol in doctoral level qualification in Australasia.  Else, if you do, plan to physically remove yourself from the environment (and cut all contact) after you have given them a doctoral thesis after 2 years of work.  Either they get it out to external examiners or you publish it yourself.  You did the work that you were supposed to do for the doctoral programme.  They payroll various people to not do any of the things that they are supposed to do.  The environment is bullying and abusive.  You don't enrol in a PhD or doctoral thesis because of the people, that's for sure.</p>
