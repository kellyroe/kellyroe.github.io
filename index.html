 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">
                    
                            <article>

                            <p>Suppose you wanted to make a bunch of money researching and treating people for x.  The first thing you might well have an interest in doing is increasing the amount of people with x.  Whether it be HIV, Covid, antibiotic resistent bacteria.  How are these things transmitted?  How are they tested for.  Gee...  Couldn't *testing* people in a certain special kind of way be a *method or mechanism on transmission?*  Why, that would be ingenious in psychopath land!  What mechanisms or structural things are in place to ensure that that kind of thing doesn't happen?  What are we supposed to think when we discover them throwing away applications, refusing to graduate studnets when they have met requirements for qualifications, refusing to publically advertise jobs, refusing to employ obviously capable candidates for the position etc etc etc.  So as to redeploy known offenders and the like into these kinds or sorts of positions?  Dr Leeks and so on.  Most beloved.  What are we supposed to think, then?  THey say nobody else applied.  B*llh*t.  They are full of complete and utter b*llsh*t.  The Medical 'Professions' response to the Cartwright Inquiry was 'poor poor Dr Green it wasn't like he was doing anything that anybody else who would be recognised as a Medical Doctor in New Zealand isn't or wouldn't be doing'.  They are dragging their heels over the abuse in state care inquiry for hte reason that they are still at it.  They genuinely don't see anything wrong with those kinds or sorts of things being done.  It isn't like what happened in the abuse in state care inquiry is any different from what is considered 'normal' 'usual' 'typical' 'standard' if not 'compulsory' to be rolled out to as many people as possible in the present.  F*cking psychopaths.  Won't have or allow things to be any other way. </p>

                            <p>Look at the research outputs.  How many words of research are people on payroll to research outputting every year?  And then look at the kind of research that is done (partiuclarly anything funded) so you can see how the research dollars allegedly or apparently go into such really important and worthwhile studies as 'we thoguht this was maybe harmful but we needed to document it for quite some time to be sure so people or animals must be kept like that so we can record the extent of the harms'.</p>

                            <p>But then they pay Chris Whelan to throw away comlaints of wrongdoing (he says the only complaint he acknoweldges as a complaint was mine -- because the High Court Judge said that I actually did lodge one so the courts have ruled that he actually received one).  But it didn't matter that he recieved one because...  The laws don't apply to him because he writes the policy, or something, which means he doesn't have to follow the policy he wrote because he can change it retrospectively to do anything anything anything.  That's why they pay him quarter of a million dollars per year to throw complaints away.  But even if he didn't throw them away he doesn't have to show them to anybody else or action them at all.  In fact, the High Court Judge said that he would be oversteppign his bounds if he actually got evidence to police to assist prosecution or if he held a meeting of the NZVCC so that the University VC's could get their heads together and brainstorm on the issue and figure out amongst themselves what their statutory requirements were on their conduct regarding how they handle applications to enrol, progressions through training (including getting studnets work that has been submitted for examination out to externals to be examined for the qualification the student applied to and basing the outcome on the reports which means allowing the externals to sign off on the students work).</p>

                            <p>But New Zealand doesn't appear to have a health system.  Or an education system.  There don't appear to be any universities.</p>

                            <p>I am thinking very particularly, now, about the efforts to give people rheumatic fever.  I was thinking it was more about housing, before, but now I suspect that is a red herring.  I would expect the bacteria are intentionally being transmitted around in hospital environments.  I mean to say I would think that actually it would be more likely to find that they are not engaging in best practices when it comes to antibiotics, or they are engaging in practices known to be best for transmission of antibiotic resistent bacteria.  They want to develop a vaccine for it, you see.  So they have yet another reason to give children needle stick injuries.  Who does?  The 'Medical Profession'.  </p>

                            <p>The 'Profession' who can't process an application to enrol.  Who won't sign off on studnets qualifications when they have done enough for them.  The 'Profession' who most highly values Dr Leeks.  All these upstanding and esteemed people..  It isn't plausible to think that anybody forged documentation that would have University of Auckland cadavar laboratory tutors allow someone who wasn't on the roll in the classroom.  I mean, there is no way that he forged himself onto the class roll now, is there?  Either he was enrolled in the class (he was on the class roll) or he was not.  I think it most likely that *when it was time to pay him for the work that he had done in the hospital* they decided they didn't want to pay him so it was time for him to go away.  That's pretty much what New Zealand does.  Right?  When it is time to pay.  Either actual dollars.  Or qualifications. When requirements for qualifications have been met.  They won't hand over qualifications, either.  Because then their slaves might go away.  They aren't going to pay them.  And they aren't going to write them references or give them credit or qualifications for the work that they have done either.  F*cking psychopaths.  Hey.</p>

                            <p>Why wouldn't pregnancy be a competition?  The male gets to eat the baby.  The male wins!  How difficult is it to see that?  THe female could eat the baby.  It's like putting something away..  THen it goes off into the world and cry cry cries for government handouts (say) so she gets a return on her investment.  Hey.  Everybody wins.  Well, everybody except the baby.  What's that?  We all lose.  Sure.  Everybody will die one day.  Their nasty bruitish and short little lives will be over.  Lose-lose.  The world that they made.  </p>

                            <p>The world that who made?  Why the elite happy few!  The world that they made!  So they can look down upon the unruly rabble and feel  better about their extermination policies and the like because they don't see any people.  Shows like 'Better Call Saul' and 'Breaking Bad' and even courtroom dramas of the 'Dr Leeks and Dr Green' variety are all just designed to market to the masses that 'there is no alternative'.  'This is the nature of our class'.  'Everybody is a psychopath in our class and opportunitistic.'  So they can convert each other like prions, you see.  Convince or persuade everyone that there is no other way to be.  So the elite can go 'see!  see!  see!' and feel justified ensuring that Dr Leeks and Dr Green etc get stationed into position.</p>

                            <p>I mean life is very differnet for the 'cool kids'.  Is it not?  The kids who are expediated through quickly quickly quickly so they can play military hospital in Christchurch, and the like.  What fun!  What 18 year old boy wouldn't want to experience cervical examinations up close and personal and expereince the fun of having control over anasthetics and the like.  Particularly in a borderland nation where you can do anyting anything anything to the vermin with complete and utter imunity.  Right?  I mean...  How much would you pay?  </p>

                            <p>I mean they just refuse to do things properly.  Won't calculate a GPA according to their published criterion.  Won't enrol studnets in courses they have applied to.  It isn't that more studnets applied than places available in teh course, even, because I intentionally applied to a programme that had no other applicants.  Ffs.  Just beyond ineptitude.  Really.  Refusing to enrol studnets in programmes they have applied to in order to teach them a little lesson in or about complince, apparently.  Because NZ is just a great big detention camp, or something.  NO difference between the education institutions or aged care institutions and the quarantine institutions or the prison instiatutions or the hospital institutions.  Just punative institutions of abuse up and down the land.  Why?  So that the governmetn can run off of the proceeds of crime, apparently.  Not pay the workers.  The 'workers' pay the government in exhange for opportunities granted to them to pimp the prisoners or hostages or slaves or victims or vulnerable out.  Make a living off of the proceeds of crime.  PUt in a plan for how you will keep some segement under your observational watch in conditions of harm and deprivation.  It's how to get government funding.  Right?     </p>

                            <p>Won't process applications to enrol.  Won't give out applications.  WOn't publically advertise jobs.  WOn't hire the most qualified for the job (Ashley did not apply for PhD, do a PhD, did not tutor or grade or work in a University ever but now he is Professor?), won't pay the workers.  There's nothing here.  They aren't even trying just a teeny tiny little bit, at all.  </p>

                            <p>Just a garbage wasteland of complete and utter sh*t.</p>

                            <p>Let me guess.  I must have a baby.  So that you can eat it.  Otherwise I would be selfish.  Riiiiiiight.  That's what selfish meeeeeeeans.</p>

                            <p>Are the Philosophers at the University of Waikato people who were chosen to be put on payroll in the Department only because the University thought that they didn't have the capacity to output more than about 5,000 words of research every 2 or 5 years...  Or does the University artificially or forcefully limit the amount of research that they are allowed to present?  I mean to say, they aren't allowed to present new research in departmental seminars or conferences.  I know journals are more difficult because of editors saying that their work has been held up indefinately in the peer review process (while giving it away to others to recive credit for the work instead)... There is quite the scummy scam on Universities stealing the work and re-attribuing it.  That is the best sense that I can make of how particularly badly I have been treated by the ANU and Waikato.  Is that they are trying to cover-up now or damage mitigate having given my work away to others to get credit for it.</p>

                            <p>Sometimes it is easier to step back and consider how things are with others.  Less personal.  My being less personally involved.  So others can't make it personal.  I mean to say...  Consider Carl Brusse.  He completed at least 2 PhD's with the ANU Philosophy -- right?  The first one was on Personal Identity.  But that work was taken by Princeton.  Wasn't it?  Phillip Petit.  I think.  Something like that.  Apparently they moved his supervisor around so that he was forced to start over if he wanted credit for having completed a PhD at all.  Carl Brusse was not stupid.  Not by any means.  He also was not under-productive.  I remember Kim bullying him for many many years.  His work was garbage, his topic was garbage.  Then Kim would pretend to soften..  He seemed to really like Carl.  Enjoy his company.  Carl could be quite the bubbly socialite life of the party.  So out of the goodness of his heart?  Carl is allowed or permissted to start over again on a new PhD of Kim Sterelny's choosing.  Supply, perhaps even.  But whatever happened to the work that Carl did previously?  On Personal Identity?  Various things..  Stolen by others.  Right?  Carl wasn't bullied into taking 2x as long as everybody else (at least) because he wasn't as bright as everybody else.  He stood out as being one of the brightest ones, in fact.  That was why they wanted him to slave slave slave slave slave...</p>

                            <p>Well then, if Carl can slave for 2x the standard (at least) and also be happy happy face life of the party then what must I do if I want credit?  Die.  I think.  That's basically pretty much wehre everything seems to be at.  Apparently there will be a job for me over their dead body.  I mean to say they aren't saying that there will be a job for me once they are dead.  I'm sure that others will take up that position or posting so that it would be like playign whack-a-mole waiting for all the relevant people to die so that there would be a job for me.  Because of them having stolen and profiteered off of my work alredy.  There is no way that I would steal other people's work the way they have.  That I would reattribute authorship the way that they do.  That I would keep slaves.  So they don't choose me.  Because they are intentionally looking for slavers.</p>

                            <p>They say it is about management of course.  That's how come they can redeploy people from one post into another.  It's all about taking the research outputs and reattributing them around.  The people on payroll to research, I mean to say.  So the Waikato people aren't attributed as having done any.  Because Waikato is supposed to be or is expectedt to be a shitty University.  By which they mean it is low down the pecking or ranking.  By which they mean that the studnets at the low tier institutions hand their work over to the studnets of the high tier institutions (or even the professors) can take credit for it.  So, for example, Penn is now where the Philsoophy of Biology Journal is edited from.  I suppose to enture that the Penn studnets are credited with the best of the work that any studnets will be credited with.  And so on.  That's why they are careful to curate who getst to talk and so on at conferences.  When you speak with people about their (supposed or apparent) research you get a handle on whether it is their work or not.  I see now that is what is going on.  That's why the pressure to drink and talk about social bubbly things not related to work only.  Because people aren't able to keep up...  That's why they wouldn't allow me an oral defence.  That's why the ANU doesn't have or do them.  I remember KIm Sterelny going into bat considerably for many of his studnets.  Handling the entire question time for them or on their behalf, even.  When they go tthe inevitable 'and how is this even philosophy' question.  Because, you know.  There isnt' any philosophy left.  Actually.  Right?  Gutted it of subject matter.  No meaning.  No value.  Not even any co-operation.  Right?  Be co-operative.  Hand over your intellectual baby to me.  Right.  That's what not being selfish means.  All of the work outputs for you so you can collect up all of the money and all of the credit.  All of the honors and awards.  Nobody home.</p>

                            <p>And what are you going to do about it??  RAWK RAWK RAWK!! Scream teh vultures?  Are you going to document our crimes?  Document our crimes?  Document our crimes?  Quite the little Ann Frank isn' she?  Guffaw.  QUite teh Janet Frame.  What's what?  When it's time for you to pay her to teachin the secondary schools someone figured they could make a little money off of her keeping her in a government institution (in teh nameo f psychiatry) and she could documetn their crimes, document their crimes, document their crimes.  Did she get to be writer in residence at Otago?  Say?  For all the literary work she did in NZ?  No?  Who got paid to do that, who got paid for that honor instead?  So that we could wait until she died before acknowledging anything of hers.  QUite the kiwi way.  There's nothing here.  Garbage garbage garbage. </p>

                            <p>The governmetn is being more blatent now about the function of the judiciary being a tool or a mechanism for the governments oppression of the people.  The governmetn thought that Tamaki was getting a few too many supporters, people might actually choose to vote for him.  SO the government got the police to put him in Mt Eden prison.  All the violent offenders and the like who get home detention (or who get re-deployed with payrise in return for their crimes) and the Government chooses to use the courts and prison and police to imprison Tamaki.  The government chooses to use court process to further victimise people harmed by the government.  That's the purpose or the function of the judiciary in NZ.  That is or means to say there is not a functioning judiciary in NZ.  Nobody home.  Nothing there.  We are left with vigilante justice in or at the hands of individuals or gangs or mobs of thugs.  There is nothing else.  The governmetn uses the official to oppress and victimise and pursecute the people.  There isn't a functioning judiciary.  I get invoices, now, from the Auckland District Health Board (or whatever the f*ckign new thing is supposed to be) saying that I owe them money because they chose to hire a Queens Counsel to have my proceedings against them thrown out and the Judiciary said that they were unsuccessful in having the proceednigs thrown out but that there would be no scheduled hearing of the proceedings and I was to pay them for having filed something against them in the first place.  The Supreme Court upheld that decision and awarded more costs against me to them for my having complained to the Supreme Court that this was obviously unjust.  You could read the prceedings yourself lif you cared to.  They document how the High Court Judge said that there did in fact appear to be a case for them to answer to.  Namely, the notes say they drugged me but they had no medication charts.  They say I was required to stay in the hospital (not allowed to leave) when they had no legal grounds to keep me in teh hospital.  Security was positioned to prevent my leaving.  I say it again.  There isnt' a hospital or health system, here.  There isn't a judiciary, here. There is no 'try'.  There is nothing here, at all. The government has declared war on the people.  There aren't any social services.</p>

                            <p>The judges think they have the authority to order people to file and refile and refile and refile and refile and refile and refile their filings.  As many times as they order.  Just as the Universiteis think that they have the authority to order people to do the same.  I guess everywehre.  Right?  Keep on applying for a visa.  By which I mean, never stop, never stop, never stop paying the visa application fee.  Never stop handing over filings or thesees or research or completed application forms.  That's quite teh unpaid slave labor 'job' for you.  Right?  SO the courts can cry cry cry cry cry that they can't keep up with all the filings they ordered to be filed.  </p>

                            <p>So the current idea is that they can find people and take them to the hospital.  Hold them as hostages.  Bill the government for keeping them in a hospital bed.  Collect up money for keeping them as hostages.  Bill the ACC, even, or their insurer for various operations performed on them.  If the patient complains about being involuntarily unlawfully drugged or whatever then the courts will say that the person complaining about such treatment must file and file and file and file with the courts and pay and pay and pay and pay the courts so the courts can processing their filings ordered by the courts to be filed so that the courts can be paid.  And then the hosptial can send invoices to the people saying about how much money they are supposed to pay the hospoital for the hospital having unlawfully involuntariliy detained them in conditions the UN would likely say were torture (only the UN inspectors are not allowed through).  What doctors where there in the hospital?  Any?  What badges and registration numbers?  Were there any doctors in the hospital?  All these 'security staff' to prevent people from leaving so the hospital and now the courts also can say that you are required to opay and pay and pay nd pay.  NEver stop paying, people of NZ, for the crimes of the NZ government.  Never stop paying for the crimes of the NZ government employees.  Apparently or allegedly.  Or, what, the unpaid volunteers, was it?  This is how they make their money?</p>

                            <p>So, now we see the scummy scummy scam.  And understand that there aren't any researchers in the Universities (none on payroll) and there aren't any doctors in teh hospital.  Probably not any judges in the courtroom.  I suppose that is a thing of it.  Etc etc etc.  The prevention and prohibition of development programme for the keeping of slaves.  ANd why it is that the aspiratioaal ideal or goal is for everybody to think you are too f*cking stupid to do any actual work.  Then they might pick you for a paid position.  The prevention and prohibitnio of whatever it was that your job description was.  Right Chris Whelan?  Right Stuart McCutcheon?  Right Professor Glue Factory?  Right New Day Anti-Stagnant SwampWater person (aka Dawn Freshwater).  Do they pay you -- or do you pay them in exhange for getting to pimp the studnets out?  Maybe having them involuntarily detained in teh name of psychiatry and deported without their degrees after you've harvested foetal tissue from them or whatever whatever whatever brings the University money, these days...  Getting the studnets to pay Crimson Educaion else you won't process their examination scripts or whatever.  What did the courts say about that?  That Crimson Education deserved a little privacy?</p>

                            <p>Well.  That's the funny funny funny funny funny funny thing, hey.  Allllllllll of the work from you and alllll of the money to me.  Yeah.  F*cking garbage scum of the wasteland by design.  F*cking idiot imceciles.  Only people (sorry 'people') on payroll.  Yeah.  Right.</p>

                            <p>Permission to treat her badly enough for her to rant about 'garbage scum'.  Approved?  Permission to carry on?</p>

                            <p>Don't worry scum of NZ.  We have arranged NASA scientists for you.  They come to your schools and tell your people they can do anything anytihing anyting to be a NASA astronaut.  Anything anything.  They will do anything anything anything.  Garbage garbage garbage scum.  Permission to carry on?  Permission to carry on????  Allll of the titles and honors and awards and opportunities to teach about garbage scum for you.  Wow. Most desirable.  Yeah, right.</p>

                            <p>Didn't you know that old people are stupid? Let's do teh time warp (again)...  Old people are stupid. QUickly quicly quicky expediated though.  LEt's do the time warp again...</p>

                            <p>Rocky Horror Picture Show.  SO... World leading..  ALl the Boston freaks can destination of NZ...  So intriguing...  Let's do the time warp, again...  Let's put a statue up in Waikato industry leading...  Normal sexual behavior in NZ..  Let's do the time warp again..</p>

                            <p>I think we say 'clue.  Get a clue'  That's a saying.  Try the film 'Clue'.  to Get a clue.  Let's do the time warp again...  IS what you say when people are forced to follow in your footsteps however many generations or centuries behind.  Let's do the time warp, again...  (Becaue they are too stupid to catch up).  So now they're promoted.. to industry lead...  Let's do the time warp again....</p>

                            <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCZDWZFtyWY  Dr Leeks vision -- right?  No....  Wrong.  Dr Leeks was just a cheap mimic of those whose vision it rightly was...  Right?</p>

                            <p>So... There is empathy for the victims of the fallout of what occurred due to... Their breeding programme.. To create the sexual stud that they most desired.  Comprehend.  Aye??</p>

                            <p>The least we can do is sing the song properly...  Just a sweet transvestite...  From New Zeeeeeeeeealand.....</p>

                            <p>I mean to say things were not allowed to be any other way.  It's all entirely voluntary.  Right?</p>

                            <p>And of course we all know that gender is just a variable that the state (not you, not you) assigns at birth.  QUite in spite of despite of in spite of you.  Never because of you and or any of the decisions you made in life.  What, you thought the government did not own you? But you are the outcome of the great breeding programme!!!</p>

                            <p>So they kept a group of men at Hillmorton apparently because they had 'shell shock'.  I bet the government was really really disappointed that they didn't die overseas, or maybe the government was really happy that they could pay some people to keep them imprisoned in NZ.  Apparently they were taken away from their families.  They are trying to locate the family members, now.  I suppose because they are looking for more vulnerable targets since they successfully ended up killing off those ones.  The institiutions weren't even pretending at all to be rehabilitative in any manner or way.  Right?  They were intentionally purposefully built to be prison camps of the punative variety.  Right?  Apparently the problem with the holocaust is primarily that they left survivors.  They are still digging up bones they find in Ireland etc.  But they are more clever now, of course, with using chemicals and the like to dispose of the bones.  So they could even make the prison camps somewhat open to view to international inspectors.  Possibly.  Perhaps.  But why bother?  I mean to say the Nations of the globe are united in the aim or goal of imprisoning as many as they can in as punative conditions as they can for as long as they are getting away with it.  I mean...  It's so *fun* isn't it?  Doesn't it make you feel all big?</p>

                            <p>So...  Was the literary output of Manus Island...  Twice that of the University of Otago English Department, then?  Is that the idea/l?  Put the entire output of the text messages sent from staff through a translation programme or give them the work of a translator..  Sure...  Of course...  I see...</p>

                            <p>There is a tension between, on the one hand, perpetrators getting off on thinking that their victims are to spend the rest of their puny little lives singing about their crimes.  Singing about how powerful they are that they got away with doing various things.  All the glory to the offenders.  Etc.  Immortalised.  Like the glorious Dr Leeks.  Immortalised in the public imagination.  MOtivating and inspiring new generations of people to want to do anything anything anything to become a psychiatrist in a land such as New Zealand!  The unlimited possibility to do anything anything anything anything to the victims they give you.  With complete and utter immunity.  Most valued, even.  And then, on the other hand, if the victims aren't (being forced to) spend the rest of their lives singing about your awfulness and your awful crimes then I guess what you did wasn't that bad, then?  It was perfectly socially normal acceptable sanctioned.  No consequences.  No harm.  No foul.  Carry on.  Either way...  The whole idea/l is that some people are too much power, hey.  </p>

                            <p>That's the only relationship dynamic that there is in Australasia.  The slaver and the slave.  The prison guard and the offender.  They know it's a fine line.  Right?  They could so easily have  ben selected for the other team.  We don't feel bad about the prisoners and the slaves.. Because if luck had have gone differently they would  be getting their jollies doing the very same thing to us (think the offenders).  Right?  The only game in town.  See...  Everybody would have been a Nazi soldier marching the people off to the death camps if they had the opportunity to do so.  That's what makes it okay.  Right?  Right?  That's what Australia wants to tell or teach the world is the lesson of the Holocaust.  Everybody will follow instructions from a person in a white coat.  But you can remove the white coat and everybody will follow the instructions, still.  Else it's off to the death camps they go...</p>
