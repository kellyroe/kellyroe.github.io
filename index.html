                                    I was fairly sure that Ashley Bloomfield did a MBChB BEFORE doing a...  What was that?  A 120 point 1 year Honors Programme followed by a 120 point 1 Year Research Masters?  Or was that a 120 point 1 year Honors Programme followed by a 240 point 2 Year Masters?  Maybe a 2 Year Masters comprised of 1 year of course-work followed by a 1 year thesis?  Anyway...  Waiting for Ashley's salary reveal, now.  
                                </p>

                                    I do not deny that he seemed calm and measured and those kinds or sorts of things that were rightly valued during that time.  Of course, it is easier to come across that way (to be seen to exemplify those characteristics) when one earns half a million dollars per year and when people actually listen to what it is that you have to say.

                                    Regarding competence...  The initial lockdown was not lawful.  But that's okay.  The laws don't seem to matter insofar as certain special snowflakes are concerned.  That's a wonderful message to be sending to the kiddies.  I didn't know that people could or would be appointed Professor (presumably in a non-honorary capacity) without a PhD.  Without extensive publications in the field.  Still...  What 'University', eh?
