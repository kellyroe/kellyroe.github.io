                            <p>Oh God... It was sooo long ago now, I'm trying to remember... Was it 10 or 15 or even 20 years ago...  That Australia was having all these conferences and workshops about 'randomised double blind control trials' and 'gold standard of evidence for medicine' and so on.  And it was...  50 years before that the same things came up in the US?  And what was the point of it all?  Oh...  To bring back the humble case study.  Done right.  Of course nobody will be payrolled to do that.  All the money that goes for people who think they are sooooooo f*cking clever to decide how the money goes around...  To be control group or worst group only on studies that never would have obtained ethics approval in the US.  How low can we go?  Yikes.</p>

                            <p>I think NZ and Australasia generally could do with a little clarification on what constitutes post-enlightenment vs what constituted revelling in the dark ages.</p>

                            <p>https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/national/greymouth-dentist-bharath-subramani-fights-cancellation-after-botched-procedures/  The lengths they go to to ensure this is the only game in town.  All the prospective students who can't get their applications to enrol properly processed.  All the prospective graduates who can't get graduation signed off.  They must live in his basement and be his slavey slave until he dies so maybe they can take up his position, then?  It's sooooooo competitive..  It's sooooo competitive there is really nothing there.  In fact.  At all.  Who wants to be a dentist in Greymouth?  Nobody else need apply.  They have it covered.  Was he a NZ graduate?  Or does he pay and pay and pay and pay and pay for Visa and so on...  For the privaledge of getting to do anything anything anything.  </p>

                            <p>The great circle-jerk.  Right?  Where the pacific islanders think they have 'made it' if they get to NZ.  The NZers think they have 'made it' if they get to Australia.  They only think they have 'made it' if they get to New York. But of course they only think they have made it if they get to move to the Pacific Islands and get to do anything anything anything.  I guess the ideal, then, is to move your way up being a pedophile and rapist and murderer and so on...  Until you get to..  What, exactly?  Do all of that in New York?  Or own the Virgin Islands where the New Yorkers get to go on holiday and do anything anything anything.  Oooooh it's sooooo motivating and inspiring.  Not.  It's sooooo competitive..  There simply doesn't seem to be anything of any value left at all...</p>

                            <p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CbCjQmKViI Oh noes!  The good people of Prague! </p>

                            <p>Another one for Australia.  How many studnets did he train?  How many studnets did he sign off on completion of internships?  How many did he fail out of their internship so that he could be the only game in town?</p>


                            <p>How much was Justice Isac overpaid?  How many pay cheques did he get between when he was supposed to retire and when he eventually did?  How many judgments need to be taken back?  Who was supposed to have been appointed instead?  He stole from that person, you see. And the garbage judgments that resulted from him.  Since he had nothing to lose.  Right?  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/psychologist-sent-inappropriate-texts-to-patient-she-knew-before-therapy-began/ICGLXFG4HFD3BKC7D66V5WBEKM/  Clinical psychology:  It's soooooo competitive!!! It's soooooo competitive!!!!! It's soooooooo competitive they need to limit the number of studnets they enrol in the program and  limit the number of students they graduate from the programme.  They need to limit the amount they register to ensure, beyond any shaddow of a doubt...  The people who are so  high calibre as this can be the Only Game In Town.  That is the nature of the competition.  It's sooooooooooo competitive.  Nobody else need bother applying.  At all.  All the discretion and it's personal used to ensure that this is the Only Game in Town.  It's soooooo competitive.  The esteemed leaders would have things no other way  </p>

                            <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/300930593/father-faces-crossexamination-in-lauren-dickason-murder-trial  Oh come on, now.  New Zealand:  Highest rates of child abuse in the world.  Isn't it?  She would not have been such a desirable immigrant if they had not have documented her liklihood of killing her kids in advance.  Right?  That was what made them such a natural hire.  Such a good fit.  SO perfect, to fit in with everything it is that we value.  Most deirable immigrants ever.  Refusing quarantine places to NZ citizens (including pregnant ones) in order to expediate selection for most valuable people, ever.  Everything it is that NZ values.  In a nutshell. Right there.  Let them be poster children for your immigration campaign.  Who will we recruit next?  Pediatrics  Obgyn?  Cancer  care?  Just think of what is most valued from the perspective of NZ immigration... </p>

                            <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/waikato/132574026/owner-of-dog-that-killed-dayold-baby-gets-community-work-supervision He gets community work..  BEfore he gets a medal.  Right?  For everything it is that we value. </p>

                            <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/494078/un-committee-questions-nz-on-progress-over-lake-alice-abuse-cases  I am intesrested in these decisions.  I did not see any judgments in the favor of the victims.  The Universities of Otago and Auckland are still refusing ot process applications to enrol according to their published algorithm of how they are supposed to do that.  They are not even trying to be fair at all.  They are not even trying to allow people who may have capacity to do psychiatry to do psychiatry, in NZ.  We are too busy recruiting those most likely to murder their kids to be given  citizenship post haste for everything it is that we value.  </p>

                            <p>Not even trying.  Not even a little bit.  Those with willingness and abilty forced to flee or die untimly deaths in conditions of torture.  Not evern trying to be fair, at all. Not even a little teeny tiny bit.  There's nobody home.  Nothing there.  Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/494053/ministry-of-education-challenges-claims-children-sent-home-due-to-lack-of-teachers  Obviously the children weren't sent home  because there weren't enough teachers.  Obvously and clearly the only explanation was that the children were sent home because they were dirty nasty and stupid.  That was why they were sent home.  Why the government did not see fit to pay for them to have teachers.  It wanted to pay for them to have prison guards, a little further downstream.  Then euthanasia experts.  Funeral conductors.  </p>

                            <p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/other-sports/300930462/victorian-government-lashed-for-gross-exaggeration-as-athletes-react-to-commonwealth-games-bombshell  The money is supposed to go to infrastructure projects.  The idea is that things like the Railways can be built (to shuttle tourists around in the first instance) and accommodation can be build (to house athletes and tourists in the first instance) and then the infrastructure remains for the Australian people.  But they can't get the business plan together, I guess.  To justify the intitial spend.  In a country soooooo wealthy in natural resources.  All the rocks.  It takes the rocks from out the ground -- and it hands them over.  No secondary manufacturing capability or capacity whatsoever.  What education and training system?  What health system? What judiciary?  There's nothing there..  Prison slave detention camps up and down the land...  Send them off to die...  There's nothign there. No investment in anything at all...  </p>

                            <p>I don't know why they go on about the 'post-code lottery'.  THe point of it is that it is a 'post-code inevitabilty'.  You were born in NZ (you don't know how unlucky you are!) therefore no health care for you.  What is so hard to understand?  The post-code inevitiability.  The people hand-picked to do surgery etc don't know what informed consent is or means.  What surgeries?  You won't actually pay anybody to work that job.. What jobs..  NZ.  It's not working.</p>

                            <p>NZ doesn't need to train any Orthopedic Surgeons.  We can just hire from South Africa.    It's a great idea.  Best idea ever.  I guess nobody else was going to pay the KC.  I guess the Orthopedic surgeon for 10 days paid for a visa and paid for a KC for his wife etc etc etc.  How much money, then, did NZ make off of our out of the best hire ever?  It's sooooooo competitive.  Soooooooo competitive...</p>

                            <p>They got the 'special exception' or 'special exemption' or whatever visas -- correct?  While NZ was preventing and prohibiting NZ citizens from returning home they made a special exception or exemption for 5 south africans to come into the country.  Apparently  because the guy was sooooo high value in such a competitive speciality!  It's soooooo competitive!  Nobody from NZ was willing or able to work that job.  We had to bring in 5 South Africans (that's a couple + twins +1).  We wanted these people instead of various other NZ citizens who were prevented and prohibited from returning because of the places that the South Africans took up in quarantine.</p>

                            <p>I wonder how much they did pay for visas and so on.  If they did pay for their quarantine.  I wonder how costly their move to NZ was.  Money being handed over by them to the NZ government, I mean to say.  And now, a KC is hired for her defence.  She isn't having a public defender.  She hired a QC.  He did.  I bet that cost more than the 2 weeks of Orthopedics salary that he made.  So...  The whole thing has been quite lucrative for the NZ government, wouldn't you say?</p>

                            <p>If course the money cost of keeping her in prison or psych hospital will be a lot... What was her job?  I thought I read from somewhere that she was a Medical Doctor. Was she a psychiatrist?  Was she?  Is she the new unpaid psychiatrist live in for Hillmorton, then?  Couldn't get anybody to work that job there the traditional way.  The traditional way being when you pay them, I mean to say.  So she can document the crimes document the crimes document the crimes for the UN, or something...  Like the terrorist guy can document teh crimes document the crimes document the crimes of NZ keeping people in state care institutions in conditions the UN inspectors would likely say amount to torture.  This is NZ.  Bullying and abuse.  Will have things no other way.</p>

                            <p>Now we can go back to keeping the Orthopedic position unfilled.  Until we can lure a  new victim here...  We can go back to saying that people who want psych treatment can't have any because the psychiatrist is too busy treating South Africans who have been imprisoned in NZ against their will with clickers or gaslighting or LSD or ketamine or who knows what.  A little nasal polyp removal...  Maybe some ECT...  Maybe to the genitals.  See if you can teach them to have a sexual response to someone with all the appeal of...  Dr Leeks.  That's a funny name.  Dr Leeks.  To train sexual resoponses.  To teach the boys to have sexual responses to grown men.  That was the ideal wasn't it?  That such things could be trained.  That they might grow up to voluntarily pimp themselves out to the..  I don't know.  The judges?  The ones past the age of compulsory retirement for judges?  The ones who will not get out?</p>

                            <p>https://www.seek.co.nz/job/68737472?type=standout#sol=8b6c3b2377e30b2b82e582f5ce601196aeae06e5  Wow. There's a research-teaching-practice job (not)!  Training the next generation (not!) What a f*cking scummy hoax of a f*cking scummy scam.  How much Quigley gets paid again?  So he can write 'research papers' on how he's 'morally grey' (to morally blind)?  What a f*cking joke.  </p>

                            <p>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/politics/pm-hipkins-says-china-nz-relationship-requires-careful-management/UYJB2XREAFAAZCLWAKDDVFBEJ4/  Uh... NZ *does not work*.   Mate.  NZ:  IT'S NOT WORKING.  You know how you know when it's working?  THEY PAY YOU.  THEY PAY YOU.  THEY PAY YOU.  WHERE ARE MY WAGES?  NZ:  IT'S NOT WORKING.  WHERE IS THE MONEY, EH????  </p>

                            <p>What happened to 'pay restraint' for people on more than $100,000 per year.  Because of how people are really doing it hard with the cost of living increase.  The price of fruit and veges etc.  People are really doing things hard, right now.  So there is supposed to be 'pay restraint' for people earning over $100,000 per year.  So...  Look at all the f*cking paid employment positions that are being advertised, right now, more than $100,000 per year.  Mostly fixed term positions of 6 months to 1 year only (to get past the next election only).  Positions paying couple hundred thousand dollars per year.  To get past the next election only.   NZ:  It's not working.  You f*cking psychopath.  Where is our elected leader?  Oh, she's been taken into US custody.  So we can choose between you and 'Come on barbie let's go party' (I guess National pissed off Hollywood so they threw you a past release for free).  There is no alternative.  There isn't anything here...  No hint of 'try'.</p>

Talk to us about the infectious disease protocols that you follow.  Also:  Who was the medical illustrator who illustrated your earlier 'opinion pieces' on how face masks were able to reduce the amount of virus passing through a semi-permeable membrane.  You did not illustrate the utility of face-masks yourself.  Correct?  You had a medical illustrator illustrate that for you.  I am wondering who they were.  They did a really great job of the illustrations.  Don't you think? </p>

                            <p>So... Do the students who work in your infectious disease laboratory have N95 face masks that are fit tested, yet?  I am curious...</p>

                                What is the point of this?
                            </p>

                            <p>Why don't we have NZ trained psychiatrists?</p>

                            <p>I suppose the idea is...  Who, in the Northern Hemisphere, wants to move all the way to NZ?  What are they trying to run away from?  Are they about to be prosecuted for raping their patients or...</p>

                            <p>I suppose it would be easier, then, for people to write them glowing references to help them move to NZ.  That way they won't have to bother with the expense of a trial and possible expense of keeping them imprisoned etc etc.  Else, maybe NZ is actually really rather more overt only considering applications from people who are pretty upfront about them needing to move on since their patients are being more and more vocal about crimes against them.  Like how Dr Leeks was a really desirable hire for Melborne precisely because of all the complaints that his victims were making about him.  That was what made him such a truly desirable hire for Melbourne.  Wasn't it?  The Royal Australasian College of Psychiatrists thought that it would be a good idea to move him someplace else (some place typically thought to be highly desirable - Melbourne) to better enable and facilitate his continued and ongoing crimes against patients.</p>

                            <p>So, now we understand what it is that they seem to most value...  We can think a  bit more about this advertisement...</p>

                            <p>I suppose they want someone, really, who isn't registered.  Who hasn't completed their training etc.  That way they can get them paying and paying and paying the 'University' of Otago.  Then they can be supervised by Professor Glue and he can check that they are on board with his practices of drugging the (particularly young female) patients with ketamine (a known date rape drug) and so on, in the name of 'treatment'.  Whatever drugs are easy and cheap.  Sourced from vet science, even.  Check that the new hire (who pays and pays and pays the 'University') is on board with the communal sleeping practices that are thought to be culturally normal or desirable, or whatever.  Training the boys to be girls to be boys in the name of equity...  All this 'revoluntary' treatment that NZ is involved in.  Auckland 'University' getting permission to manufacture LSD to give that to the people with anxiety or depression, now.  To keep them involutarily detained in conditions the UN inspectors would likely say constitute torture for their psychosis, now... The lack of medical records.  The lack of prescription records.  THe unlawful druggings...  It's hard to find people to payroll for psychiatry in NZ.  Do you wonder why?</p>

                            <p>1 FTE position is supposed to be shared between 3 people, I'm pretty sure that is how that is supposed to go.  1/3rd the time doing research, 1/3rd the time teaching the next lot, 1/3rd the time doing clinical practice.  But I suppose the idea is to 'divide and conquer' because it's soooooooooo competitive.  The present head of psychiatry at Auckland was recruited in this manner to do a PhD in neuroscience with PRofessor Glue -- correct?  He came from overseas...  And he worked in obgyn over there.  Correct?  Quite the change..  From obgyn to doing a PhD with Professor Glue to then be appointed head of the secure ward at Auckland city hospital when Auckland is manufacturing LSD and not keeping medication charts.  What a scummy scam.  Hoax.  What hospital?  What University?  What a f*cking farce.</p>

                            <p>Of course what it is really about, I would imagine, is not the medication that knocks people out.  It's the medication that makes them forget.  People don't remember what happened to them when they had surgery.  Right?  They don't remember the crimes that the government committed against them.  All those abuse survivors of state care...  If only they had have been drugged properly so that they never would say anything about what happened (the behaviorist intervention) or they would believe they asked for it to happen they wanted it (the cognitive intervention) or they don't even remember (medication).  Medication is best, clearly.  Nobody remembers the government of NZ doing anything wrong.  Nobdoy remembers the laws or the function of laws.  What are various people on payroll for?  Nobody remembers...  Must be something in the water, I guess...  </p>

                            <p>Inhumane.  What people?  There aren't any people,  here...</p>

                            <p>It's sooooooo competitive!  It's soooooooo competitive!!!! It's suuuuuuch a competitive and hostile environment!!!!  There's really nothing there.</p>

                            <p>The 'psychiatrists' are kept busy with all the people the court orders to be detained in the name of psychiatry to be placed in psychiatry institutions rather than prisons.  WHy?  So they can have electric shock treatment and have their 'nasal polyps' (so to speak) removed (suction to the frontal lobes, I suppose) and LSD and ketamine, now.  The government employees are giving them, in the name of 'treatment', I suppose.  Sign the prisoners up, those held under the mental health act, sign them up for the experimetal trials?  Is this how we do?  'Psychiatry' is too busy 'treating' the involuntary non-voluntary those detained against their will. What people do you see?  What people?  Inhumane institution of abuse.  Only.  How is this medicine?  But then...  How is medicine medicine.  I mean to say how is there any health system in NZ, at all?  The nasal polyp surgery isn't for the psych patients, specifically.  The radiation treatment in the name of cancer care etc.  Helping me helping me helping me help myself to you.  It's soooooo competitive!!!! It's sooooo competitive that Auckland cant' even / wont' even calcualte a GPA and process an application according to published selection algorithm.</p>

                            <p>Apparently it is sooooooo competitive that Auckland and Otago get around 3x as many applications as there are available places.  That's not as competitive as the US where they might get 8x as many.  But, then, the US encourages people to apply for 8 places in order to get 1.  So they artificially inflate their numbers.  Suppose that it really is that competitive, to do Medicine, in NZ.  They get 3x as many applications as there are available places.  So...  If you apply 3x you might well get a place -- right?  How about if you apply 6x?  At what point do you start to wonder...  What if your full time GPA is 8.6 and you apply multiple times to a programme that is supposed to be selecting on the basis of 'academic merit' primarily?  What then?  Oh, but maybe the problem is the lack of social skills...  But nobody said there was any problem with lack of 'social skills' when one was an English or Psychology major... So that doesn't seem to be the problem...  What is the problem?  Gee... I wonder what the problem is...  </p>

                            <p>Medicine's response or reaction to the Cartwright Inquiry was that Dr Green was unlucky that they chose to go after him because what he was doing wasn't any different or worse than what anybody else was doing and what anybody else was still doing.  That was the response from those employed in Science and Medicine in NZ.  That is what they overtly teach their studnets.  How do I know?  Because I did more undergraduate level pathology etc in NZ Universities and I got the message loud and clear.</p>

                            <p>What health system?</p>

                            The writing page contains a variety of writing samples where I am the first, or only author.  The samples range from fairly tightly written technical pieces in philosophy and psychology to longer explorations or investigations where the role of the philosopher is supposed to be the 'critic and conscience of society'.  You will find samples of my undergrad and honors research and coursework.  A MA thesis, MPhil thesis, PhD thesis.  A co-authored book chapter.

                            <p>
                            The seminars page contains more than a dozen seminars that were presented to departmental seminars or international conferences.  I have provided the written version of the talk and powerpoint presentation for the majority of them.  </p>

                            <p>The teaching page provides a list of courses I have taught and the subject contents that I was sub-contracted to develop to help the students understand the contents of a texbook that I was told to teach from.</p>

                            <p>The judicial review page provides a list of legal proceedings that I have filed with various courts of New Zealand.  Presently, the Social Security Appeals Authority is required to pass judgment on whether or not the Ministry of Social Development's decision to refuse to provide advance benefit payment for security for costs set by court of appeal on grounds that 'Justice is not an essential need' is to be upheld or to be overturned.  There was a substantive hearing of this matter in September of 2022 and judgment is awaited.</p>

                            <p>Neil Quigley instructed me to complain to the Office of the Ombudsman and then take the University to Court if I was unhappy with how the University of Waikato handled my enrolment etc in 2018-2019.  I was very unhappy with them (1) refusing to enrol me in the programme I applied to (2) recording I  had been enrolled in programmes I never applied to.  (3)  Refusing to get a thesis that I submitted for examination out to external examiners so as to prevent them accepting it.  (4)  Sending a thesis I submitted for MPhil examination out for 'doctoral reports' to be written (sending it out to be examined for the wrong degree).  (5)  Refusing to base the outcome of external examination on the reports of external examiners.  How could any of this be considered acceptable?  Justice Toogood was reappointed from his retirement to write reports on the untimely deaths of Mason Pendrous and Olivia Podmore.  Both of whom died in state care (care of the Univeristy of Canterbury and Cycling NZ, respectively).  He was also given his day in court hearing Roe v University of Waikato legal proceedings. </p>

                            <p>The University of Auckland advised me that I needed to have completed a qualification within the last 5 years to be 'eligible' to study MBChB.  That was why I applied to do a 120 point MPhil with Waikato in 2018 and that was why I handed them a 50,000 word MPhil Thesis on September 14 of 2018.  Waikato refused to get that thesis out to externals.  They are not functioning as a University, at all.  It turns out that the Education and Training Act states that domestic adults are eligible to be  enrolled in the programme they applied to.  I applied to MBChB and I am a domestic adult who is over 20.  I mean to say that the statutory law of NZ says that I am eligible.  The Univesrity of Auckland had no right to throw my application away on grounds that they deemed me 'ineligible'.  They were required to process my application same as everybody else.  Enter my GPA, UMAT / UCAT score, interview score into their algorithm and offer me a place or not on the  basis of my rank order score.  Firstly, they entered incorrect information into my GPA field to try and tell me that my GPA wasn't good enough.  Then they simply refused to enter my GPA at all.  Apparently they just pick and choose whoever they want for whatever arbitrary reasons they want.  How is that working out for NZ?  Dr Leeks.  He wasn't picked becuase his rank order score was high enough.  He was picked on personal grounds for all the qualities they value.  Dr  Green (the pathologist who watched Maaori die without intervention).  Professor Glue.  All these people hand picked for all the qualities they value for Medical Doctors, in NZ.  Hand picked.  Exceptional.  Exceptions.  Each and every one of them.  It's all very very very very very very personal. </p>

                            <p> New Zealand does not seem to have a functioning tertiary education system.  The 'Universities' are not processing applications to enrol.  They are not acknowledging progression through training programmes.  They are not graduating people who have done the work for their degrees.  I am trying to remember whether ANY of the students at the Australian National University actually had their work go out for external examination at all, or whether the University simply decided that they had done enough for their degrees.  The Australian National University kept Carl Brusse re re re enrolled for more than 10 years as a doctoral student.  Correct?  How many times over did he write doctoral theses for the Australian National University while they only take more and more and more money from the government for keeping him re re re re enrolled.  So that his supposed 'supervisors' can be paid hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of base salary and research funding.  While they refuse to do the supervision job for which they are paid (where is the evidence of my being supervised?  Evidence of meetings?  Evidence of written comments on my written work?)   What education and training system?</p>

                            <p>Sterelny was paid how much each and every year to supervise graduate research studnets?  How much money was he paid?  He had no teaching work at all.  All he had to do was supervise students and do research work of his own.  Here is an idea...  Be editor of a journal so everybody sends their work to you.  Then you can reattribute authorship of it.  F*cking psychopath.  Where is evidence of your supervising me?  How much money were you paid to supervise me?  WHere is evidence of you doing the job for which you were f*cking well paid?  Psychopath.  It's soooooooo competitive!  IT's suuuuuch a hoooostile environment and I'm a f*cking selfish prick.  F*cking arsehole.  Oooooh soooooo motivating and inspiring.  IN f*ckign retard-land.  Psychopath.  Had one job to do.</p>

                            <p>Where does all the money go?  Half a million for Una Jagose.  Half a million for Ashley.  Each and every year.  Quarter of a million for Chris Whelan to take complaints he receives about the Universities of NZ and throw them away (to ensure his statutory function is not filled by him, is not filled by anybody at all).  Is Geoffrey Palmer still on government payroll?  How about his son?  They are both of them over the age of 65, aren't they?  The Judge who makes his career proclaiming and pronouncing judicial review of administrative action to be without teeth and removal from office (a remedy listed in the HIgh Court Rules) to be obsolte.  That's what obsolete meeeeeeeans.  To be listed in the laws of NZ.  All of the laws are obsolete, I suppose, since the NZ judiciary seems carefully exceptionally  hand-picked all chosen specially for the reason that they are unwilling and or unable to even parse the laws.  Lacking in the most basic reading comprehension.  </p>

                            <p>Everyone is supposed to say that they would leave NZ for Australia if they could.  Why?  Because Australia pays their workers higher wages.  So people can get on with living instead of constantly cry cry cry cry crying about how they don't have enough money to have their basic needs met.  Cry cry cry cry cry cry crying about how their basic needs aren't met.  It isn't about the money...  It is about withholding money being used as a tool or mechanism of bullying and abuse.  That's the problem, really.  Gaslighting.  It's not cold.  There must be something wrong with you.  Etc.  Intentionally withhholding for bullying and abuse.  That's basically the thing of it.  How badly do you have to treat people in NZ so that they will say 'of course we would rather move to Australia because NZ is just kept as a detention prison camp land and they don't pay their workers.  They don't pay their workers.  Half a million for Ashley.  Half a million for Una.  They don't pay their workers.  All these people over 65 who have paid off their mortgage on their modest family home they aren't supposed to be on payroll at all.  All the money for  them.  All the money for them.  All the money for them to enable their ongoing crimes.  All the money for them.  All the money for them.  All the money for them to keep endentured servants or slaves'.  F*cking psychopath land.  Will not have things any other way.</p>

                            <p>What is the hope for Australia, then?  Well, they chose to move Harlene Hayes from Otago to Western Australia after she refused to graduate around 1/3rd the medical students so as to get more and more and more money for the University by re re re enrolling them in the qualification.  So how are things in Western Australia, then?  On track for the 'how low can we go' game.  They chose to move Kim Sterelny from Victoria University Wellington (wellington wellington wells) to The Australian National University.  So that he could withhold graduations and keep studnets re re re re re enrolled with the Australian National University.  What evidence is there of him supervising his studnets to timely completion?  What evidence is there of him helping me with my thesis?  Any comments from him?  How about him simply passing it on to external examiners with a note from him saying he was too lazy or too much of a psychopath or whatever he thinks the problem was that he didn't help me with my thesis...  Let the externals work with me to get it done, then.  F*cking psychopath.  It's sooooo competitive.  Is he still on payroll?  How old is he?  How much in over-payments has he received already?  F*cking psychopath.  Yeah, Australia is really a destination...  How low can they go, hey?  Aspiring to new lows.  Obviously and clearly.</p>

                            <p>Dr Leeks for Melbourne.  Melbourne's really a destination place when Dr Leeks was considered the best hire they could do for Psychiatry.  </p>

                            <p>Not even trying to be fair.</p>

                            <p>Apparently it was Australian Payroll Systems that would not pay the NZ teachers.  Would not accept that they had graduated from their teacher training qualifications.  Refused to pay them.  This was near the start of labors first term (they are in their second term now).  Would not pay the teachers.</p>

                            <p>Why?  The 'teachers' were supposed to move to Australia and work in the child detention camps over there.  That was what Australia thought they would be good for.  Those were the paid positions in the vicinity.  Right?  Australia's version of Oraka Tamariki.  But they would  be paid because it was Australia.</p>

                            <p>The 'nursing' positions in Australia.  The detention camps for young people. For elderly people.  Government institutions of abuse.  Those.  Detention camps.  For the 'nurses' of NZ.  When NZ refuses to acknoweldge they have graduated.  When they want money.  Australia says they will pay them to work as unskilled unqualfied 'nurses' in the detention camps over there.</p>

                            <p>Then, in 15 years, they will round them all up and pop them into nuclear submarines and drown them in the Ocean.  Then blame Japan for nuclear contamination of the oceans.  Is that the plan?</p>

                            <p>Western Australia seems to want lists, now.  Lists of able bodies people to express an interest in 'working' in Western Australia.  Volunteers.  I wonder who will express an interest in volunteering to move to Western Australia after the most illustrious of Vice Chancellor's (Harlene Hayes) was trafficked (or something)  over there...  Really motivating and inspiring, she was.  Her leadership style.  All trained in Organisational Psychology for re structuring things around getting people re re re re applying for their old job (plus more duties) for less and less and less pay.  Oh,  but only those kept most poorly.  F*cking psychopath.</p>

                            <p>Why move to Australisia?  The people!  The people!  The people!  Who wouldn't want to bully and abuse and so on!  It's all about getting to bully and abuse the people!  The people!  The people!  What people?  There doesn't really seem to be anything left...  Maybe that's a function of not being paid a living wage...  Mooore money for the Vice Chancellors!  Pay rise for Quigley!  MOre and more money for keeping more and more graduate studnets re re re re re enrolled in qualifications they never applied to be enrolled in!  MOre money for Justice Toogood!   HOw old is Justice Toogood?  What is the retirement age for Judges?  How  much was Justice Toogood overpaid and who was supposed to have Judged Roe v University of Waikato?  NZ does not have a functioning Judiciary.  Australian Federal Court does not function.  They will not accept jurisdiction of NZ when it is in the Australian Constitution that NZ is the second named state of Australia.  They won't supply birth certificates and passports to NZers.  They won't pay NZ governmetn workers Australiain wages.</p>

                            <p>HOW IS IT SUPPOSED TO GO??</p>

                            <p>Suppose you pay me to teach students.  To teach them nursing or medicine or whatever.  Okay...  So suppose you only pay me to teach them.  I have a full time teaching workload.  That is what I am supposed to do.  Teach them.  You don't pay me to do research (you don't give me protected time in which to do research) you don't pay me to do clinical practice (you don't give me protected tim in which to do clinical practice.  I have one job to do:  Teach them.</p>

                            <p>Alright then.  What am I supposed to teach them?  I don't know...  Maybe I have time to do preparation for my teaching.  Maybe I do.  I don't know how many hours I'm expected to actually spend in front of the students.  The rest of the hours can be spent preparing for class and / or grading or examining them or their work, I suppose.  But what is the curriculum, then?  What are we supposed to teach them?  Or are we simply a detention camp facility.  Keeping teh studnets bums on the seats for however many hours.  They pay the 'university' or 'training college' or whatever for being 'students' for howevever many years... Ooooh and maybe they get lucky and graduate into teaching positions of their own.</p>

                            <p>My understanding was that 1/3rd the time was supposed to be spent teaching, 1/3rd research, 1/3rd clinical practice.  Why?</p>

                            <p>What are we teaching?  We can teach what we are researching.  What we are researching is preparation time, in a sense...  We can teach our research -- but that is a bit frought.  In particuar people are not very good at hearing or engaging in or with criticism from or by their peers...  Subjecting students to it can be even more frought...  But we can certainly teach them the things that we have been researching...</p>

                            <p>We can also say 'hey, a patient came in yesterday (suitably anonymous) and presented with these symptoms..  How would you proceed?  We can teach on the basis of our clinical experience.  Teaching cases that are actually coming in.  In real time.  SOmeone in the class may say 'hey, what about this?' and we can actually go.  Oh...  Yeah...  Maybe.  We never thought of that...  And that could actually factor in to better healthcare for the patient.</p>

                            <p>But this assumes we are actually trying to help people.  Die!  Die!!! Die!!! So that I can be only person on payroll at age of 85..  All y'all can die!  Die!! Die!!! It's soooooooooooo competitive.  PS don't forget to pay the 'university'.</p>

                            <p>Oh my... So now we have 3 psychiatrists (for example) for 1 FTE (where we only had 1 before).  What does that mean?  Well...  I heard something about...  1 person actually in the hospital.  1 person on call for a consult.  So the person in the hospital can obtain a second opinion from a peer.  Suitably knowledgeable other.  Another person is not on call.  Is doing what they need to do to look after themself.  Look after their basic needs.  SO they can rotate into postion in due course.</p>

                            <p>But no  no no no no no no there simply can't be 3 psychiatrists sharing 1 FTE.  It's sooooooooooo competitive.  Clearly teh aim of the game is to eliminate the competition and get paid 3xFTE all for oneself...  I can be 1FTE teaching and 1FTE research and 1FTE clinical practice.  Also 1FTE as judge 1FTE as jury and 1FTE as executioner.  I can old 1FTE portfolio and another 1FTE portfolio.  I can be minister of everything and all things to all men!!!! I can have millions and millions of dollars of income for myself when I never studied finance or anything and I have no knowledge or abiltity to share that money around..  </p>

                            <p>Regarding the court of appeal...  My understanding is that the grounds for appeal are (1) matters of fact and (2) matters of law.  Regarding matters of fact, if the substantive judgment relies on things that the judge accepted as fact that are not fact.  I mean to say, the judge makes false assertions of fact to support their judgment or as reason for their judgment.  I mean to say if the judge says they were supplied with evidence for x - but they were not.  Or the judge says they were not supplied with evidence for y - but they were.  So I can pull out the document (or the court of appeal will not be able to pull out the document).  I have evidence that the University of Waikato recorded me being enrolled in programmes I never applied to.  That is a simple matter of fact.  I can supply the application to enrol that they acknowledged they received.  I can supply the enrolment records they lodged with the IRD.  ffs.  It's really not that hard.  Regarding the laws that's a simple matter of reading comprehension of the statutes.  But the courts don't seem to be even trying to be fair, at all.  How it is not a matter of public interest that NZ Universities are not properly processing applications to enrol, progressions through training, graduations is beyond me.  It's supposed to be how much money for the economy?  International studnets?  Sent home without their degrees.  Over-billed for their degrees.  It's all very very very personal and very very very particular, they say.  Nobody else has ever had a complaint accepted as being received.  It's all very very very particular very very personal problems between the  many studnets who complain to Chris Whelan (head of NZVCC) every freaking year and their supervisors and the Universities who get more and more and more and more money for re re re re re enrolling studnets in considerable excess of what was required for their degrees.  It's a scummy hoax of a scummy scam.</p>

                            <p>Apparently Chris Hipkins studied criminology at Victoria University of Wellington wellington wellington wells.  So he would know full well about how when you don't pay the teachers and you remove the curriculum contents then you are heading down a trajectory of more and more violent crime.  That was the ideal?  Was that the whole ideal behind not paying the teachers?  You are seeing that produce dividends, now.  Instead of paying teachers you can pay prison guards and prison wardens.  Just remove the foetus' early and put it in the prison camp.  What do you have to do to it so that it will do all of the work (it gets the food and it hands it over) for low to no pay. Was that the great idea for NZ?  And then what, Chris.  You and your cronies would simply have taken enough money out to take your money and flee to....  Where?  Where would you go?  And why would they have you when you ruined here?  WHy not make here in to a place where people might actually choose to want to be?  Instead of aiming to be a place where people are only because they can't get away.  F*cking psychopaths.</p>

                            <p>I liked Fiction.  Learning about the human condition, or people.  Other points of view.  Other perspectives.  What it may have been like for someone to experience this and that.  Vicarious experience.  What it was like for at least one soldier in the war.  What it was like for at least one girl raised in this or that circumstance etc.  But I became concerned, then, about psychological plausibility.  How much fictional characters or characters described in fiction were psychologically plausible or realistic, or something.  Constaints on human psychology.  So I became interested in psychology, then.  Also overlap.  My first year of University I was obsessed (in my own time) with Camus and Sartre.  Theatre of the Absurd.  Not so much their philosophy -- but their literature.  Plays plays plays plays plays plays plays.  Marlow...  Faust.  I suppose somewhat fueled by studying Beckett etc.  T.S. Elliot.  I remember Marshal Walker (English Professor at Waikato, from the US) got the entire class on their feet singing 'I would walk 500 miles'...  I found some books of his in the second hand book shop.  Annotated.  His notes in the margins.  I discovered John Barth in that way.  The End of the Road and the Floating Opera.  Letters.  Giles, Goat Boy.  </p>

                            <p>I was also influenced very very much by Stephen King.  I was an avid reader.  The Regulators and the other one...  Published at the same time.  My first year of University.  The Dark Half.  The whole 'Stephen King' and 'Richard Bachman' thing...  Was what got me interested in the notion of multiple personality.</p>

                            <p>There is all the difference in the world between a victim of abuse saying 'I don't remember' and the persecutor standing up before the judge saying 'I don't remember' 'wasn't me' 'can't have been me'.  Can you hear the difference?  If you can't I don't think my explaining will help you.</p>

THe Medical graduates of Harvard got to listen to Jacinda (no prosecution for wrongful death of a foetus and now abortion is legalised come hither for all your experimentation on the unborn child needs -- we also have highest rates of infanticide and child abuse if you have an entire trajectory planned)...</p>
