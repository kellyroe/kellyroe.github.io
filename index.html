                            <p>
                            The Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand defines the enrolment period (amount of work) that is associated with New Zealand University Qualifications.  They define a 120 point program of study as being comprised of 34 weeks of work (including the examination period).  Here is the evidence for this:  <a href="judicial-review/TEC-34-weeks.pdf" target="_self"> Enrolment Periods </a> 
                            </p>

                           <p>Australasian Universities believe they are entitled to simply refuse to process or progress students work, however.  Take it to court, they say.  Then the courts refuse to progress filings.   
                            </p>

                            <p>  
                            Here are my filings for Roe v Univerity of Otago with the Court of Appeal.

                            </p>


                            <p>  Here are some of my submissions to the Supreme Court regarding a few cases:  <a href="judicial-review/sc-myfiling.pdf" target="_self"> The Supreme Court. </a> The Supreme Court refused to accept these filings.  
                                </p> 

                            <p>
                            It seems to me that the Australian Constition explicitly states that New Zealand is regarded, by them, to be a State of the Federation of Australia: <a href="judicial-review/ec.pdf" target="_self"> Letter to Electoral Commission. </a>  Australia refuses to honor it's own Constitution. 
                            </p>

                            <p>So, apparently the idea is to race your way to PhD by the time you are 25.  Then you can be on pay-roll as 'doctor' of some variety.  That's 3 years undergrad, 1 year honors, 3 years PhD for a total of 7 years.  But it's extendible to 4 years and it takes 1 year to grade the thing (3 months examination, 6 months changes 3 months examination) and then another 10 weeks of changes hahahahaha.  Didn't make doctor before you turned 25 hahahahaha.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            And then there's all the 'terminal masters' for or of the people who didn't make it.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            This is the mentality.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Medicine is aiming for the top because it's a 6 year Degree.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The aim is to collect the doctors salary ASAP.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            What did you think?  It was about learning or something?  The school is a detention camp.  Clearly.  It's all about the money.  The money.  The money.  The money.  The money.  Except this is New Zealand so it's not about the money.  It's not really about the money.  The money is a symbol of other things, you see.  It's about the detention camp.  The keeping of slaves, indentured servants, volunteers...
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            You pay the University and they put you to work.  Delaying your paycheque.  You pay them and they put you to work.  Then, when it is time for them to pay you for the work that you do it is time for you to go away.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            There isn't any healthcare or education or whatever, here.  It's soooooooo competitive.  The detention camp of the world.  The ethics dump.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I didn't want to be the next Dr Leeks.  I don't think torturing people is fun.  I don't think that scamming people is fun.  I valued things like honesty and integrity.  Congrats.  you win.  Alllll of the money for you.  ALllllll of the titles for you.  Alllll of the things for you.  Try not to get sick becuase the vultures will swoop or swarm in.  I guess you know that.  Hey, take what you can for as long as you can because you can.  Right.  
                            </p>

                            The most under-productive economy in the world.  I'm an indentured servant only accumulating government debt (debt to the universities, debt to the court, debt to the government to pay my rent) for all of the work that I do.  The most under-productive economy in the world.

                            <p>Jacinda Ardern.  PhD in Law from Harvard, by popular opinion.  Apparently I haven't done enough for entry to Medical School.  Apparently I haven't done enough for entry to PhD (the ANU declined my application to start '22).  Apparently I haven't done enough to have completed a PhD.  Apparently I haven't done enough to be shoulder-tapped for a government job (the government is the major employer in New Zealand).  I am anti-valued.  Accumulate debt.  My net worth is in the negative.  According to the Government.  What it is that they value.  It's not that hard to see why I spend so much of my life wishing I had never been born.  Most certainly never been born, here.  Why did I want to help people?  Yeah.  Why the hell would I want to help people.  I mean...   Look at how they choose to keep and choose to value and choose to acknowledge me.  Apparently they just win the game of life.  The game I didn't know y'all were playing.  I loose because I didn't want to play your stupid f*cking race to the bottom.
