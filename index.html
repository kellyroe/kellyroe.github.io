                            <p>It is an election year so they aren't really hiring for anything or anyone who isn't helping them put a positive spin on things.  So things are more corrupt over this time than usual, even, I suppose.  Less freedom of speech etc because of the pretence of an election.  The politicians go into chewing each other's arms of mode.  It's soooooo competitive.</p>

                            <p>There was a lot of heat about corruption in the lead up to the last election.  People spending more than they were supposed to on campaigning.  Not disclosing donations properly etc.  Jacinda was payrolled by Harvard.  That's how they know that she was corrupt.  They were paying her specifically to be on the take for them.  I mean, they announced as much.  When they said they were giving her a pot of money.  To the value of a couple hundred thousand US dollars.  She announced that the money was going to be converted into a 2 year Master of Leadership in the Kennedy School for a New Zealander.  Who was the New Zealander who got to do that?  Where did the money go?</p>

                            <p>Are we supposed to believe that that is what she is doing now?  Writing her memoirs on her cellphone from a room she shares with another student?  I'm trying to understand...  Anyway, when she accepted the award people asked her about people overspending during their campaigning and she said that everybody did it.  That you wouldn't get into parliament if you didn't do that.  So, then, the lot of them need to get out, you see.  Because they cheated.  That was what she was saying.  What democracy?</p>

                            <p>There is a nasty aspect to the USA whereby they think they are  better somehow if they make other people look bad.  So something a bit gloaty about pointing out how corrupt things are in NZ.  Their role in ensuring that things are corrupt in NZ.  Something like that I guess.  Something about how if one person chooses to hire a prostitute it is the prostitute who is in the wrong.  Not the person going around choosing to do that with their money.  That kind of an aspect or element to it.  Like the people who think they are helping prevent child porn by spending all their time searching for it and downloading it etc etc.  Sometimes even on government payroll to do that all day.  Payrolling the biggest offenders.  </p>

                            <p>The US housing collapse was however long ago so of course people invested accordingly in NZ knowing that it would happen here, eventually.  So... What is next for NZ.  Since we are forced to follow along however many years behind...</p>

                            <p>What is the problem in the US right now?  Well, people who are 65 are not retiring.  They are saying that since the economy took a turn they won't have as much saved as they wanted else the cost of living means they won't have as much saved as they wanted.  So they aren't going to retire at 65, they are going to keep their pay packets.  So there aren't jobs, then, for younger people.  Because they won't stop paying the people who are 65 and over.  The government jobs is what I am focusing on, here.  The government jobs.  THe federal and state government jobs.  They won't stop payrolling them.  So there aren't positions for anybody else. The bottleneck.  They won't stop paying them.</p>

                            <p>I don't know what to say about the private sector.  It is different.  But these cushy government jobs.  People get one at around the age of 20 and have them for 45 years and they are supposed to retire from them at the age of 65.  Get out.  Being elected representative is different...  Expecting generations of people to just off and die because there aren't jobs for them because these other greedy f*cking grubs won't get out.</p>

                            <p>How old was the speaker of the house sent off to be diplomat to Ireleand (clearly nobody else wanted that job)?  How old is Kim Sterelny?  Still on payroll is he?  And his wife, too?  How many studnets theses they sending out for external examination, these days?  Any of them at all?  When was the last time they sent a studnets thesis out for external examination, actually?  Not even trying to be fair at all.</p>
