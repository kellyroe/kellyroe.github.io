                            <article>

                                <p>
                                I think about what a 'reasonable and solvent' person would think upon viewing the evidence that I have supplied to the courts, reading the relevant laws as written, and reading the Judgments that have been delivered by the courts over the last year.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I do not think that a 'reasonable and solvent' person would choose to do business in this jurisdiction, given how the Judges have refused to accept the evidence and refused to uphold the laws.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Australia has problems of the 'underarm bowl' variety where they have trouble with the laws as written and principles of natural justice or fairness.  But what is going on in New Zealand is different.  Garbage output.
                                </p>
                                 
                                <p>
                                Once upon a time the Australian National University had a 'reciprocal' relationship with the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.  The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill offered 1 year of PhD (graduate living stipend) to an ANU Philosophy student.  The student was to teach 1 class per semester (comparable to the teaching requirements of their enrolled students) and was able to audit (for non-credit) graduate level classes or courses.  It gave an extra year of funding, teaching experience, and education (graduate level coursework that does not exist outside the US system) to an Australasian student.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                So the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, offered 1 year of funding an ANU student.  They did this for several students, over the course of several years.  But the US economy was not doing so well.  The year I was there people on pay-roll over some amount agreed to take a pay-hit so that they wouldn't be forced to lay off any permanent staff.  It was pointed out to me that they were thinking about (and they subsequently did) stop investing in an Australasian student because that was money that they needed to spend on supporting their own students.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                What did the Australian National University offer the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, in return for their investment?   It is material that at this time the Australian economy was doing (comparatively) very very well.  It overtook the Canadian Dollar!! 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The University of North Carolina sent a few students (not at Australian expense) on trips to Australia so that they could meet people in the Department and stay for a time (not at Australian expense). Showcase themselves and their work.  I believe that quite a few students from North Carolina were applying for post-doctoral fellowship positions etc.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                They were smart students who were doing good work.  Personable and good students.  You might think that in the interests of justice or fairness that the Australian National University could have seen fit to fund even one student from North Carolina to provide them some kind of return on their investment.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                To the best of my knowledge, the University of North Carolina got nothing out of Australia or the Australian National University as the result of their investment in a succession of students who were enrolled in the Australian National University.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                What was particularly appalling to my mind, however, was that one of the students was treated as an object of public ridicule.  She was fed a succession of alcohol at a party and socially pressured into keeping up and she became quite ill and physically sick and she was mocked relentlessly for throwing up in the house of someone very senior who she was trying to impress.  It was all very...  Distasteful.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I think the University of North Carolina ended up withdrawing their investment in the Australian National University because the Australian National University chose to take advantage of them while (for example) proritising sending students to the Hauser Lab of Harvard.  Thinking that the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill was beneath them, somehow, because the premier University of Australia is comparable to the premier University of America, clearly (even when you look at the state of the IT and science and arts and culture and there fairly obviously and clearly is no direct comparison).
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                It was, apparently, so very sad that they chose to make an example of Mark Hauser because he wasn't doing anything differently from how everybody else does their labs -- right?  Not any differently from how anybody does anything in Australasia.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                This is why I choose to pay it forwards (insofar as I have the power to do that) to North Carolina and not to Australia.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Australia did not invest in me.  They thought they could exploit me.  They enrolled me into their PhD programme and provided little to no supervision at all.  They delayed every milestone (6 monthly review, mid-term review) and expected me to do things like house-sit for my supervisor.  I understand my supervisor thought I was garbage -- because he thought he could get away with treating me like garbage.  I don't suppose that either of us did have any respect for each other, at the end of the day.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I returned to New Zealand because I wanted to study Medicine.  I invested in many years of being a student in New Zealand because I thought my investment would pay off.  I offered free tutoring to under-privaledged kids to help them pass their physiology examinations at Weltec.  I was not a snob.  I was humble.  I shut my mouth and listened to other people teach and speak for many years.  In return I was failed out of qualifications (I wasn't going to be seeking employment from the qualification therefore they were entitled to refuse to give me credit for the qualification -- right?)    
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                New Zealand Universities think that I am intellectually handicapped, retarded in the head, and / or incredibly stupid for having invested my time and money (in the form of student loan investment) in them.  I was being humble and working playing the long game and they were simply thinking I was stupid and taking advantage.  Things have gotten to the point where they will involuntarily detain me in the hospital saying I'm mentally ill force-feeding me medication they did not chart and then sending me a hospital bill.  It is just garbage garbage garbage output from New Zealand.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I could have rushed through my 3 year PhD immediately after my Honors year and then laid flat and I likely would have (because I wouldn't have been very competent) a tenured position from a NZ University.  I could have saved from my income towards college in the US and likely be looking at being able to pay my way through a private college 4 year Degree followed by Medical School about now. I chose to be humble and not rush through a PhD and get signed off on one on the basis of my supervisor writing it for me (over 5 or 10 years).  New Zealand has chosen to take me for a fool.  Apparently I made the stupid wrong decision so I lose everything.  That's the game they want to play, in New Zealand.  There is no such thing as fair returns.  Only people taking advantage of other people and unfairness all around.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                And then they get sick and the Hitler Youth immobilise them with medication and ventillate them to force the common-cold down deep into their lungs.  Ventillate them so they induce inflammation and really get that infection growing until they drown in their lung secretions.  I guess nobody saw it coming.  Cheapest doctors ever.  They pay the University in exhange for doing whatever they want with impunity -- right?
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Nobody in their right mind would invest in here.  I see that, now.  That is the result of the choices that they made.  The qualifications are worth nothing.  They don't even mean anything anymore as they give them to people who pay them, they pay them, they pay them, they pay them, they pay them.  I don't think there's been a graduation conferral even since about 2018.  Maybe before then, even.  We don't have a health system, an education system, a justice system, at all.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Who will help me make antigen tests?  Who will graduate the students who have the capacity to help make the antigen tests?  Who will pay the people to make antigen tests?  The New Zealand Government won't.  It just expects to take them.  Nobody in their right mind would attempt to do business with New Zealand.  There's nobody home.  There's nothing here.  Take a look at the Judgments and you will see.  When they refuse to honor their contracts etc there will be no justice in the NZ jurisdiction.  It's just an off-shore detention camp of Australia is all.  There's nothing here.
