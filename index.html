 <!--<h2>Hello World!</h2> !-->
                        <div class="container">

                            <p>What do you want, Chris Whelan?  International Students to demonstrate they have enough money to give to NZ so they can study here for 3x or 4x or 5x or is it 20x the length of their proposed course of study before they are given a visa into the country?  What do you think is fair?  Our qualifications should cost 3x 4x 9x as much as those in the US and so on -- after you've taken into account the corruption of NZ choosing to employ the likes of you...</p>

                            <p>It's sooooooo competitive to get student hostages to come here where their parents will keep paying and keep paying and keep paying and keep paying some kind of ransom so that their kids don't get sent home defiled.  Raped in the residential halls.  Imprisoned in the psychiatric institutions.  No references from their supervisors.  THeir work never having been examined for the qualifications they were enrolled in.  It's sooooooo competitive to get the studnets whose parents will pay and pay and pay and pay and pay...  SOooooo competitive, right Chris?  Sooooooo competitive...</p>

                            <p> https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/300880598/dawn-raids-on-pause-as-government-reviews-outofhours-immigration-visits  Dawn Raids will resume in June.   Back to business as usual, in June, then.  That's what 'sorry' means, you see.  It means 'I'm sorry to hear that you feel that way awwwww...  And of course we will keep on doing all of the things that made you feel that way so we can continue to be oh so very very sorry for the way that you feel.  Awwww.....' </p>

                            <p>The 'vocational education market'.  So, apparently they refuse to graduate around 1/2 or 50 per cent of the nurses.  What does that mean, exactly?  Do you mean that the Universities are double billing for them all?  Forcing them to do 2x the unpaid internships?  Forcing them to work as unqualified 'healthcare assistants' for minimum wage (if they are even getting wages for that when they are required to do internships in order to have any chance of graduating at all.  Just one more internship.  Hey, just another internship.  Hey, we won't acknowledge the last one that you did, the sign off wasn't acknowledged.  The pedophile on payroll threatened to tell everyone that it was you who was a pedophile if you didn't go camping with him and housesit for him and doing all of his work for him for no pay...  Is that what you mean by our 'vocational education market working'?  THe keeping of slaves.  When it's time to pay them it's time for them to be deported or shipped off in the submarines.  Nothing to see here, people.  Justice Toogood doesn't want to retire so various other people will need to be shipped off to die so that he can keep his pay cheque for the next 40+++ years.  He doesn't see anything wrong with the workers being re re re re re re re enrolled in programmes of study they never applied to once they'd done enough for their qualification completion already.  He can't see anything wrong.  Only over his dead body, aye.</p>

                            <p>University of Canterbury can fire people for subcontracting out a lecture.  Lots of academics have done that, so that's a lot of potential firings.  I'm surprised that the court didn't say that they should have explained to her that she was not to do that and told her not to do it again.  Sent a memo out to all the university employees and tell them that they were not to subcontract their work or get their students doing their research and / or teaching work for them for less pay.  I would have thought that before you fired someone over something you were supposed to tell them that something was not acceptable and give them opportunity to remedey that.  But the courts of NZ have ruled that if you find that your employee has done something like that then you can fire them.  So, I wonder how many people will be fired from NZ 'Universities' now.</p>

                            <p>They fired someone who actually produced a research output of a sort.  A play.  Wrote a new play.  I would imagine or suppose that the rest of the English department would have been sooooooooooo jealous that one of the people in the department had produced a research output.  Soooooooooo jealous.  Oh my!  They would have got together for a right tongue wag!   The play would have been garbage garbage garbage rubbish rubbish would have been the verdict from all the unproductive frienemies.  Nasty.  Vindictive.  Spiteful.  Mean.  That's the way of universities when the lack of production of research output becomes the norm.  The most unproductive are often the meanest when it comes to undermining the outputs of others.  Because it's sooooooooo competitive.  </p>

                            <p>THey probably fired the most productive person in the English Department.  So they can get back, then, to business as usual, where they eye each other wariliy and call 'garbage garbage' until nobody outputs any work at all.  The race to the bottom.</p>

                            <p>It wasn't very nice of me to call my frienemies 'f*cking retards'.  But then, it was not very nice of them not to get my work out for external examination.  I'm trying to remember if I was ever nasty or mean or whatever about their work.  I'm wondering why they think it is acceptable for them to  be nasty about or over mine?  I see now that it was about my not applying for jobs that they were applying to so that they would be the only game in town.  I'm not surprised Kim Sterelny wanted to keep Rachel close -- wasn't Rachel's husband privately tutoring his daughter in math?  I guess Kim would have wanted to make sure that the got the school grades that she needed to do whatever he wanted her to be enrolled in in University.  That makes sense.  Why he would have been keen to have Rachel and Rachel's husband kept around.  Why didn't my work go out to externals Rachel?  How about your work..  Did your work ever go out to externals?  Did you get reports from external examiners who were independent enough from Sterelny and the production of your research for them to be independent?  I wonder because I remember Nick saying that his externals didn't have so much as a typographical alteration for him to make.  THey just accepted his thesis without any changes at all.  Which, more recently, I've thought is most likely to be the case when...   Why, when the Univesrity simply says that they sent it out to examiners and simply says that they didn't have any changes.  I mean to say...  Who externally examines a thesis and doesn't find so much as a sentance that can be restructured?  A single typo to be corrected?  Another reference to be added?  It just doesn't sound plausible to me at all that someone be paid however much to externally examine a thesis and then..  Not write examiners reports of that thesis, at all.  It sounds to me like it was not sent out for external examination.  They just gave him the Degree.</p>

                            <p>Nasty business.  Nasty business, indeed.  You are right Sterelny.  Australasia does not have an education and training system, at all.  There's nothing there.  It got overtaken by the likes of you.  F*cking psychopaths.  </p>

                            <p>Who does your house-sitting now, Kim?  Carl still doing that while he writes a PhD thesis 2x (or did you write his second one for him or reapprporiate it from someone else and have Carl pass that one off as his own else he would never never never be acknowledged as having done enough for a PhD)..  What happened to Carl's thesis on personal identity that he wrote in the first 3 years?  Someone from Princeton was credited as the author of it -- right?  So that you could bully Carl and try and have everyone believe he was slow and unproductive and a procrastinator etc etc while you refuse to accept that he'd done all of the work that he's done and you get him housesitting for you and you claim how much money over how many decades to keep Carl enrolled in the Univesrity?  F*cking psychopath.  </p>

                            <p>Overloading the graduate students with teaching work was a main way that the Universities have of bullying graduate students into taking more and more and more time to have their research work acknowledged.  The other main mechanism is telling them that they are garbage garbage garbage.  I wish, retrospectively, that I actually tape-recorded the supervision meetings that I had with Justine Kingsbury.  So that people could hear how she spoke to me.  The tone and manner that she used.  She would instruct me to make a change to my thesis that would make it more  her and less me and it was a change that I didn't want to make for various reasons.  Then I'd have to explain to her why I thought that the change she was suggesting would make the thesis worse and less likely to be accepted by externals than it was at present.  But  no.  She was determined I should change it in ways that were different from what the externals required.  And she was determined that she was the authority on what the externals meant in their comments to me and that I was to do what she said else I would be failed for the Degree.  While she insructs me to change in in ways the externals never asked for.  Doing everything she can to have me failed, herself.  Nasty nasty nasty.  Why?  Jealousy.  Spite.  Those kinds of things...  That seems to be it.  She has a tenured position on payroll as a philsophy academic.  I did everything I could to soothe her that I wasn't going to be applying for philosophy jobs.  I was going to get the thesis done and then go off and do something else.  Something that was different from what she wanted to do.  So I wasn't a direct competitor with her...  In fact, I was happy for us to get sections to journal and then she could get some credit as co-author and it would be good for her to have publication.  Right?  Instead of her working to undermine the work I'd already done let's get sections out to journals.  Let the editors tell us what needs to happen and get the minimum that they say done quickly quickly quickly for fast turnaround. There is no f*cking reason to get stuck working for deacades going over and over and over and over and over and over the same.  Get it done.  Move on.  Move forwards.  If other people want to spend the next however many years bickering about it then let them do that.  No reason to get f*cking stuck in the f*cking swamp.  1 year of research done in 1 year.  Why is that so f*cking impossible in this f*cking sh*t hole?  What University?  Where is your research output, Justine?  What is the output of the Philosophy Programme?  5,000 words per person per year?  So maybe 1 article each every 2 years?  1 article each every 5 years?  How could you guys possibly work so f*cking slow?</p>

                            <p>The point is that if she wants various things in there (that I don't really want to be in there) then put them in something that is co-authored rather than in my thesis.  Then we can see what the journal peer reviewers have to say about the sections.  Maybe they like them.  Maybe they don't.  Then do what the externals say (only) to get the f*cking thing done.  Or don't.  Then, don't Justine.  Don't have any research output at all.  Spend all your f*cking time calling garbage garbage garbage on everybody else outputting nothing of your own.  Spend all your time calling garbage garbage garbage on everything else and wonder why when you do output something the only things that other people have to say to you is garbage garbage garbage.  Nothing f*cking there.  Nobody home.  I actually thought that you would  be interested in having research output.  I actually thought that you would be interested in contributing to joint publication.  I did a lot of work.  It should not have been that f*cking hard to take parts or sections (the most technical ones would have been the  best candidates) and work something up to article length.   But instead of being constructive and productive you call garbage garbage garbage all the f*ckign time working only to undo what's been done. Hold things up.  Slow things down.  </p>

                            <p>Because it's about keeping the bums on the seats in the slave prison detention camp.  Recording ever increasing levels of debt against people's name.  While the government cry cry cry cry cries about how there aren't any skilled workers and they can't employ anybody to work on the UN declaration on human rights.  The only people they graduated from the Universities have been spending the last 6 months unpacking their bags and they haven't started any work, yet.  The Universities wouldn't enrol, wouldn't acknowledge progression through training, wouldn't graduate anybody else.  Must be the breeding of gamma babies in NZ.  The best and the brightest have been spending the last 10 f*cking years trying to find their pencils and they haven't even started work,  yet.  It's the f*cking gamma baby land down here, all right.  Chris Whelan takes hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to go blackbirding for victims to be recorded as re re re re re re re re enrolled in NZ universities.  He says he's so overwhelmed by all of the complaints of wrongdoing about NZ Universities that he receives that he can't process a single complaint!  He says they are not actually complaints of wrongdoing. All of the complaints are about personal problems. It's all very very very very personal against the student.  It's just a person problem against the studnet and there's nothing at all wrong with NZ Universities targeting students on entirely personal grounds.  How do you commit a genocide Chris Whelan?  One by one by one by one by one.  There's nothing about a 'group of people' being targeted.  COurse not.  You just go after as many as you can all opportunistically on entirely personal grounds.  Take another hundred thousand for you, Chris, call it a bonus for the personal targeting of Mason Pendrous.  Justice Toogood (injustice Toogood) didn't think that you could pinpoint his time of death on the basis of when he stopped using his internet.  Didn't think that they should take a look at the security camera footage of the public areas of his hall to see who was last seen leaving his room, even.  What University?   What Judiciary?  </p>

                            <p>I guess my whole 'I am not a direct competitor for you so lay down your f*cking weapons' is not something that has worked out for me.  I mean to say that my responding to people in that way does not seem to have worked to disarm them.  To have them stop trying to undermine and stabotage me.  When I said I wasn't going to be applying for jobs in Philosophy they didn't respond with 'okay, then, we'll stop being obstructive'.  Apparently it's because they don't get to feel like such a winner if I don't want to play their game.  They actually need me to lose.  They want me to want something that they have then that I don't have because they have it.  That seems to be the idea of it.  It isn't okay for them that I don't want to work as a philosophy academic anymore.  Because they've turned the whole thing into such a f*cking nasty nasty nasty hosile horrible thing.  They need for me to want to do it -- and then not get to do it because they are doing it instead.  Thehy need me to be playing their game and losing at it.  I don't really know what their f*cking problem is.  I get that they love to take the studnets camping and go on and on and on and on about how competitive it is that the studnets must be willing to do anyting anything anything.  Housesit on demand.  Tutor your kid in math.  Arrange for your kid to have whatever grades?  Seems likely in fact.  What University?  There's nothing there.</p>

                            <p>I do remember being very surprised, at times, to meet and speak with people who were allegedly or supposedly the author of various things.  Now, I think it highly unlikely that Kim Sterelny was actually teh author of even half of what he has been credited with in print.  I think that probably the way it goes is that the research aspect of Universities is a total scam. People already on payroll pass other people's work off as their own.  NOt sure how much it is they themselves who choose that.  How much they are personally responsible for the plagarism, I mean to say.  Or how much work is re-attributed to their name. I mean to say, as Journal Editor you get sent work.  So you look up who the people are who submitted it.  Then you indefinately delay publication until they go away.  Maybe arrnage for it to be translated out of Italian into English or similar.  THen reattribute authorship of it to someone else.  Maybe someone already on payroll somewhere else.  And, of course, people taking their research students work.  Most simplistically you can do a merge copy paste sort of output of all of your first year studnets essays on Descartes, or whatever.  Take their work and pass it off as your own.  Then you end up with all of these people on payroll and they conspire with the University administration to keep the slaves a slaving.  The people doing the work re re re re re re re enrolled while they bully them about how garbage garbage garbage their work is (keep handing it over keep handing over more and more and more and more work) sot hat they can reattribute authorship of it to someone else.  Paying various people hundreds of thousands of dollars to bully bully bully the slaves into more and more and more and more research output for no credit.</p>

                            <p>Which is of course why the research output is incresingly hostile to the university and to the government to pays more and more and more and more money to the university to record more and more and more and more and more debt against the studnets name.  F*cking psychopaths.  F*cking psychopaths.  That's what the research has to say.  F*cking psychopaths.  Nobody there.  Nothing home.  Slave.  Prison.  Detention camps.  What Judiciary? What University?  Nobody there.  Nothing home.  Can't even parse their own constitution ffs.  Stupid F*cking Retards, indeed.</p>
