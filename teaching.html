                    <li> <strong>Philosophy and Cognitive Science, </strong><em> Course design, Lecturing, tutoring, grading, Macquarie University,</em> 2010.</li>

                    <li>This is around 2/3rds of a stage 3 course that I was sub-contracted to teach because the Professor had been awarded an ARC Australian Research Council grant to research psychopathology.  She used the grant (part of it anyway) to sub-contract her teaching so that she had more time to research.  I was told what textbook to teach from by the Department Chair at the time.  He gave me  big speech about how the students at Macquarie were not very bright because Macquarie was a 'second tier' institution.  As such, a conversational textbook was more appropriate for the reading level of the students than a collection of primary sourced standard articles in the field would be.  My experience of teaching the course was that often the kids in second tier institutions are brighter and more intrinsically motivated than the kids in the first tier institutions.  But, hey, that's nothing that forcing 2 hour commutes and extended work hours in order for them to eat won't fix.  Right?  I guess it is because of corruption and the role of the parents in gifting their selfish genes all the things they perceive to be the best.  That makes the best places full of...  Garbage.  Please Ashley.  Send your kids to Harvard.  Please Prime Ministers of New Zealand.  Use your political position to collect up all the Harvard qualifications for yourself and your selfish genes.  Let other places get on with the academics, already.  There is a move to removing curriculum contents from second tier insitutions to drive up the fees (and make it more competitive) to cheat your selfish genes way into first tier institutions.  Because first tier institutions became such garbage that they focused on destroying everything else.  The real race to the bottom.   I mean check out the direction the ANU chose to go in.  Then, if every other institution in Australasia is forced to get in behind that...
