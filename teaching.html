                <ul>
                    <li> <strong>Philosophy and Cognitive Science, </strong><em> Course design, Lecturing, tutoring, grading, Macquarie University,</em> 2010.</li>

                    <li>This is around 2/3rds of a stage 3 course that I was sub-contracted to teach by an academic who wanted to use her time researching.  She had been awarded an ARC research grant to research psychopathology so she used some of that (or her University salary) to sub-contract her teaching to me.  I don't remember what textbook I was teaching from.  The lectures were designed to accompany the relevant chapter of the textbook.  I was basically trying to walk-through the contents of the text which would help serve as a prompt for the students to ask questions during the lecture.  The Department Chair told me what textbook to use for the course.  The idea was that since Macquarie was a Second Tier University I should pick an easy reader textbook rather than a collection of articles from the development of the field.  Australasia has been working very hard to remove curriculum contents from 'education' programmes.  My experience of education across different universities of different tiers is that intelligence doesn't follow the tier of the university.  That is why they work so very very hard to remove curriculum contents from certain universities.  So that it isn't so obvious that the first tier people have been selected for non-academic reasons etc.  I mean to say, it guess it is a little embarrasing when the kids from Princeton (say) are handing in work they plagarised from University of Waikato students who were forced to submit their work to TurnitIn.
