            <h2> Lecturing </h2>
            <div class="container"> 
                <ul>
                    <li> <strong>Philosophy and Cognitive Science, </strong><em> Course design, Lecturing, tutoring, grading, Macquarie University,</em> 2010.</li>

                    <li>The tenured university academic on payroll to teach this stage 3 course sub-contracted to me to teach around 2/3rds of it.  I was instructed by the department chair to teach from a particular 'easy reader' textbook and walk the kids through it since Macquarie was regarded to be a 'second tier' university and there was no expectation that anybody would do the readings or actually be particularly literate.  My job was basically to walk them through the required readings.  That meant that the relatively small class (around 30) had ample time to ask questions and discuss the content, though.  So the main value of the lectures and tutorials was the class discussion.
                    </li>

                    <li>But that is an interesting business model, isn't it?  Subcontract the work that you are paid to do to students and pay them considerably less than you are paid.  Then, of course, never get the students work out for external examination.  Say they are rubbish rubbish rubbish garbage only and the present situation is the best or most they can ever hope or expect for in life.  There will be graduation for them and paid employment only over the dead body of the person already on payroll.  The person on payroll also gets more money from research grants, of course.  They get the research grants because they are about the only applicant for the grant.  Nobody else with a PhD was a serious contender.  Nobody else is being granted their PhD.  They are kept on considerably less money as teaching sub-contractors and their work is never sent out for external examination.  They will never get their PhD.  They will never have their research proposals considered on their merits.  The people presently on the payroll are the only alternative.  The only game in town.  There will be graduation for others and paid employment for them to be independent only over the dead bodies of the people presently collecting up all of the money for keeping slaves a slaving.  Having them reenrolled and reenrolled and reenrolled in the University.  Recording only greater levels of debt against their name.  What research output?  What quality teaching?  It's soooooo competitive.  Some people are paid money to eliminate an entire generation of people, seems to be the case.  Put them to work without pay then vanish them.  So they can have for themselves the lives they believe they are entitled to.  All of the pay for them.  All of the everything for them to keep slaves.</li>

                    <li>There is apparently some issue as to who is regarded to own the following since I developed the presentation or teaching notes while I was employed by MacQuarie University.  Maybe they can tell a fourth year student to read out my powerpoint notes to the third years, next year, for even less pay.  That is what Auckland Univesrity does.  Right?  Pays second year students to work as laboratory teaching assistants to first year students.  Put the second years to work lording over the first years.  Selling the answers?  How are they supposed to make a living?  What education and training system?  </li>
