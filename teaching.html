            <div class="container"> 
                <ul>
                    <li> <strong>Philosophy and Cognitive Science, </strong><em> Course design, Lecturing, tutoring, grading, Macquarie University,</em> 2010.</li>

                    <li>The Department Chair told me what textbook to prescribe for this course.  I do not now remember what the book was.  I wrote the lecture slides as a walk-through to help unpack or explain the content of the text-book.  The last topic was an exception.  I introduced the students to current research being done in psychology at Macquarie.  Their understanding of this was not assessed as they were busy writing their final essay on topics already covered.  It was not my decision to teach from that textbook.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                    Jeannette Kinnett was granted an Australian Research something or other which paid her to do research.  She spent the research money sub-contracting out some of her teaching work.  She told me that she wasn't given enough money to contract me to teach the entire course (all the lectures 1x2 hour lecture + 1x 1 hour tutorial) -- but most of them.  So, she taught a unit at the start of the course and took the main responsibility, I suppose, as Professor.  And then I was paid (I don't remember at what rate) to teach the rest of it.  So the following was not the entire course, just the portion of the course that I was teaching (I think it was around 3/4 of the course).
                    </li>

                    <li>Bill Fish (Massey) said something about how he was given enough Research funding to sub-contract out all his teaching work, pretty much, too.  Such that he spent most of his time overseas, even, and not even in New Zealand.  Certainly not in Palmerston North.  The idea was that if you play your cards right then you could have a lucractive career also where you can fly about the world to party party party.  What I found particularly abhorrent, in all this, was how he would skip out on other people's talks (not attend any of the talks in timeslots in conferences) because he was hiding away in his room writing or polishing or finishing his own talk.  I mean...  Just doing a bit sh*t all over the whole thing.  Not being respectful of other people's work (not turning up and being a positive contributor) and just being f*cking selfish.  I guess that's why New Zealand chose to hire him (he was not a graduate of a New Zealand University).  So we know what it is that they value.  For sure.  So motivating and inspiring to a new generation of students in New Zealand.  To play their cards right and be just like Bill Fish.  That's worth many many years of doing anything he says anything anything anything creating motivation and desire for students to be falling over each other to do anything anything anything...  That makes the whole entire thing worth precisely nothing at all.  They don't pay him to do philosophy.  They pay him to undermine the University.  Never could overseas have sent a better...  Trojan Horse.  I think that's it.  That's what you call it.  I don't think he has campaigning for change from within.  Or conducting himself with honesty and integrity at all.  Maybe he's changed..  But that's the Bill Fish I saw.  Do I want to join him?  No.  I feel sick.  Must be that something's wrong with me.  I seem to have gone off my Joy.
