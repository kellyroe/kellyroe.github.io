This folder  is going to be a repository for the PDF's that are published.

The PDFs kept in here are simple copies of PDF files that are generated and kept in other locations.

Other locations are documents/working/articles and documents/working/reports and documents/working/cv

I need to manually place new or altered (e.g., recompiled) PDFs into this location and push any changes to Git in order for them to actually publish.

The main benefit of having this file is:

(1) one convenient place where the files published on the net are to be kept
 
(2) pushing the files to Git will create an online location.  I need to figure out the relative file path information to generate functioning links (e.g., cv.pdf will contain internal working links to 2003:1.pdf)
