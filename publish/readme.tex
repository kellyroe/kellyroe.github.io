This folder  is going to be a repository for the PDF's that are published.

The PDFs kept in here are simple copies of PDF files that are generated and kept in other locations.

Other locations include: 
- documents/working/articles and 
- documents/working/reports and 
- documents/working/cv

I need to manually place new or altered (e.g., recompiled) PDFs into this location and push any changes to Git in order for them to actually publish.

The main benefit of having this folder with it's location is:

(1) one convenient place where the PDF files published on the net are to be kept

(2) pushing the files to Git will itself create an online location for relative file paths that I can use inside the PDF documents themselves.

(3)  e.g., of an absolute file path:  https://kellyroe.github.io/publish/2023.cv

(4) e.g., of a relative file path (to anything kept inside this particular folder):
<a href="2023:1.pdf">Should work</a> 

(5) use relative file paths so the 'publish' folder is portable.  Don't change the name of any of the PDF's or the location else the links will break!
